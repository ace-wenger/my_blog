I'm a researcher and educator interested in the critical evaluation of education research and its application to actual students and teachers.
I recently graduated with a PhD from the Mallinson Institute for Science Education at Western Michigan University.
I am developing a research program which investigates the methods, results, and impact of studies in education to empower teachers and administrators with more robust recommendations.

I am passionate about education at all levels and the development of knowledge, skills, and character in the next generation.
I have taught biology and chemistry at various levels (8th grade to undergraduate)
I aspire to be a lifelong learner and enjoy reading of diverse subjects, as well as developing my skills as a researcher.

See my [CV](Resume__research.pdf) for a complete listing of my education, work, and experience.

## Key research interests
- Meta-research methods, such as systematic review and meta-analysis

- Role of evidence in educational policy and practice 

## Teaching and public engagement interests
- Scientific methods, experimental design, causal inference, and philosophy of science
- Introductory and advanced biology subjects, particularly microbiology and molecular biology
- History of educational psychology and science education
- Statistical and computational research methods using R, especially computational reproducibility
