AB  - Reductionist methods of learning and teaching chemistry have indeed advanced the disciplinary knowledge. However, they have proven deficient in connecting the chemical reactions of elements in the periodic table with the significant impacts they have on planetary and societal systems. Therefore, a systems thinking approach is required that integrates an interdisciplinary and complementary understanding of chemical concepts. Systems Oriented Concept Map Extensions (SOCME)s are an effective tool to connect interdisciplinary subsystems to the larger planetary boundaries and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). We present a course activity where undergraduate students of an introductory green chemistry and sustainable synthesis course selected an element from the periodic table and a simple chemical reaction involving that element, to develop a SOCME. Students applied green chemistry principles, life cycle thinking and circular economy concepts to the various subsystems in their SOCME. Students also recommended an alternative greener subsystem based on their integrated understanding and research from primary literature. They connected the impacts from the subsystems of the element/reaction and the alternative greener reaction to the earth, health, economy, and society to address global challenges represented by the UN SDGs. They effectively communicated the science in their SOCME poster through a video presentation in a virtual format. Student survey data indicated that the systems, life cycle and circularity thinking connected to the UN SDGs, improved their knowledge of the wider impacts of chemistry in the world. It also increased their awareness of the role of chemists in promoting environmental and social justice. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction.Health informatics curricular content, while beneficial to the spectrum of education in physical therapy, is currently only required in physical therapist education programs, and even there, it is only crudely defined. The purpose of our study was to use the techniques of concept analysis and concept mapping to provide an outline of informatics content that can be the foundation for curriculum development and the construction of informatics competencies for physical therapy.Review of Literature.There is no established consensus on the definition of health informatics. Medical and nursing informatics literature that clarifies and agrees on the attributes of health informatics is insufficient for curriculum development. Concept analysis is an approach commonly used in nursing and other health professions to analyze and deconstruct a term, in this case, health informatics, in order to provide clarity on its meaning.Subjects.A total of 73 definitions of health informatics were extracted from articles that met search criteria.Methods.We used an 8-step methodology from the literature for concept analysis, which included 1) selecting a concept; 2) determining the aims of the analysis; 3) identifying uses of the concept; 4) determining the defining attributes of the concept; 5) identifying a model case; 6) identifying related and illegitimate cases; 7) identifying antecedents and consequences; and 8) defining empirical referents. In addition, concept mapping was used to develop a visual representation of the thematic attributes and the elements that make them up.Results.We provide a visual map of the concept we now term "informatics in human health and health care"and clarify its attributes of data, disciplinary lens, multidisciplinary science, technology, and application. We also provide clarification through the presentation of a model case and a contrary case.Discussion and Conclusion.Concept analysis and mapping of informatics in human health and health care provided clarity on content that should be addressed across the continuum of physical therapy education. The next steps from this work will be to develop competencies for all levels of physical therapy education. © Copyright 2022 Academy of Physical Therapy Education, APTA Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.

AB  - Introduction: Video-based review of surgical procedures has proven to be useful in training by enabling efficiency in the qualitative assessment of surgical skill and intraoperative decision-making. Current video segmentation protocols focus largely on procedural steps. Although some operations are more complex than others, many of the steps in any given procedure involve an intricate choreography of basic maneuvers such as suturing, knot tying, and cutting. The use of these maneuvers at certain procedural steps can convey information that aids in the assessment of the complexity of the procedure, surgical preference, and skill. Our study aims to develop and evaluate an algorithm to identify these maneuvers. Methods: A standard deep learning architecture was used to differentiate between suture throws, knot ties, and suture cutting on a data set comprised of videos from practicing clinicians (N = 52) who participated in a simulated enterotomy repair. Perception of the added value to traditional artificial intelligence segmentation was explored by qualitatively examining the utility of identifying maneuvers in a subset of steps for an open colon resection. Results: An accuracy of 84% was reached in differentiating maneuvers. The precision in detecting the basic maneuvers was 87.9%, 60%, and 90.9% for suture throws, knot ties, and suture cutting, respectively. The qualitative concept mapping confirmed realistic scenarios that could benefit from basic maneuver identification. Conclusions: Basic maneuvers can indicate error management activity or safety measures and allow for the assessment of skill. Our deep learning algorithm identified basic maneuvers with reasonable accuracy. Such models can aid in artificial intelligence-assisted video review by providing additional information that can complement traditional video segmentation protocols. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The use of primary literature can be an effective way to expose students to the scientific research process. At the same time, primary literature can be intimidating to many students, particularly those with limited exposure to science research. The CREATE (consider, read, elucidate hypotheses, analyze and interpret the data, and think of the next experiment) method is an evidence-based teaching strategy that uses a structured series of pedagogical tools to allow students to perform intensive analysis of primary literature. The use of CREATE in biology classes increased student self-rated attitudes, confidence, and understanding of science. On the basis of these prior reports, we implemented CREATE in a one-semester, stand-alone, undergraduate chemistry course in which students analyzed a linked series of primary literature articles tracking the trajectory of a specific area of chemistry research. The course was aimed at second-year students, and our goals were to increase student confidence in engaging scientific literature, demystify the scientific process, and help students see themselves as having a role in that process. Pre- and post-course surveys indicated significant increases in understanding of the scientific process, along with gains in self-rated skills and attitudes related to science. Students also demonstrated gains in course content knowledge as assessed by a pre- and post-course concept mapping exercise. Thus, the CREATE method has been implemented in a chemistry teaching context that resulted in increased student knowledge. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Self-directed learning in an appropriately designed environment can help learners retain knowledge tied to experience and motivate them to learn more. For teachers, however, it is difficult to design an environment to give to learners and to give feedback that reflects respect for their independent efforts, while for learners, it is difficult to set learning objectives on their own and to construct knowledge correctly based on their own efforts. In this research, we developed a learning support system that provides a mechanism for constructing an observational learning environment using virtual space and that encourages self-directed knowledge discovery. We confirmed that this system contributes to a learner's structural understanding and its retention and to a greater desire to learn at a level comparable to that of concept map creation, another active learning method. © 2023 The Institute of Electronics.

AB  - The way in which one understands information and concepts, and the way a student works to develop this, is an individual aspect of learning that cannot be universally defined as (at least manifested) the same for everyone. ‘Understanding’ is a broad term, and the way one achieves understanding is dependent on the way that material is presented. In this article, we argue that the philosophy of science can be important to nursing education—in particular, by showing that the way we imbue understanding might depend on the meaning of ‘understanding’. Diagrams and concept maps are meant to guide newly formed knowledge and connections to develop proper thinking (e.g., the order in which nursing students must prioritize data) that a student requires in the field. We argue that whether or not an image/diagram/concept map confers understanding will depend on both what the object is and what we mean by ‘understanding’. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Online learning has become an essential part of mainstream higher education. With increasing enrollments in online anatomy courses, a better understanding of effective teaching techniques for the online learning environment is critical. Active learning has previously shown many benefits in face-to-face anatomy courses, including increases in student satisfaction. Currently, no research has measured student satisfaction with active learning techniques implemented in an online graduate anatomy course. This study compares student satisfaction across four different active learning techniques (jigsaw, team-learning module, concept mapping, and question constructing), with consideration of demographics and previous enrollment in anatomy and/or online courses. Survey questions consisted of Likert-style, multiple-choice, ranking, and open-ended questions that asked students to indicate their level of satisfaction with the active learning techniques. One hundred seventy Medical Science master's students completed the online anatomy course and all seven surveys. Results showed that students were significantly more satisfied with question constructing and jigsaw than with concept mapping and team-learning module. Additionally, historically excluded groups (underrepresented racial minorities) were generally more satisfied with active learning than non-minority groups. Age, gender, and previous experience with anatomy did not influence the level of satisfaction. However, students with a higher-grade point average (GPA), those with only a bachelor's degree, and those with no previous online course experience were more satisfied with active learning than students who had a lower GPA, those holding a graduate/professional degree, and those with previous online course experience. Cumulatively, these findings support the beneficial use of active learning in online anatomy courses. © 2023 American Association for Anatomy.

AB  - This article presents a SoTL study of students’ use of concept maps in my undergraduate class “Women in Christian History,” in a mid-semester module called “the Eve project.” I present three students’ maps to show the different kinds of understandings that students developed in this literacy encounter. I am especially interested in how I can read these learning artifacts as a humanities scholar, and I use humanities theory—in this case, new materialism—to understand aspects of my students’ map-making, with a focus on the keyword “work.” I argue that the maps in my study, read through a new materialist lens, functioned as working objects in a manner that encouraged “differenciation” (inviting students to move toward multiple undefined learning outcomes), and that this is quite different from the work of “differentiation” (ranking students according to predefined learning outcomes) that concept maps traditionally perform in science classes. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - This article demonstrates that didactic videos have the potential to enhance quality perception, performance and interest in engineering education. Emergency Remote Learning (ERL) imposed challenging conditions on education, and its impact was especially noticeable in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This is mainly due to intrinsic cognitive load associated with the high presence of abstract concepts and to difficulties to establish connections among subjects to foster generative processing. Suitable integration of multimedia resources might be beneficial in both regards. The use of didactic videos as pedagogical aid is expected to yield positive results in electrical engineering education, mitigating the impact caused by ERL situations. Using concept maps to identify key concepts in the Electrical Engineering BSc, this article proposes the creation and integration of nine videos to enhance conceptual learning and the creation of links among subjects. This study encompassed three academic years (from 2019 to 2022), covering pre-ERL, ERL and post-ERL scenarios, and considering a total sample of 157 students. By using a Mixed Methods research design, this study has demonstrated how the integration of didactic videos mitigated the negative effects of the unprecedented ERL conditions, with positive impact on students' perception on videos' implications in enhancing their interest and understanding of the subject's concepts. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Conflict regulation is deemed a highly important lifelong learning skill with which individuals should be equipped. This study sought to measure the effect of achievement goal orientations on socio-cognitive conflict regulation strategies and to assess the impact of designated learning activity with collaborative digital concept mapping on these strategies. Data were gathered from 66 second-year Social Sciences undergraduate students on the completion of the learning activity. Results mainly showed that the learning activity with digital concept mapping positively contributed to students’ collaborative and critical socio-cognitive conflict regulation strategies rather than competitive strategies. Performance goal orientation increased less competitive collaborative socio-cognitive conflict regulation strategies. These findings underscore the importance of equipping individuals with a set of skills that enables them to effectively regulate conflicts by engaging them in socio-cognitive argumentation activities during their educational attainment. Such activities may raise their awareness of more collaborative strategies of regulation when faced with different types of conflict situations. © 2023 International Association for Conflict Management.

AB  - This paper describes the development and the envisioned use of concept maps in the framework of the SENTIERI communication strategies as an information and sci- entific communication tool applied to epidemiological surveillance in contaminated sites. The concept map of SENTIERI 2019-2022 was designed and implemented to foster access to complex scientific information ensuring usability of the contents and com- munication with the various stakeholders. The concept map aims to promote environmental health literacy in contaminated sites. The methodology adopted to create the map includes the following phases: 1. choice of a dynamic focus question; 2. selection of the representative terms of the addressed topics; 3. elaboration of the glossary of the selected terms; 4. representation of the links among the selected terms; 5. identification of the significant propositions that make explicit the meaning of each link. Online access to the map is guaranteed by the Mindomo software. The use of the concept map promotes active learning of the topics that characterize SENTIERI 2019-2022 through knowledge paths chosen because of the specifi in- terests and learning purposes. The concept map derives from the integration of specific approaches of the epidemiological discipline with those of the social sciences and offers the possibility of develop- ing site-specific maps through the interactions with local actors and the integration of elements related to emerging problems as well as institutional and local interests. © 2023, Inferenze Scarl.

AB  - Background: Although concept maps have been strongly advocated for by curriculum developers as a learning method in theory to promote critical thinking and problem –solving abilities for students, there has been widespread criticism of their use in nursing and midwifery curricula. The critic is related to being out-dated, context- driven and decontextualized with little effort of connection to student nurse ‘daily life. The majority of research about concept maps was carried out in western countries. Additionally, little is known about experiences of utilizing concept maps in other contexts. Therefore, in attempt to understand its effectiveness, context specific studies should be undertaken. Aim: The aim of this study was to explore and describe the experiences of utilizing a concept maps as a learning method in human anatomy and physiology. Design: The study employed an explorative, descriptive qualitative approach, with three written open-ended questions. Settings: The study was conducted at the public university in the north east in Namibia. Participants: Fifteen nursing students enrolled in a Bachelor of Nursing Science (Clinical) (Honours) at the public university in the north east in Namibia. Methods: The study enlisted the participation of 15 second and first-year nursing students, who were chosen using a convenience sampling approach. Data were collected by the researcher from 27 September until 18 October 2021. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data, which were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Data analysis led to the emergence of the following themes: Understanding of a concept map, positive experiences, negative experiences, and corrective measures to improve the utilisation of CMs. Conclusion: The findings of this study demonstrate that nursing students have both positive and negative experiences with the use of concept maps, indicating a need for improvement. Targeted interventions and strategies should be adopted to promote the utilization of concept maps as a learning method in biological sciences, so as to reinforce the mastery of learning content in human anatomy and biological science. This study recommends well-articulated plans and actions from curricular developers and educators to support and guide students through the process of developing concept maps. The guarantee of using concept maps to reach the full value of competency it was designed to achieve, calls for students to engage in more practice opportunities to reinforce the mastery of using this learning method. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - In this study, we used propositional concept maps with different ocean-related conceptual sentences to assess the ocean literacy of maritime vocational high school students in Grades 10–12 in Indonesia. Indonesia is the world’s largest archipelagic country, and many aspects of people’s lives, including their jobs, are related to the ocean. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the ocean literacy and related knowledge of students, especially maritime vocational high school students. Thus, in this study, an open-ended questionnaire was employed to acquire data from 255 students at the National Vocational High School 1 Temon in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A total of 215 males and 40 females participated in this study. In addition to descriptive analysis, we used a one-way analysis of variance and a t-test for statistical inference. The results showed that 11th and 12th graders scored significantly higher in ocean literacy than 10th graders, and female students significantly outperformed male students. Furthermore, student learning was teacher-centered. In this paper, we summarize the results and provide suggestions and references concerning ocean literacy for teachers and high school students. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Science educators highlight the importance of developing systems thinking (ST) and futures thinking (FT) for students to make decisions and to be active citizens that address socioscientific problems. The dimensions related to FT take in this study were three implied in ST and two in the appropriation of the future. The aim of this study is to analyse the level of FT-related dimensions developed by a group of pre-service elementary teachers and how far different activities designed to foster them were effective. Written explanations presented by the participants about the origin of pandemics and possible ways to prevent them, as well as videos developed by small groups with the goal to present a campaign for avoiding future pandemics, were analysed. Based on the literature, five dimensions and up to four levels of performances were identified. After completing the activities, participants were able to relate the three spheres of the “One Health” notion to explain the causes of pandemics. Moreover, they established complex cause-effect relationships between the different factors, although they only constructed monocausal relationships when proposing measures. Participants improved their performance in anticipating the future and identifying themselves as agents of change. The elaboration of concept maps facilitated the development of components and behaviour ST dimensions, and the design of the campaign allowed participants to identify themselves as agents of change. The use of these strategies in science education can contribute to the development of a citizenry capable of understanding and acting on systems. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Regulatory medicines risk communications aim to prevent patient harm through the dissemination of safety information to healthcare professionals (HCPs), patients, and the public. Evidence suggests that in addition to implementing the required changes, HCPs also respond to these communications through unintended and unwarranted actions and behaviours such as stopping medicine courses unnecessarily, and blanket actions spilling over to unintended patients' populations. Misunderstanding and mis-implementation of medicines risk communications could jeopardise patients’ safety and clinical outcomes. Therefore, it is important to understand the determinants that affect HCPs responses to medicines risk communications. This systematic review aims to identify the factors that affect the implementation of risk communications by healthcare professionals. Methods: Fifteen databases, including EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, CINAHL PLUS were searched in April–May 2018, and the search was updated again in June 2021 to identify studies reporting on factors influencing HCPs' uptake of medicine risk alerts. We used keywords such as risk communication, safety update, and safety regulation. Studies were excluded if they did not involve pharmacovigilance or patient safety alerts; or if they only focused on measuring HCPs' practice after alerts; or evaluating the effectiveness of risk minimisation measures without reporting on factors affecting HCPs’ actions. Studies relating to occupational hazards, case reports, interventional studies, and studies not involving HCPs were also excluded. The Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to assess the quality of the included studies. A Narrative synthesis approach was undertaken using thematic analysis and concept mapping, followed by a critical reflection of the synthesis. Results: Twenty-eight studies met our criteria and were included in the synthesis. We identified four themes summarising the factors influencing HCPs’ implementation of risk communications. These include HCPs: knowledge of medicine alerts; perceptions of alerts; attitudes, and concerns regarding medicine alerts; and the self-reported impact of these alerts. Our concept mapping exercise identified key interactions between different stakeholders, and these interactions determine HCPs' implementation of medicine risk communications. These stakeholders comprise of alert developers, including the sources and senders of safety information, and the receivers of safety information including health care institutions, HCPs, patients and their carers. Conclusions: Healthcare professionals are crucial to translating risk communication messages into clinical practice. However, if they have inadequate information about the content of the alert, and have inaccurate perceptions about the alert, they may not implement the required clinical changes as intended. Communication of medicine risk alerts does not always translate into improved patient care, due to a complex interaction between stakeholders involved in the creation and implementation of these alerts. These complex interactions should be the subject of future research efforts to understand the alert-implementation trajectory and identify the mediators for change and interventions to improve implementation. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - The theory of evolution can be a useful basis for developing students’ understanding of ecology. Our study used concept maps to examine the development of sixth-grade students’ understanding of the Antarctic ecosystem following several evolution ‘Science Days’ conducted at ‘Nature Campus’–an informal learning environment comprised of a natural history museum, zoological and botanical gardens. The programme included physical experiences, such as observations and measurements of fossils, skeletons and mounted specimens, and observations in the zoological and botanical gardens. After the first and fourth days, the students watched the film ‘March of the Penguins,’ and were asked to draw concept maps depicting the penguins’ lives. These maps were then analysed to assess: (a) the changes in the students’ depictions of the ecosystem’s complexity, and (b) the manner and extent to which they used ideas and concepts in evolution to explain phenomena in the Antarctic ecosystem. We found that the students’ concept maps increased in complexity, and their post-maps incorporated concepts in evolution from their experiences at Nature Campus. Our results therefore emphasise the benefits of fundamentally changing how biology education is divided and defined, and transitioning to a more holistic approach that acknowledges the interdisciplinary nature of biological phenomena. © 2021 Royal Society of Biology.

AB  - The historical origins of concept maps are in Science Education. In 1972, Joseph Novak created this knowledge representation technique to identify conceptual changes in topics in Biology. After 50 years, concept maps are approaching maturity at a time of enormous social transformations caused by the Covid-19 pandemic that impact Education. The authors take advantage of the celebration of the 50th anniversary of concept maps to reflect on the stagnation or growth of research on concept maps, considering the specific production in Science Education. This paper aims to reflect on the current moment of research on concept maps from the analysis of academic literature and a historical perspective of the development and application of concept maps. The perspectives on the horizon suggest that growth is more likely than stagnation if two conditions are fulfilled by researchers and professors: (1) the expansion of theoretical perspectives that inform the use of concept maps and (2) the adoption of a new set of values that emphasize educational praxis as a process, avoiding the focus on the product that characterizes a final point in the learning process. © 2022 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Instituto de Fisica.

AB  - Background: Developing strategies to change health behaviour is one of the biggest challenges of health promotion programs. Social media, as a popular and innovative communication and education tool, offers opportunities to modify health behaviour. While literature on using social media for health promotion campaigns is growing, there is a need to evaluate the approaches used to change health behaviour, rather than only creating awareness. Objective: The paper reviewed the literature on application of social media in health promotion campaigns with a particular focus on the methodologies used in assessing the outcome of the programs for behaviour change. This fills the void in collating evidence to extend health promotion campaigns to effect sustainable behavioural change. Method: Peer-reviewed articles were identified through multiple science databases. A systematic electronic search was conducted to retrieve review and original papers published between January 2010 and April 2022. The titles and abstracts of the articles were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. All authors independently read the full texts and discussed them to reach a consensus about the themes. Concept mapping was used to present results from analysis of the included papers. Results: Of the 674 citations, 28 (4.1%) studies were included in this review. The methodology approaches of 18 (2.7%) papers, that aimed to evaluate the impact of social media in health promotion campaigns towards behaviour change, were analysed further using concept mapping. The results showed that 10 studies (55.5%) adopted quantitative methods and five studies (27.7%) used mixed methods and three studies (16.6%) used qualitative methods. Facebook and YouTube were used more for intervention purposes to change health behaviour. Twitter and Instagram were used more to observe the trend of changes in health behaviour. Six studies (33.3%) adopted Social Cognitive Theory and one study (5.5%) applied the Transtheoretical Model as the framework to evaluate the outcome. Overall, the results show that though social media has potential in promoting behaviour change, the estimation of this change in long-term lies outside the scope of social media health campaigns. This is also reflected in the methodologies used in existing studies to assess such sustainable changes. The employed measures usually target immediate behaviour or social media engagement rather than addressing the change on a behavioural level. Conclusion: Evaluating the performance of social media campaigns to promote health behaviours towards a sustainable outcome is a complex process. Emerging research is focused on evaluating the potential of social media as an opportunity to create awareness. Such measures require less effort in quantifying and isolating the effect. The design of the campaigns is required to be aligned in relation to stages of the behaviour change. The study provides suggestions on how this can be achieved. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This research provides an overview of the current state of scientific literature related to suicide and physical activity (PA). A bibliometric analysis of studies published between 1996 and 2022 in The Web of Science (WoS) was carried out, applying the traditional bibliometric laws, using Microsoft Excel and the VOSviewer software for data and metadata processing. A total of 368 documents (349 primary research and 19 reviews) were extracted from 70 WoS categories. The results revealed an exponential increase in scientific production from 2017 to 2022 (R2 = 88%), revealing the United States hegemony being the most productive country, with 156 of the publications (42.4%), the most cited (4181 citations) being the centre of a collaborative network with links to 35 countries and having April Smith, from the Miami University, as the most prolific author (eight publications) and Thomas Joiner, from the Florida State University, as the most cited author (513 citations). The Psychiatry WoS category, with 155 papers, had the highest number of publications, and The Journal of Affective Disorders, from Elsevier, had the highest number of published papers within this category. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The goal of this research was to determine students’ perceived self-efficacy in science classes through involving students in expanding disciplinary core idea (DCI) and interdisciplinary core idea (ICI) maps, as a method to visualize knowledge (utilizing mind mapping and concept mapping) to support students to integrate interdisciplinary learning. The research involved (a) creating (by science educators) eight curriculum-related, disciplinary core idea maps and two interdisciplinary core idea maps; (b) teachers guiding students in an experimental group, to make interdisciplinary connections so as to expand DCI and ICI maps in an intervention lasting a year and a half from grade 10 to 11; (c) providing feedback on students’ developed DCI and ICI maps; (d) administering questionnaires seeking students’ perceptions about their self-efficacy towards core ideas, both before and after the intervention and (e) interviewing science teachers (5) and selected students (25), after the intervention, about their perceptions towards the use and outcomes of their DCI and ICI maps. Besides the experimental group, a control group (no intervention) was involved. Results: Outcomes showed that the intervention (guiding students in creating disciplinary and interdisciplinary core idea maps to visualize their learning) supported students significantly in their perceived self-efficacy in the fields of Life Science and Earth Science, plus in the use of Models and Systems. In Physics and Chemistry, the students’ perceived self-efficacy was not statistically significantly positive after the conducted intervention. This stemmed from disciplinary core ideas, related to Physics and Chemistry, being more abstract, with students making fewer connections and integrating less new knowledge into the related DCI and ICI maps. In the interviews, both teachers and students stated that the intervention (including expansion of DCI and ICI maps) supported students’ science learning. Conclusions: Creating and expanding disciplinary and interdisciplinary core ideas more clearly indicates students’ learning, through their ability to make meaningful connections, enabling students to raise their self-efficacy in preparing for their future. The results from this research demonstrate that students’ perceived self-efficacy can occur through knowledge visualization by expanding both DCI and ICI maps enabling the making of greater interdisciplinary connections. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Concept maps have been verified as an effective learning tool in technology-supported learning environments, in particular, in K-12 education. To enable educational technology researchers and school teachers to thoroughly know the research foci and applications of concept maps in technology-supported learning environments for K-12 education (CM-K12), the present study conducted a systematic review of studies published in seven SSCI (Social Science Citation Index) journals of educational technology by referring to the technology-based learning model. The review results showed that concept maps mostly played the role of a personal Mindtool and a collaborative Mindtool, and were mainly applied in elementary schools. The majority of elementary school teachers employed concept maps as a collaborative Mindtool (for a learning group), a personal Mindtool (for individual students), and a learning design tool. As for secondary school teachers, concept maps were mostly adopted as an assessment and evaluation tool, personal Mindtools, and collaborative Mindtools. In terms of application issues, the most adopted medium was desk-top computers, and the most adopted application domains were science, engineering, and language. The research focus explored the most in CM-K12 research was cognition, followed by affect and learning behavior. Based on the findings, several recommendations are proposed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This study compares the level of digital competence of Spanish higher education teachers in the use of three types of ICT resources in the classroom: digital tools to consume information, digital tools to produce information, and emerging technologies. To measure the level of competence, the validated DigCompEdu Check-In instrument with an ex post facto design is used. The sample consists of 2180 university teachers from Andalusia (Spain) working in different areas of knowledge: Arts and Humanities, Sciences, Health Sciences, Engineering and Architecture, Social and Legal Sciences; and classified into three levels of teaching experience: between 0–5 years, 6–14 years, and 15 years or more. The results show that teachers with 15 or more years of experience represent the group with the most significant differences in regard to their level of digital competence when comparing the use of the three types of ICT resources; furthermore, the results were similar for all areas of knowledge. In addition, the visualization or creation of videos, as well as the visualization or creation of posters and concept maps, are the resources that were found to be most significant for the three levels of experience. For each specific area, it is recommended that each of their results is analysed in detail. Finally, further research is recommended to validate these preliminary findings in each of the knowledge areas. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The ability to manage the COVID-19 pandemic is contingent upon the ability to effectively manage its heterogeneous knowledge resources. Knowledge mapping represents a great opportunity to create value by bringing stakeholders together, facilitating comprehensive collaboration and facilitating broader in-depth knowledge sharing and transfer. However, identifying and analysing critical knowledge areas is one of the most important steps when creating a knowledge map. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to appraise the critical knowledge areas for managing COVID-19, and thereby enhance decision-making in tackling the consequences of the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The methodological approach for this study is a critical literature review, covering publications on knowledge management, knowledge mapping and COVID-19. EBSCOhost, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, TRID, Web of Science and Wiley Online Library were searched for full text, peer-reviewed articles written in English that investigated on critical knowledge areas for managing the spread of COVID-19. After full screening, 21 articles met the criteria for inclusion and were analysed and reported. Findings: The study revealed seven critical knowledge areas for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. These are cleaning and disinfection; training, education and communication; reporting guidance and updates; testing; infection control measures, personal protective equipment; and potential COVID-19 transmission in health and other care settings. The study developed a concept knowledge map illustrating areas of critical knowledge which decision-makers need to be aware of. Practical implications: Providing decision-makers with access to key knowledge during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be crucial for effective decision-making. This study has provided insights for the professionals and decision-makers identifying the critical knowledge areas for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Social implications: The study advances the literature on knowledge management and builds a theoretical link with the management of public health emergencies. Additionally, the findings support the theoretical position that knowledge maps facilitate decision-making and help users to identify critical knowledge areas easily and effectively. Originality/value: This study fills gaps in the existing literature by providing an explicit representation of know-how for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper uses an objective and qualitative approach by reviewing related publications, reports and guidelines in the analysis. The concept map illustrates the critical knowledge areas for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Chemistry has played a central role over the past century in the large-scale anthropogenic transformation of matter into diverse materials that have improved the quality of life for many people on our planet. The lens of chemistry is fundamentally necessary to understand the resulting flux of chemical substances in Earth system processes, the unintended consequences of those transformations, impacts on food supply security, water and energy concerns, ways to mediate and adapt to climate change, loss of biodiversity, and how best to build and maintain resilient ecosystems. Reactive nitrogen compounds (Nr) such as ammonia from the industrial fixation of atmospheric nitrogen exemplify both the central importance of chemistry in providing food and meeting basic human needs for a global population of 8 billion people and the sustainability challenges arising from the intended and unintended consequences of large-scale human production and release of Nr. The chemistry profession can use systems thinking (ST) tools and the Planetary Boundaries framework to understand and address challenges facing the entire Earth system resulting from the altered biogeochemical flows of nitrogen. This analysis has compelling priority due to the roles Nr currently plays in global food production and ammonia's potential role as an energy carrier for large-scale human activities in a future low carbon economy and as a domestic refrigerant while hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are being phased out. As this example illustrates, navigating the complex benefits and challenges large-scale human activity imposes on Earth system processes requires the convergence of chemistry research, industrial practice, and education. Since the chemical reactions and processes that transform matter are foundational to sustainability challenges, this perspective maps, through a chemistry for sustainability pyramid, ‘multiple levels at which chemistry can contribute toward the emergence of sustainability of the Earth system'. We conclude with recommendations for steps the profession of chemistry can take to make education relevant and engaging and to connect chemistry research and practice to cross-disciplinary sustainability challenges, thereby transforming the science of transformation of matter toward sustainability. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The properties and functions of complex systems apply across a variety of domains of science and are at the heart of the solutions to many global crises facing the world today. As such, understanding of complex systems has been increasingly recognized as a core goal of science education. Learning about complexity-related concepts and phenomena is persistently considered difficult for many students—even at the undergraduate level, but traditional pedagogical approaches have been unsuccessful in teaching complex systems effectively. Evidence indicates that agent-based participatory simulations can be promising for this purpose. Using mixed methods, cross-case analysis, we examined how undergraduates experience changes in their understanding of the watershed as a complex ecosystem with the use of a particular agent-based participatory simulation called the UVA Bay Game. While one of the cases yielded evidence of nonsignificant quantitative change between pre- and post-simulation concept maps, this study observed an overall positive increase of complex system understanding through both concept map analysis and narrative reflections on learning. Our findings extend the current understanding of the role of participatory agent-based simulations in teaching and learning about complex systems in classrooms. Implications and limitations are discussed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Objective: A bibliometric analysis of COVID-19 is conducted to examine the developmental context, research hotspots, and frontiers of mental health. Methods: Using the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC), we have retrieved articles on mental health research related to COVID-19 which were published between 2019 and 2021. The coauthorship of countries, institutes, and authors was analyzed using VOSviewer 1.6.17, and the co-citation map of authors/references was analyzed as well. CiteSpace version 5.8.R3 was used to analyze keyword clusters and forecast research frontiers. Results: There were 8,856 articles retrieved, including 10,559 research institutes and 1,407 academic journals. The most published country and institutes were the United States (2190) and the University of London (373). Wang, Chengyu owned the highest co-citations (1810). Frontier topics can be identified by trending keywords, including “anxiety,” “depression,” “psychological distress,” “quarantine,” “post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),” “insomnia,” and “Healthcare workers.” Conclusion: The most common psychological problems of people during the epidemic are anxiety and depression. Insomnia and PTSD need to be solved under the normalization of the epidemic. GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales are the most convenient and effective for screening anxiety and depression. Healthcare workers, older adults, and college students should be concerned, and social and family support is essential. Copyright © 2022 Zhou, Lin, Xu, Lin and Wu.

AB  - While the use of technology in education has been rapidly increasing worldwide, the diversity and availability of information and study materials have been increasing at an even faster rate. However, presenting and explaining key course concepts in an effective and organized manner, as well as involving students in interactive learning experiences, are still key parts of teaching in higher education, more specifically, in achieving the educational objectives in the fundamental courses of science and engineering programs. Keeping this in prime consideration, the use of concept maps in basic engineering courses has been very effective and has gained growing attention in recent years. This work studied the use of a concept map in an undergraduate dynamics class. A two-phase hierarchical approach was used to construct two concept maps which were then demonstrated in the beginning of the course to allow students to see the key points of the entire course. The concept maps took the form of trees, with topics branching up from two broad topic areas at the bottom: dynamics of particles and dynamics of rigid bodies. The entire tree was climbed up as the course progressed. The students were asked to build their own concept map at the end of the semester with the goal of stimulating creativity as delineated by constructivism in contemporary pedagogy. A survey was carried out at the end of the course to study student perceptions of using the concept map. While students expressed different opinions on several questions, 100% of the participant students responded “I agree” to the survey item “The concept map was a useful resource for in-class activities”. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the impact of years of experience and field of expertise on the development of chemistry knowledge structures from STEM experts comprising 103 professors, 10 postdocs, and 146 doctoral students. Of these participants, 127 were specialized in chemistry and the rest were from various science and engineering disciplines. Although most participants were part of a research university located in Northern California, the pool included a small group of experts from different universities and countries. The main source of the data was a Word Association Test generated with 17 keywords that refer to major topics or concepts commonly introduced in the general chemistry curricula. The knowledge structures were examined to determine if the contents and the orientations of the clusters varied between the expert groups. In addition, their analysis was enriched with the consideration of chemistry triplet designations and central terms identified by eccentricity values on each structure. The overall expert knowledge structure generated in this study was also compared to undergraduate structures determined by using the same instrument and methodology. The investigation of the structures revealed several differences between expert groups and provided insight into the transformation of novices into experts. The paper also presents practical suggestions for educators on how to utilize structures while teaching, informing their instructional practices, and reforming teaching materials. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study explores whether learning approaches combining augmented reality and multidimensional concept maps (ARMCMs) would improve learning effectiveness, learning motivation, learning satisfaction, and cognitive load more than multidimensional concept maps (MCMs) and augmented reality (AR) learning do. The study employed a quasi-experimental design, and the subjects were 93 students from an elementary school in Taiwan. By dividing the students into ARMCMs group, MCMs group, and AR group, the results show that the learning with ARMCMs can provide better promotion on learning motivation and positive influences on learning effectiveness, learning satisfaction, and cognitive load. © 2021, De La Salle University.

AB  - Objective: To combine machine efficiency and human intelligence for converting complex clinical trial eligibility criteria text into cohort queries. Materials and Methods: Criteria2Query (C2Q) 2.0 was developed to enable real-Time user intervention for criteria selection and simplification, parsing error correction, and concept mapping. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of enhanced modules for negation scope detection, temporal and value normalization were evaluated using a previously curated gold standard, the annotated eligibility criteria of 1010 COVID-19 clinical trials. The usability and usefulness were evaluated by 10 research coordinators in a task-oriented usability evaluation using 5 Alzheimer's disease trials. Data were collected by user interaction logging, a demographic questionnaire, the Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Scale (Health-ITUES), and a feature-specific questionnaire. Results: The accuracies of negation scope detection, temporal and value normalization were 0.924, 0.916, and 0.966, respectively. C2Q 2.0 achieved a moderate usability score (3.84 out of 5) and a high learnability score (4.54 out of 5). On average, 9.9 modifications were made for a clinical study. Experienced researchers made more modifications than novice researchers. The most frequent modification was deletion (5.35 per study). Furthermore, the evaluators favored cohort queries resulting from modifications (score 4.1 out of 5) and the user engagement features (score 4.3 out of 5). Discussion and Conclusion: Features to engage domain experts and to overcome the limitations in automated machine output are shown to be useful and user-friendly. We concluded that human-computer collaboration is key to improving the adoption and user-friendliness of natural language processing. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Each clinical encounter demands competent clinical skills and expertise from a student nurse. This period also becomes the most challenging as many have trouble linking theory with practice. Thus, they experience less confidence at the bedside of patients. Delivering high-quality, safe nursing care at the bedside requires sound clinical judgement. Nurses with clinical judgement have evidence-based knowledge enabling them to identify intuitively and quickly the salient patient care information and respond accordingly. Developing these critical clinical judgement abilities takes time, and many new nurses lack them. Concept mapping is a robust instructional technique that may assist a novice nurse in making links between many aspects of nursing care concepts, allowing for the development of clinical judgement. A concept map is a visual resource that organises and displays a student’s understanding of the links between distinct concepts for a particular subject. Most of the earlier studies were done in the simulation lab. Little evidence exists to claim that clinical judgement has improved over time due to applying concept mapping techniques in the clinical setting. This study aimed to determine the usefulness of the concept mapping approach to foster clinical judgement among nursing students in Bangalore, India. A quantitative, quasi-experimental pretest-post-test design with a control group was implemented among Bachelor of Science in Nursing students. The subjects were undergoing medical-surgical nursing courses in four nursing colleges in an urban setting. The allocation of four colleges to the control and experimental group was random. A sample size of 300 participants completed a questionnaire on baseline characteristics and the Lasater Clinical Judgement Rubric. The experimental group was taught using the concept mapping technique, and participants prepared a concept map for their assigned patient in the clinical area. The intervention group’s mean pretest clinical judgement score was 18.24 (SD = 3.17), while the control group’s was 20.18 (SD = 4.85). The intervention group’s mean post-test clinical judgement score (29.56, SD = 5.42) is greater than the control group’s (22.33, SD = 4.63). The experimental group had a substantially higher post-test clinical judgement score (t = 3.99, P<0.001) than the control group. The findings imply that concept mapping will help nursing students improve their clinical judgement abilities. © Unisa Press 2022.

AB  - Past studies have found mixed results of the impact of immersive virtual reality (IVR) environments on students' learning. In this study, we examined the effect of using concept maps, a kind of advance organizer, on students' learning of science via IVR. In this exploratory and immersive learning environment, we also explored the roles played by learners' epistemic curiosity and other affective factors. Seventy-four sixth-grade students participated in this research and were randomly assigned to the advance organizer group (AO; experimental group) and the non-advance organizer group (NAO; control group). Data collection included survey questionnaires and a science test for assessing students' understanding of plants. We examined the structural relationships among students’ curiosity and affective factors (including presence, control and active learning, positive emotional engagement, and negative emotional engagement), and compared the learning outcomes of the experimental and control groups. We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) for the data analysis. The results showed that students in the AO group had significantly higher scores for science concepts than those in the NAO group. In both groups, the interest-type curiosity and control and active learning positively predicted emotional engagement. Moreover, in the AO group, positive emotional engagement positively predicted the scientific knowledge of plant concepts. Implications for future research and instructional design are suggested in the study. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presents a qualitative study conducted using the Glaserian grounded theory (GT) method. Glaser’s approach to GT differs from Strauss and Corbin’s method, which is more widespread. There are some differences in the focus on participants’ concerns, staying in the research environment for an extended period to discover participants’ main concerns and the emergence of a basic social process around the core category. The Glaserian GT method was used to understand elite athletes’ lifestyles. Two groups of athletes and non-athletes were recruited for the interview as the sample. The core category was determined through iterative coding, memoing, theoretical sampling, and theoretical sorting. There were overlaps in these phases; they fluctuated back and forth and were not as clear-cut as they could be. Results showed the lifestyle components of elite athletes. Besides identifying participants’ main concerns, the results also demonstrated how to address them over time. It is a category of a basic social process named “professionalizing.” Lastly, the steps of creating a concept map are explained practically, which in addition to sports science scholars, can be considered by researchers in other fields. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate and report on the impact of an in-school science outreach program on children’s self-reported science knowledge, engagement, and skills through a case study of the Science North in-school outreach program “Mission to Mars.” A logic model method was used to outline the specific inputs, outputs, and measurable outcomes of the program. The program outcomes evaluated in this study were (1) experimentation skills, (2) critical thinking skills, and (3) sense of wonder. Results from pre-post surveys demonstrated that participants had increased program topic knowledge. Students self-reported positive emotions toward science more frequently following exposure to the program. Students’ sense of wonder toward science and toward space also increased post-program. This increase in positive emotion toward science could, in the short-term, increase student motivation toward science, which could lead to lasting interests in science in the long-term. Only a small number of students reported an increase in experimentation and critical thinking skills post-program. These skills take time to develop, and the single short-term program evaluated in this study may not have given students enough exposure to these skills for them to experience and show a noticeable change. The results of this study can provide informal science institutions like science centers with important insights into the potential learning impact of their in-school outreach programs, and can be used to improve current and future programs. Other organizations with in-school science outreach programs can benefit from using the methodology in this study to evaluate their programs, as this research includes a combination of innovative data collection methods such as concept maps to determine what students associate with the word “science,” and the use of an emoji scale to capture student emotions toward science. From a larger perspective, this study evaluating the impacts of in-school science outreach could demonstrate the potential benefits and outcomes of this unique area of informal learning, further solidifying the importance of incorporating these inquiry-based programs into classrooms.

AB  - Introduction UK higher education (HE) student numbers are increasing and students report higher levels of mental health and well-being issues. Social prescribing links individuals to community-based, non-medical support. It is widely implemented throughout the UK, and is supported by the Welsh Government. This protocol presents an evaluation of a new social prescribing service to enhance student well-being, a first for UK HE students. Methods and analysis A realist evaluation to articulate why, how and to what extent and circumstances social prescribing works for students, using a mixed-methods sequential design of four cycles. Cycle 1 informs the model and programme theory development of how the model works; activities include a Realist Review, Group Concept Mapping and producing bilingual short films about the evaluation and model. Cycle 2 involves secondary analysis of routine service data, and outcome measurements from students receiving a social prescription. Cycle 3 uses reflective diaries and qualitative realist interviews with stakeholders to understand the process and outcome of the model. Cycle 4 concludes with a world café workshop with stakeholders to agree and finalise the framework specification of € how, why, when and to what extent' the model works. A meta-matrix construction will determine convergence, complementarity or discrepancy across the cycles. An advisory group of key stakeholders informs each cycle. Ethics and dissemination University of South Wales Life Sciences and Education Ethics Committee and Wrexham Glyndwr University (WGU) Research Ethics Sub-Committee approved secondary data analysis of participant demographics (200 805LRL:USW, id441:WGU), outcome measurement tools (200 902LR:USW, id441:WGU) and qualitative data collection (200 804LR:USW, id449:WGU).

AB  - The methodological work in the year group constitutes the strategic process of planning, organizing, directing and controlling the educational teaching process to achieve continuous improvement and the satisfaction of the interested parties. In the groups of academic years, the main teachers of the year (highest authority) have the need to manage them through the process approach to take advantage of this with respect to the current functional approach that is presented in Higher Education. The research aims to analyze the methodological work in groups of academic years with a process approach. For this, a conceptual analysis of the methodological work is carried out and it is designed through the process map, the deployment and the flow diagram. Empirical methods such as observation, interviews and surveys were also used. During the development of the research, different softwares were used, among which are: Statistic Program for Social Sciences (SPSS) for the processing of surveys, UCINET in the analysis of social networks and MindManager X5 in the elaboration of concept maps. © 2022, University of Cienfuegos, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.

AB  - This research used Novakian concept mapping and interview techniques to track changes in knowledge and understanding amongst students and their supervisors in the course of full-time research towards a laboratory science-based PhD. This detailed longitudinal case study analysis measures both cognitive change in the specific subjects that are the topic for research, and the understanding of the process of PhD level research and supervision. The data show the challenges for students and supervisors from different national, ethnic, cultural, and academic backgrounds and traditions with a focus on how this impacts the PhD research process and development. Working cross-culturally, and often in a setting different from either the student or the supervisor’s background and training, can lead to a lack of common language and understanding for the development of a pedagogically oriented supervisory relationship. Documenting change in knowledge and understanding among PhD students and their supervisors is key to surfacing what the joint processes of mutual democratic research and of supervision may entail. This study explores how one of these key processes is a student’s developing sense of belonging (or non-belonging). Specifically, this paper engages the concepts of belonging, and democratic education through mutual learning, to explore the practices of working across national, cultural, ethnic, and diverse academic backgrounds, for both supervisors and students. Doctoral study is understood as a situated context in which belonging also acts as a gateway for who can join the global scientific community. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Online learning has been widely discussed in education research, and open educational resources have become an increasingly popular way to help learners acquire knowledge. However, these resources contain massive amounts of information, making it difficult for learners to identify Web articles that refer to computer science knowledge. This study developed an Internet articles retrieval agent combined with dynamic associative concept maps (DACMs). The system used text mining technology to analyze keywords to filter computer science articles. In previous research, concept maps were manually constructed; in this study, such maps can be automatically and dynamically generated in real time. In a case study of a fundamental course of artificial intelligence, this study designed two experiments to compare students’ learning behaviors while using this system and the Google search engine. The results of the first experiment showed that the experimental group searched for more knowledge articles on computer science using this agent, compared to the control group using the Google search engine. The learning performance of the experimental group was significantly better than that of the control group, while the cognitive load of the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group. Furthermore, the results of the second experiment showed that the learning progress of students using the agent was significantly greater than that of students who used the Google search engine. This illustrates that the agent effectively filtered computer science articles, and DACMs helped students gain a deeper understanding of academic concepts and knowledge related to artificial intelligence. © 2022

AB  - This research study investigated conceptions about buoyancy held by 55 elementary preservice teachers enrolled in a science methods course who participated in an instructional intervention designed to increase their knowledge about buoyancy. Pre- and post-concept maps were analyzed using a paired sample t test and thematic analysis was used to interpret narratives, drawings, and interview data. There was a statistically significant difference (t = −3.504, p =.001) in the total number of scientifically correct concepts for the pre-concept maps (M = 0.51, SD =.879) and post-concept maps (M = 1.25, SD = 1.542). The total number of accurate propositions increased between the pre- and post-concept maps. The drawings revealed that most participants (66%) had alternative conceptions about how gravity is related to buoyancy and the role it plays in floating and sinking. Data from the interviews triangulated with other data sources that showed gains in scientific conceptions such as opposing forces (53%) and surface area (33%), while documenting the persistence of serious alternative conceptions about floating and sinking (49%), the key role of fluid density (56%), and density of an object (62%). © 2021, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.

AB  - The general development of knowledge in physics particulary, requires the ability to understand the right and obey the principles. This study purposed to carried out the use of learning models to ensure a quality learning process with the right concepts and avoid misconceptions. The learning model is also adaptive to the 4.0 era demands and the special situation of the pandemic era. The learning model is PIMCA (presentation-idea mapping-conceptualization-assessment formative). The PIMCA learning model is based on the main theories of educational psychology, such as behavioristic, cognitive, constructivist, and humanistic. It was conducted to students in the physics education department at Manado State University, used experimental study in various fields of physics studies such as waves, optics, electricity, and magnetism, it was found that the average achievement of learning progress from the pre-test and post-test was 73.14%. Likewise, in terms of conceptual understanding of physics, namely from idea maps and concept maps, an average increase of up to 84% is obtained. The major findings of this study indicate that the PIMCA learning model can be effectively used as an alternative in learning physics. Study using PIMCA learning models needs to be continued to be applied to the learning of physics in the field of mechanics and modern physics, as well as in the learning of mathematics, science, including biology-chemistry-geology and astronomy, and engineering. © 2022 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd

AB  - Science-art residencies can provide opportunities for insightful cross-disciplinary collaborations, science communication, and engagement with the general public. Currently, there are few formal ways for artists and scientists to collaborate in Canada, and even fewer publications on how these experiences can impact learning in informal settings. Art the Science (a Canadian non-profit organization facilitating cross-disciplinary relationships between artists and scientists) piloted a comprehensive multiphase science-art residency program. Phase 1 informed the artist’s work through a full-time experience in a scientific laboratory at an academic institution, Phase 2 showcased the artist’s final artwork, Between the Sand at an off-campus local community event, and Phase 3 published an interactive online version of the work for global exhibition. Residency evaluation in each phase was conducted through the use of qualitative and quantitative methods, including interviews, concept mapping, video diaries, and surveys. The artist, scientist and lab members gained new perspectives and inspiration about their respective fields. The artist was able to incorporate theories and processes from the research group into their artistic practice. On the other hand, the scientist saw renewed enthusiasm and curiosity within their research lab, and the lab members reported new ways of thinking about how to communicate their research. Both exhibitions proved to be engaging informal learning experiences for 66.2% of survey participants, and revealed several major learning themes. Despite promoting both events as artwork exhibitions, 79.2% of survey participants considered Between the Sand as both an artwork and a science communication product suggesting that science-based art may have the potential to communicate science, even when it is not presented as a science communication effort. Public responses revealed that public perception of funding is not skewed to either discipline and instead seems to call upon both science and arts grants to fund such interdisciplinary initiatives. Providing comprehensive artist residencies in science labs may have a valuable impact on everyone involved: the artist, the research group, and the public. Copyright © 2022 Lau, Barriault and Krolik.

AB  - The work analyzes the theoretical guidelines of the Flipped Classroom methodology and presents as its objective the proposal of a methodology. A mixed investigation is proposed, based on the theoretical review of works that have contributed to its development, the use of analysis-synthesis methods; induction-deduction and a conceptual map is obtained that summarizes a proposal for its application and a set of characteristics that systematize its advantages and limitations. It is applied to an experimental group and it is compared with a control group in the Natural Science subject of fourth grade at the Guillermo Arosemena Colonel school. In the experimental group, the acquisition of competences by the students stands out, such as: autonomy, ability to learn to learn and development of teamwork with the application of the Spearman Correlation test; as well as better results in the teaching-learning process. Similarly, a survey is applied to the parents, proven to be reliable and valid, which allows the use of the Iadov test and the Net Promoter Score with results that show satisfaction, feasibility of application and willingness to recommend. © 2022, University of Cienfuegos, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.

AB  - Concept maps have emerged as an essential tool for illustrating the mutual relationships between knowledge in the domain. It provides guidance and suggestions in many educational applications such as optimal study order generating, curriculum design and course evaluation. However, there are no consistent datasets for concept map research. In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive dataset for learning concept maps. Specifically, we collect 1292 undergraduate courses in Information Technology (IT) and Computer Science (CS) from 14 Australian universities including course ID, category and prerequisite requirements. Besides, we analyze the semantic properties based on the concepts retrieved from the course description and visualize them to illustrate how our dataset could be used. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset containing course information from Australian universities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - With the development of science and technology, the demand for programmers has increased. However, learning computer programs is not an easy task. It might cause a significant impact on programming if misconceptions exist at the beginning of the study. Hence, it is important to discover and correct them immediately. Chatbots are effective teaching aids, they can assist students in eliminating misconceptions. They also assist teachers to instruct students according to their aptitude, which teachers found it hard to accomplish without technical supports when teaching in large classes. Therefore, this experiment uses chatbots to assist learners in the correction phase. We consider that learners who failed unit quizzes might have misunderstandings in programming concepts. We believe chatbots can teach according to individual misunderstandings and give correct responses to their unclear concepts. It is more effective than traditional teaching methods. In addition, to prevent human-computer interaction barriers, such as picking wrong keywords and giving plausible replies, or learners not being able to express their problems clearly, this experiment also adds concept maps to the chatbots’ dialogue, to work as the dialogue structure for each chatbot. The maps help the chatbots to explain concepts in each unit systematically and logically. The chatbots give questions according to the concepts on the concept maps and ask learners to reply with their answers. An ANCOVA test investigated students’ scores. Result showed the p-value is below 0.001, indicating that the group using concept map chatbots has better correction effects than the other group using only concept maps. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Big Data pervades nearly all areas of life sciences, yet the analysis of large integrated data sets remains a major challenge. Moreover, the field of life sciences is highly fragmented and, consequently, so is its data, knowledge, and standards. This, in turn, makes integrated data analysis and knowledge gathering across sub-fields a demanding task. At the same time, the integration of various research angles and data types is crucial for modelling the complexity of organisms and biological processes in a holistic manner. This is especially valid in the context of drug development and chemical safety assessment where computational methods can provide solutions for the urgent need of fast, effective, and sustainable approaches. At the same time, such computational methods require the development of methodologies suitable for an integrated and data centred Big Data view. Here we discuss Knowledge Graphs (KG) as a solution to a data centred analysis approach for drug and chemical development and safety assessment. KGs are knowledge bases, data analysis engines, and knowledge discovery systems all in one, allowing them to be used from simple data retrieval, over meta-analysis to complex predictive and knowledge discovery systems. Therefore, KGs have immense potential to advance the data centred approach, the re-usability, and informativity of data. Furthermore, they can improve the power of analysis, and the complexity of modelled processes, all while providing knowledge in a natively human understandable network data model. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Internalizing the process and methods of scientific research is fundamental both for young people who are getting prepared to work as scientific researchers, as well as for those who participate in social discourses on scientific issues as responsible citizens. In addition, many current problems can not only be solved from a specialist perspective; interdisciplinary cooperation plays an important role in research and society. It is therefore important that teachers know teaching concepts that enable students to acquire competencies to be prepared for these challenges in life. To implement this, a new pre-service teacher study curriculum was developed as part of the MINTplus2 (engl. STEMplus2) project at TU Darmstadt, which conveys interdisciplinary teaching approaches, especially about STEM. As a part of this project, we developed a new seminar which focusses especially on didactic concepts like inquiry-based learning in order to prepare pre-service science teachers to convey their students the methodological knowledge of the scientific research process. This paper shows the seminar structure embedded in the whole project and the first evaluation results with n=14 concept maps of seven students that show that there is a measurable increase in knowledge regarding the seminar topic. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Research into students' conceptions is inherently challenged with appropriately transferring profound research questions into suitable research instruments. This applies in particular, but not exclusively, to studies with primary school students. In order to investigate individuals' conceptions, besides linear-linguistic questionnaire procedures, classically guided interviews are used, also triangulated with each other or further sub-instruments (e.g. concept mapping techniques). For this latter purpose, seek-and-find-drawings offer a good opportunity, both paper based and digital. This paper presents research on primary school students' conceptions of computers in everyday objects and illustrates a methodical opportunity regarding the use of seek-and-find-drawings in Computer Science Education research. In the presented study, 60 primary school children were presented with a seek-and-find-drawing depicting several everyday encounter situations with computing systems. According to the results, primary school students understand not only personal computers, smartphones, tablets, video gaming consoles and (video) cameras, but in few cases also refrigerators, air conditioners and cars as systems containing (embedded) computers. The experience from the presented paper based hidden objects study can be used especially for future research projects. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Environmental sustainability is important to public health and of particular significance considering the rapidly growing ageing population. While advancement in chemical science has contributed to enhanced quality of life, increasing levels of chemical pollutions and the impact of chemicals on human health and the environment have led to serious concern. The deterioration of environmental quality has been largely due to chemical pollution and the elderly group in the population are more susceptible to the hazardous effects of industrial chemicals and airborne pollutants. This situation also presents uphill challenges to the promotion of healthy ageing which requires a sustainable clean environment, contributed through the advancement of sustainable and green chemistry. However, innovations in gree n chemistry require a systems thinking mindset which is also important in realizing the impact of chemicals on human health and the environment. The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the United Nations has called for immediate actions in adopting the SDGs as a central concern in the reform of different domains for the invention of a sustainable future. The practice of chemistry has various impacts on many interconnected systems, re-orientation of chemistry education has been proposed with the implementation of inter-disciplinary approaches as informed by systems thinking, with a growing number of reports suggesting its potentials and applications in chemical education. Despite the vast opinions suggesting the promising prospects of appl ying systems thinking in education, reports on the development of relevant tools and educational resources are only of a limited amount, with recent perspectives identifying the design of educational tools and resources as one of the priority areas. In thi s study, we report the collaborative work across the disciplines of health and chemical sciences in the pedagogic design of incorporating systems thinking in chemistry education adopting the theoretical framework. The design of a system-oriented concept map extension (SOCME) diagram is described, with reference to a case study of chemicals released from the degradation of plastics. The work presented illustrates the potential of systems thinking in sustainable education and adds to the collections of educat ional resources for incorporation of systems thinking in teaching and learning. © 2022 Australasian College of Health Service Management.

AB  - STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education is attracting increasing attention, but how to improve students’ STEM learning achievement is still a big challenge. In the process of learning, students actively set learning goals, organize learning content, set learning standards, and independently adapt learning strategies and monitoring measures in order to achieve their own learning goals and to help them learn STEM knowledge and skills. Concept mapping is considered to be an effective visualized knowledge organizing tool that helps students to manage and organize their knowledge systematically and visually. This study proposes a concept mapping-based self-regulated learning approach. A quasi-experiment was conducted using a concept mapping-based self-regulated learning system in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improved students’ STEM skills, but not their STEM knowledge compared to the conventional self-regulated learning approach. The proposed learning approach helped to improve students’ self-regulation compared to the conventional self-regulation learning approach. In short, the concept mapping-based self-regulation learning approach enhances students’ self-efficacy and self-regulation, which in turn helps students to learn STEM skills effectively. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Contemporary early childhood research investigates ways of extending children’s scientific understanding and knowing in the world around them. The current study followed an innovative approach, adopting the design thinking model of IDEO to promote and deepen children’s scientific thinking and understanding of the ‘water cycle’. Digital technologies such as concept map software, simulations, interactive whiteboard and others, were also successfully integrated and played a significant role in the whole process. A total of 61 children from three Greek kindergartens participated in the study (33 boys and 28 girls) and their mean age was 5.2 years. Teachers’ diaries of the activities following the IDEO phases, digital recordings of children’s responses, drawings and concept maps were utilised for the documentation of the teaching intervention. The results revealed that the IDEO model was very helpful and contributed to reaching positive learning outcomes. Children were active participants throughout the intervention and their scientific knowledge was enhanced. Future research with a design thinking framework in exploring science in early childhood education settings is strongly recommended by also successfully integrating digital tools. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Concept mapping (CM) is widely used in educational settings as a teaching/learning or assessment tool. We conducted a bibliometric analysis and systematic review to provide an updated review on CM research in computer-supported learning environments. A total of 356 selected studies published from 1990 to 2020 were analyzed from the Web of Science database. The findings revealed an increasing and continuous focus on CM research. The leading journal for publishing CM research was Computers & Education, and the United States was the country with the most published studies. The most frequently used keywords were categorized into four clusters to represent the four main themes of CM research. Subsequent analysis showed that the most applied learning subject was environmental science or natural science; traditional computers/devices were the most used devices/hardware; higher education students were the most used samples; quantitative methods were the most used research methods; computers as mindtools were the most adopted learning strategy; and concept mapping assessment was the most used measurement tool in the CM research. These findings reveal the trends of CM research and provide future research directions and applications of practical education for researchers and educators. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The intervention study presented in this paper explored pre-service science teachers’ (PSSTs) understanding of scientific inquiry (SI) and scientific practices (SPs) during a laboratory application in science education course. Thirty-nine secondary school PSSTs, who study in the Science Education Department in a public university in Turkey, enrolled in a 14-week-long course and volunteered to participate in the study. The participants were exposed to a method is called the 4-phase implementation that includes laboratory-based inquiry activities addressing SI and SPs and they completed microteaching presentations. Their understanding of SI and SPs was examined through the course period. The main data sources included Views about Scientific Inquiry (VASI) Instrument and concept maps were used to track the changes in these understandings. The findings indicated that PSSTs had inadequate understanding of inquiry on some aspects even after the treatment. Yet, the method had positive impact in PSSTs’ understanding inquiry especially in terms of facilitating the comprehension that scientific investigations begin with questions, there is no single method in investigations, and explanations are derived from collected data. The concept maps created by some of the participants also supported these results and revealed a more coherent and holistic understanding of SPs by integrating both epistemic and social components into their maps. However, PSSTs did not seem to have totally understood other aspects of inquiry including the inquiry procedures, the research conclusions, and the difference between data and evidence. Further implications are critically discussed in terms of designing future laboratory applications for science education courses. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This study investigates the roles, applications, and trends of concept map-supported education (CMSE) by reviewing the studies published from 1992 to 2020. Several dimensions, such as the media of concept maps, roles of concepts, sample groups, research methods, application domains, learning contexts, research foci, as well as the citation and co-citation relationships, are taken into account based on the technology-based learning model. From the review results, two thematic clusters were found, namely concept map-facilitated knowledge construction in collaborative learning, and concept map-based learning design to improve learning achievement and motivation. The research focused more on the applications in engineering courses, followed by science and language courses, and potential was also found in arts, business or management, and mathematics. Learning contexts for CMSE are mainly in-class activities, followed by online discussion activities; moreover, it was found that the number of applications in digital game-based learning contexts is increasing. In terms of research foci, more studies investigated learners’ performance, attitude/motivation, and perceptions, while less emphasis was put on developing learners’ skills, higher order thinking, as well as collaboration and communication competences. Accordingly, several suggestions for future research of CMSE are provided as a reference for researchers and policy makers. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Apart from helping students to acquire meaningful learning, concept mapping might promote in them word-recognition skills for the identification and management of relevant information within foreign language (L2) texts. Hence, this article inquires into the influence of concept maps and graphic organisers as tools for noun category identification from L2 texts. Research sample comprises sixty Spanish primary education students from a bilingual school. Design is quasi-experimental, and the training programme lasted three weeks. Materials used during the training period are not exceptional, but the ordinarily found in regular classrooms. Data gathering procedure consists of the identification and circling of nouns by sample participants. As a starting point, secondary data as the intelligent quotient, learning style, and English level is collected via standardised tests. The analysis of the variance showed a highly significant interaction between the groups and the implemented texts both for noun identification (F 3.171= 12.124, p &lt; 0.000, η 2= 0.175), and the grammatical categories mistakenly identified as nouns (F 3.171= 3.840, p &lt; 0.016, η 2= 0.063). © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - As educators around the world are exploring new approaches to keep students involved in remote learning during the pandemic, we investigated the utility of memes in promoting engagement in the online environment. Medical students enrolled in a human physiology course at the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Sohar, Oman were provided with an option to create memes related to the learning outcomes in renal physiology. One hundred forty-six of 280 students chose to create memes (52%), and the remaining students chose to submit either a labeled diagram or a concept map. Students uploaded their work in the discussion forum of the learning management system. All students enrolled in the course were given an opportunity for interaction with the uploaded content by commenting and upvoting thereafter. Students were requested to give anonymous feedback on their experience speciﬁcally on the activity related to memes. Feedback received from 142 of 280 students through anonymous comments was subjected to thematic analysis. Based on the analysis of the data, we found that memes elicited interest in the topic, facilitated peer interaction, simpliﬁed complex ideas, enhanced retention of associated concepts, and fostered a positive learning environment.

AB  - Humor is considered an educational method that can be implemented in educational processes with a wide range of educational variables. Examining the scope of research on educational humor has the potential to guide future studies. Therefore, the aim of this study is to show the conceptual trend in humor research in education over the past decade. 989 publications on the subject of humor in education were analyzed using the text mining method. A text analytic tool was used for the analysis, and the titles, abstracts, and keywords were included in the text analytics. As a result of the study, humor was studied in terms of various variables in different educational fields. In addition, the reflections of humor in education base on technological developments and the target groups applied were also revealed. The findings revealed the conceptual relationships and concept maps by year. It was concluded that the concept of humor in educational research is particularly related to the variables of motivation, attention, skill, creativity, engagement, and interest. Upon comparing 2010 and 2019, it has been observed that concepts related to online education, science, collaborative learning, and technology in humor studies have spread in recent years. In addition, humor has also emerged as a research phenomenon in language, health, and science education. © 2021, Ozgen Korkmaz. All rights reserved.

AB  - This experimental study aimed to replicate and extend a previous efficacy study of an elementary grade content literacy intervention that demonstrated positive effects on students’ vocabulary knowledge depth, argumentative writing, and reading comprehension. Using a cluster (school) randomized trial design, this replication experiment was conducted with 5,494 first- and second-grade students in 30 elementary schools in an urban school district located in the southeastern USA. Teachers implemented thematic lessons (20 lessons) that provided an intellectual framework for helping students who acquire networks of related vocabulary knowledge while learning science and social studies content. Teachers integrated thematic lessons, concept mapping, and interactive read-alouds of conceptually related informational texts to enable their students to build networks of vocabulary knowledge and to transfer this knowledge to argumentative writing and collaborative research activities. Confirmatory analyses replicated positive findings on science vocabulary knowledge depth (ES = 0.50) and argumentative writing (ES = 0.24) and also extended positive findings to social studies vocabulary knowledge depth (ES = 0.56) and argumentative writing (ES = 0.44). Positive and statistically significant findings were not replicated on domain-general reading comprehension. Exploratory analyses indicated that students’ vocabulary knowledge depth partially mediated the impact of content literacy instruction on domain-specific argumentative writing outcomes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Magnetic lubricants are usually petroleum-based, but not renewable and cannot be environmentally degraded. It can cause the environmental problems. Magnetic lubricants based on ionic liquids can be environmental friendly. The ionic liquid lubricants are synthesized from vegetable oil fatty acids, which is a locally sustainable and renewable sources. This molecular engineering can be used to integrate the concept of sustainability into teaching and learning. This study aimed to obtain the concept map and teaching learning sequence (TLS) from the scientist's conception. The method used is a qualitative content analysis (literature analysis type), using an instrument in the form of a content analysis format. The first phase begins with collecting literatures in the form of textbooks, monographs, review results and research articles. The next phase is descriptive analysis, selecting categories, and evaluating the material didactically. This research produces the concept map, TLS and clarified chemical concepts. The scientist's conception obtained is the application, function, characteristics of media magnetic lubricants, ionic liquids and examples of magnetic lubricants based on ionic liquids. Concept map and TLS can illustrate the relationship between one concept and another. They also show the relationship between science, technology and engineering. The results can be used as the basis for the preparation of teaching materials and didactical designs for teaching and learning. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Concept maps are graphic learning tools that allow teachers and students to organize, represent knowledge, and visualize the relationships between concepts to promote understanding of physics. This study describes an innovative experience based on the development of concept maps with the aim of analyzing the perception of students in a teacher training program in natural sciences and environmental education at a public university in Colombia. The research subjects were 24 students studying basic physics who used concept maps for learning, and the data were analyzed quantitatively using a non-experimental design. The results show that the trainee teachers learned to elaborate concept maps, valuing very positively their educational applications to improve learning. It is concluded that concept mapping can be used to increase students' understanding and motivation which should help to improve their academic performance. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - When students in programming courses are taught event-driven programming (EDP) for the first time, they face new terminology and concepts that they should internalize. Moreover, they learn a fully new approach for reasoning about program logic and execution order. However, there is a lack of research in students' understanding of these concepts. In this paper, we describe a study, in which we asked web development students to explain their conception of EDP: what are the main concepts involved and how they interact. Moreover, we asked them to explain the execution of a short piece of JavaScript code that focuses on basic usage of events and event listeners. The answers, which we requested as concept maps and text, were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Our results clearly demonstrate shortcomings in the students' learning and illustrate various misunderstandings that they may have regarding EDP. Based on the findings, we give suggestions for improving the teaching of EDP. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Introduction Mechanisms explain how implementation strategies work. Implementation research requires careful operationalisation and empirical study of the causal pathway(s) by which strategies effect change, and factors that may amplify or weaken their effects. Understanding mechanisms is critically important to replicate findings, learn from negative studies or adapt an implementation strategy developed in one setting to another. Without understanding implementation mechanisms, it is difficult to design strategies to produce expected effects across contexts, which may have disproportionate effects on settings in which priority populations receive care. This manuscript outlines the protocol for an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality-funded initiative to: (1) establish priorities for an agenda to guide research on implementation mechanisms in health and public health, and (2) disseminate the agenda to research, policy and practice audiences. Methods and analysis A network of scientific experts will convene in 'Deep Dive' meetings across 3 years. A research agenda will be generated through analysis and synthesis of information from six sources: (1) systematic reviews, (2) network members' approaches to studying mechanisms, (3) new proposals presented in implementation proposal feedback sessions, (4) working group sessions conducted in a leading implementation research training institute, (5) breakout sessions at the Society for Implementation Research Collaboration's (SIRC) 2019 conference and (6) SIRC conference abstracts. Two members will extract mechanism-relevant text segments from each data source and a third member will generate statements as an input for concept mapping. Concept mapping will generate unique clusters of challenges, and the network will engage in a nominal group process to identify priorities for the research agenda. Ethics and dissemination This initiative will yield an actionable research agenda to guide research to identify and test mechanisms of change for implementation strategies. The agenda will be disseminated via multiple channels to solicit feedback and promote rigorous research on implementation mechanisms. © 2021 Author(s). Published by BMJ.

AB  - This study developed and validated an assessment that measures interdisciplinary understanding using the topic of carbon cycling, the Interdisciplinary Science Assessment for Carbon Cycling (ISACC). This work was motivated by the need to assess interdisciplinary understanding, defined as the ability to solve problems requiring knowledge and skills from multiple disciplines. Levels of a construct map for interdisciplinary understanding were generated and refined in the construct-modeling design process (Wilson 2005). Key concepts in carbon cycling to be assessed were determined based on experts’ concept maps and analysis of the Next Generation Science Standards. The final version of the ISACC includes 11 multiple-choice (MC) items and eight constructed-response (CR) items covering nine key concepts. Of these 19 items, six are single-disciplinary items and 13 are interdisciplinary items. Four hundred fifty-four students in grades 9–16 were recruited and administered the ISACC. For the CR items, scoring rubrics were developed and used by a group of evaluators to code student responses. Two item response theory models, a two-parameter logistic model and a generalized partial credit model, provided evidence of the construct validity of the items. All items reflected unidimensionality and local independence and showed moderate internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.782). All except one were a good fit to the models. The findings suggest that the ISACC is a promising tool to assess interdisciplinary understanding of carbon cycling. Future directions include research into test fairness across gender and ethnic/racial groups and further development to cover typical high school students’ knowledge more thoroughly. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are pivotal actors in international affairs. They manage billions of dollars in funding, work all around the world, and shape global policies and standards. It thus comes as no surprise that the subject of accountability has drawn the interest of an increasing number of scholars across disciplines. Though there seems to be agreement about its desirability, accountability is also described as chameleon-like and ambiguous. And despite calls for more cross-disciplinary learning and conceptual clarity, there does not exist a comprehensive review of accountability conceptualizations across and within disciplines, or how the different meanings relate to each other. Based on the conceptual review of 217 research articles published within the last twenty years, this study identifies and analyzes conceptualizations of accountability in the major journals of five engaged disciplines: accounting, development studies, international relations and political science, organization studies and management, and public administration. Integrating this broad scholarship reveals that: (1) there exist 113 different conceptualizations of accountability, 90 of which are rarely used and appear in less than 5 percent of all analyzed articles, (2) scholars have used forty-three different conceptualizations in 2019 compared to seventeen conceptualizations in 2009, (3) many conceptualizations refer to same phenomena by different name (duplication), and different phenomena by the same name (conflict), and that (4) conceptual ambiguity contributes to ambiguity among the forty different terms used to measure and operationalize accountability. These findings illustrate a lack of cross-disciplinary learning and accumulation of knowledge, and suggest that new conceptualizations be introduced only if one or more of the 113 existing ones don't already capture an idea sufficiently. The purpose of this article is to serve as a concept map for scholars when debating and charting new directions for the study of accountability. © 2021 The Author(s) (2021).

AB  - The implementation of systems approaches and systems thinking has been considered as an important parameter for reforming chemistry education and practice. The “Systemic Approach to Teaching and Learning (SATL)” strategy is a teaching-learning approach which is based on the development and use of cyclic concept mapping procedures, known as systemics, for teaching as well as for students’ assessment, known as SAQs. The SATL strategy focuses on the enhancement of students’ systems thinking skills, which are believed to enhance their understanding of relevant science concepts. The aims of this study were: (a) To investigate the effect of the implementation of the SATL strategy on 11th grade students’ deep understanding of chemistry concepts, and (b) to explore the relationship between students’ understanding in chemistry and the development of basic systems thinking skills. For this purpose, an experimental group, taught by the SATL strategy, was compared with a control group taught by a traditional linear approach, regarding students’ chemistry understanding. For the intervention group, the relationship between students’ understanding and their systems thinking skills was also explored. The results indicated that chemistry understanding of students taught by the SATL strategy was significantly greater compared to that of students taught by a traditional linear approach. Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between students’ deep understanding of chemistry concepts and their systems thinking level. This research provides evidence for a possible relationship between chemistry deep understanding and the development of systems thinking skills. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Active inquiry plays a key role in science education. To facilitate children's motivation, alternate reality games are applied to engage children actively in inquiry in authentic learning contexts. However, the complexity of real-world contexts and the ambiguity of game puzzles increase the difficulty for children to conduct effective inquiries. To achieve successful inquiry-based learning, concept mapping is an effective learning strategy to guide children to organise related information as well as to brainstorm for possible solutions. Accordingly, this study proposes a mobile concept mapping-based questioning approach for environmental education. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the conventional questioning approach in game-based inquiry-based learning. The results showed that the proposed approach had a more significant effect on learning achievement, critical thinking, and learning attitude than the conventional questioning approach. However, cognitive overload negatively affected the children's learning. Besides, it was found that improper use of concept maps could limit their creative problem-solving performances. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Alternate reality game (ARG) significantly promotes children’s learning motivation and engagement of game-based inquiry learning activities. Most children have difficulties in learning with ARGs due to the complexity of real-world contexts and the ambiguity of the puzzles. Children cannot construct knowledge effectively without proper learning supports in their cognitive process; however, it is challenge to provide proper learning supports without distracting children from gaming. What this paper adds An ARG with a mobile concept mapping-based questioning approach (ARG-CMQ) was applied to facilitate meaningful inquiry-based learning for children in different real environments (school campuses and in science museums). Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were examined to identify the effect of different learning strategies to support children learning with ARGs. ARG-CMQ improved children’s learning achievement, critical thinking and learning attitude better than conventional ARGs. ARG-CMQ might limit children’s divergent thinking and influences their creative problem-solving performance. Implications for practice and/or policy ARG-CMQ is a potential approach for inquiry-based learning in real environments, especially in improving learning perceptions and higher-order cognitive abilities. ARG-CMQ can be used to support competency-based education. © 2021 British Educational Research Association

AB  - Aim: To develop a working definition of ‘clinical credibility’ in nursing science. Methods: This is stage 2 of a registered report. Concept mapping methodology, 1. Preparation, 2. Generation of statements (brainstorming), 3. Structuring of statements (prioritising/clustering), 4. Representation of statements, 5. Interpretation of maps and 6. Utilisation of maps were used. Part 1 of our registered report followed the required items on the SPIRIT 2013 checklist. Part 2 was reporting the results of our study adhered to the STROBE reporting guidelines. Results: Participants (n = 67) from three stakeholder groups participated in this study. Nursing students (n = 23), nurses and other healthcare professionals (n = 23), and patients (within the last 12 months) (n = 21). Participants (n = 62) generated statements (n = 429) in response to the question: ‘What does clinical credibility mean to you?’. Following statement reduction, participants (n = 61) prioritised and clustered (n = 80) statements. The data were analysed using the concept mapping software, Ariadne. A visual ‘concept map’ was produced showing the importance and relationship of each statement as viewed by all participants. The final concept map had nine clusters. In order of importance these are as follows: 1. Safe practice, 2. Communication, 3. Patient-centred care, 4. Accountable, 5. Professional practice, 6. Clinical competence, 7. Teaching attributes, 8. Contemporary expert and 9. Leadership. This study was undertaken over an eight-month period. Conclusion: Clinical credibility is not necessarily about contemporary clinical practice. It is a multidimensional construct of which current clinical practice is one element. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Aim: To develop a working definition of the concept of “clinical credibility” in nursing science. Background: In both academic and clinical settings, the phrase “clinical credibility” is used when discussing the education of health professionals. No clear definition for the concept is evident in the academic literature. To date, there has not been a study undertaken to develop a working definition of clinical credibility in nursing science. Methods: This protocol is stage 1 of a registered report. We will use concept mapping to compare and organise views of three stakeholder groups: nursing students (n = 20) from years 2 or 3 of a three-year Bachelor of Nursing Programme, nurses and other health professionals (n = 20) still practising within a clinical setting, and people who have recently been inpatients in hospital (n = 20). First, participants will take part in separate stakeholder focus groups to generate statements about “What is clinical credibility?”. Second, the same participants will complete two tasks: (1) rank the importance of each statement (prioritising) and (2) put the statements that appear to go together into groups (clustering). The data will then be analysed using a specialised software program called Ariadne. A visual “concept map” will be produced showing the importance and relationship of each statement as viewed by the participants. The projected timeline for the study is one year. The paper complies with the SPIRIT 2013 guidelines for study protocols adapted for mixed methods research. Conclusion: The findings of this study will provide a working definition of the concept of “clinical credibility” in nursing science. Relevance to clinical practice: The findings can be used to develop a measure of clinical credibility to predict student satisfaction and patient safety outcomes. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nowadays, providing access to the required information by clinical informationist (CI) is vital for clinical teams to make the best decision. This study was carried out to identifying how CIs should participate in grand round (GR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study is an action research study. It was conducted in the GR sessions of the Gastroenterology department of Al-Zahra Hospital affiliated with Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in 2017. Participants included attending physicians, fellowship students of the Gastroenterology departments, a CI, and two supervising medical librarians. Data were collected through observation and discussion. Qualitative content analysis and concept mapping were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The findings indicated that existing problems were related to the CI, medical team, and infrastructural ones. The participation of the CI in medical team was arranged based on the following steps: planning, action, evaluation, and suggestions. It started from an initial diagnosis of patients and ended in GR meetings. During evaluation step, suggestions were made to remove the existing problems and in the fifth step, results were summarized and a framework for the participation of the CI in GR sessions was suggested. CONCLUSIONS: Medical team members were satisfied with the participation of the CI, but it is necessary to remove the existing structural and personal barriers (related to the CI and medical team members), in order to improve the efficiency of this participation. © 2021 EDP Sciences.

AB  - Concept Mapping (CM) is a learning strategy to organize and understand complex rela-tionships, which are particularly characteristic of the natural science subjects. Previous research has already shown that constructing concept maps can promote students’ meaningful learning in terms of deeper knowledge and its more flexible use. While researchers generally agree that students need to practice using CM successfully for learning, key parameters of effective CM training (e.g., content, structure, and duration) remain controversial. This desideratum is taken up by our study, in which three different training approaches were evaluated: a CM training with scaffolding and feedback vs. a CM training without additional elements vs. a non-CM control training. In a quasi-experimental design, we assessed the learning outcome of N = 73 university students who each had participated in one of the trainings before. Our results suggest that an extensive CM training with scaffolding and feedback is most appropriate to promote both CM competence and acquisition of knowledge. From an educational perspective, it would therefore be advisable to accept the time-consuming process of intensive practice of CM in order to enable students to adequately use of the strategy and thus facilitate meaningful learning in terms of achieving sustained learning success. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Research on the physics learning of electric charge has been carried out using MR-SR (Multiple Representation and Semiotic Resources). The research aims to find out the outcomes of student learning using the PIMCA learning model (Presentation, Idea Mapping, Conceptualization, and Assessment formative) introduced and developed by Cosmas Poluakan. The research was conducted at the Department of Physics, Manado State University, with 22 pre-service teacher students as respondents using the One Group Pre-test-Post-test Design. The instruments used in the form of pre-test and post-test which have been tested and validated. The research implementation stage starts from the pre-test, and then the implementation of physics learning follows the 4 steps of the PIMCA model. The results of data processing and analysis obtained an average pre-test score is 18,88 and an average post-test score is 75,16. There was an increase in concept mastery. In the idea mapping stage only 2 concepts are correct to drafting concept mapping, 6 are correct from 10 concepts that were used as references. PIMCA MR-SR learning model is very effective in helping students find and understand the correct concepts of physics. The use of the PIMCA MR-SR as a new model in the teaching and learning process is very effective in learning physics, mathematics and science or in the STEM area. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - With the rapid development of mobile learning technologies as well as relevant hardware and software platforms, there is a bright prospect for mixed reality (MR) applying in the field of education. However, appropriate knowledge navigation and concept arrangement methods are urgent to diminish students' cognitive load in the virtual learning environment. In this preliminary study, concept maps were selected as scaffolding tools to help students navigate through the MR learning space, and an educational game prototype named MMRCM integrating MR and concept maps was developed to investigate students' technology acceptance about it. Considering the novelty of this new type of MR application, an extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was constructed with the MR game design elements and the concept map usefulness as external factors. A middle school physics experiment using MMRCM was conducted to help students learn the abstract concepts of friction. The evaluation results showed that the model's external factors have significant correlations with both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The findings indicated explicit intention to use MMRCM, which implied that MR gaming and concept maps could be integrated as an effective instructional tool in science education. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Mental models are relevant in both managerial decision making and management education. Decision-making studies have demonstrated how managers benefit from more accurate mental models by gaining higher-quality heuristics and better performance. However, management education studies assessing mental models as learning outcomes remain rare. This study aims at understanding how students' mental models change during a business simulation course. We designed a pre- and post-simulation concept map assignment that illustrated students' mental models as number of concepts, connections between concepts, and written explanations. The findings of our study demonstrate that students’ mental models changed through two interconnected processes: addition of new knowledge and change of misconceptions in existing knowledge. Based on these results, we composed a model of conceptual change through business simulation gaming. Our study contributes to the research on learning from business simulations and addresses the recent call for more conceptual change research in social sciences by enhancing the conceptual change discussion in the management education literature. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Higher-order thinking is crucial to inquiry learning. It is important to investigate how students think in inquiry contexts. Given the tacit nature of higher-order thinking, cognitive maps (e.g., concept maps, reasoning maps) have been used to externalize thinking and have shown promising effects in terms of improving inquiry task performance. However, few studies have analyzed student-constructed maps that reflect the thinking underpinning students’ inquiry task performance. This study aimed to address this gap. Sixty-nine 11th grade students worked in small groups to explain a fish die-off phenomenon in a virtual ecosystem and collaboratively constructed an integrative cognitive map to facilitate thinking during the task. The map comprised a concept map (representing conceptual thinking about relevant subject knowledge) and a reasoning map (representing the reasoning process). Regression analyses showed that the quality of the student-constructed maps, particularly the reasoning maps, was a significant predictor of inquiry task performance assessed based on students’ written explanations of the phenomenon. Although the quality of the concept maps was not a significant predictor of inquiry task performance, it did predict the quality of the reasoning maps. Student thinking reflected in concept mapping and that reflected in reasoning mapping play different roles in inquiry learning. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The present study examines articles published in Zeitschrift für Erziehungswissenschaft (ZfE—Journal of Educational Sciences) between 1998 and 2017, to discover whether the thematic focus of the articles it published during this period changed over time. To do this, we scrutinized articles in four consecutive five-year periods: 1998–2002, 2003–2007, 2008–2012, 2013–2017. Using the titles and abstracts of 821 articles published between 1998 and 2017, we conducted a quantitative text analysis and identified the most frequent and most characteristic bigrams that emerged during these periods. In addition, we looked at whether specific word stems (e.g., “erziehungswissenschaft”, “bildungsforsch”, “didakt”) began to occur more frequently over the two decades under study. Finally, we used the text mining tool Leximancer™ to construct concept maps that point to the semantic structure of the topics and key concepts in the analyzed articles. The results indicate that, over the course of this twenty-year period, the ZfE predominantly published empirical articles with a focus on the social aspects of education, but that its focus on research into general pedagogy decreased in frequency. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - In the relation Lawyer-Client, Deontology plays an important role as a science that refers to the set of rules whose observance allows affirming that a profession is being practiced correctly. Nowadays, there is a situation regarding the fulfillment of these precepts, which compromises the criminal prosecution. Therefore, it is necessary to achieve that those involved understand the basic concepts to achieve the homogeneity in the processes and the fulfillment of the legislation in the due process. In this way, the human rights of those involved will be respected. Therefore, the objective of this document is: to acquire knowledge about the precepts of the Attorney-Client relationship. It is considered that, if this knowledge is acquired, both parties will behave and act in the appropriate manner and the trial will be carried out under the established precepts in compliance with due process. To this end, concept maps will be applied as a tool because they allow for learning and knowledge. © 2021, University of Cienfuegos, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez. All rights reserved.

AB  - The current article addressed middle school (13–15 years old) students’ science-related career awareness (SCA) and aimed to determine the effects of a longitudinal intervention, which focused on integrating career education into science teaching, using a pre-and post-test design. During the intervention, five teaching/learning modules (TLMs) were implemented in science lessons that enabled students to experience being (1) an electrical engineer, (2) a food technologist, (3) a forensic scientist or a civil engineer, (4) a team member of oil catastrophe simulation clean-up team, and (5) a customs’ officer. Concept mapping was used to determine the changes in students’ SCA. The suitability of this technique was validated through semi-structured focus group interviews. It was found that concept mapping enabled detection of progression in the intervention students’ SCA among both boys and girls. The interviews provided valuable input on how students interpreted science-related occupations and relevant competences, when constructing their concept maps. An implication from this study was that SCA supportive teaching and learning modules or other similar teaching methods needed to be an inherent part of science teaching to support students making well informed decisions, either towards or away from science-related careers. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This study adopted a quasi-experimental design with the support of qualitative information to investigate the impact of the mobile microscope on students’ science learning outcomes in a laboratory setting. The duration of the educational experiment was 5 weeks. Research participants comprised 56 third graders from two different classes at a public elementary school in Taiwan. Two classes with an equal number of students formed the experimental and control groups. Students in the experimental group employed mobile microscopes to support their scientific inquiries, whereas students in the control group used only tablet computers to facilitate their science learning. A standardized test was developed to measure students’ basic understanding of botany. Additionally, semi-structured concept mapping was employed as an alternative non-standardized test to evaluate students’ natural science learning. The quantitative findings indicated a significant instructional effect in the students’ concept mapping but not in the standardized test. The qualitative results revealed that mobile microscopes might motivate students to actively engage in knowledge discussion and sharing during plant observation. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Scholars have suggested that flipped learning can be enhanced by designing effective in-class learning activities to improve students' higher order thinking skills. Problem posing has been recognized as such a learning strategy that has great potential for improving students' higher order thinking skills. However, it has been reported as a challenging task for most students. Research evidence has indicated the potential of engaging students in group learning with step-by-step hints when conducting problem-posing activities. Therefore, this study proposed a multilevel concept mapping-based problem-posing strategy to assist students in completing the problem-posing tasks in flipped learning. To understand the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, a flipped learning system was developed and adopted in the science class of an elementary school. Seventy-five fifth graders from three classes were divided into experimental group A, experimental Group B and a control group. Students in Group A used the concept map-guided problem-posing strategy for flipped learning (CMPP-FL), students in Group B used the problem-posing strategy-based flipped learning, while students in the control group used the conventional flipped learning strategy. The results showed that the CMPP-FL was effective in terms of improving students' learning performance, especially for students with higher levels of critical thinking tendency. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Argumentation skills are essential skills needed by students to deal with 21st century life. The implementation of a particular learning model can help students hone their argumentation skills. Reading-Concept Mapping-Numbered Heads Together (Remap-NHT) is a learning model of which syntax has the potential to promote students' argumentation skills. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of the Remap-NHT learning model on students' argumentation skills. This study was designed as a quasi-experiment using a nonequivalent pretest-posttest control group design. This study's respondents were 100 eleventh grade students who came from three Natural Science Program classes at SMA Negeri 4 Malang, Indonesia, in the academic year of 2019/2020. This study's data were obtained using a pretest and a posttest that contained essay tests on Biology lessons. The participants' test answers were evaluated using an argumentation skill scoring rubric and analyzed using One-way ANCOVA. Before the ANCOVA analysis, normality and homogeneity tests had been conducted. The statistical analyses showed that there was a significant difference between learners in Remap-NHT, NHT, and conventional groups in terms of performance in argumentation skills. Among the three learning models, Remap-NHT was proven to improve students' argumentation skills compared to NHT and conventional. Therefore, Remap-NHT can be used as an alternative model to promote students' argumentation skills. © 2021 Author(s).

AB  - The proposed lesson, a model active-learning activity designed to give college students experience in synthesizing information and developing a solution, can be used to address socioscientific issues across fields. As a consequence of climate change, global temperatures are anticipated to rise. This rise in temperature is expected to have a negative impact on agricultural systems due in part to increased disease incidence and decrease in crop yields. This activity is written in the context of plant pathology and agricultural systems to emphasize the importance of collaboration and communication among scientists or experts in different fields to address global agricultural issues. Students will gain an understanding of the importance of agriculture on a global scale and work together to develop a solution through the development of an agricultural policy. © 2021 by The Regents of the University of California.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present an empirical study with the intention of answering the question: can an intentionally structured online environment stimulate and enhance the processes of mutual interaction and hybridization between digital artefacts and analogic artefacts (books) so as to encourage the development of significant learning in students? This research, carried out in the academic year 2018/2019, involved 183 Italian students enrolled on the bachelor's degree in Primary Education Sciences at the University of Salerno attending the course “School experimentation and educational planning”. The data were collected by working out and using an information retrieval questionnaire and four different tests. The virtual interaction space was e-LENA, the Learning Management System of the RIMEDI@ research lab. The experimental results highlight how this methodology, called DynaMap Remediation Approach (DMRA) by the authors, has had effects in terms of reducing study time and improving learning outcomes. The online learning environment stimulated to study in greater detail with a book, with the learner being able to restructure and systematize his own knowledge. The DMRA valorises the active role of the learner during his process of knowledge construction and may have significant implications for educators who would like to use innovative and effective online learning environments to enhance student learning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presents a digital learning tool, MESTRAL (“Modélisation Et Simulation des TRansformations ALimentaires”, “Modelling and Simulating Food Processing” in English), that can provide educators with a tool to teach food processing using simulators and a broad range of models derived from research in food science & engineering. It was built using electronic knowledge books (eK-book). The eK-book represents knowledge in the form of concept maps and knowledge sheets, connected via a network of hypertext links. MESTRAL encompasses 15 modules, that cover approximately 150 h of teaching and a broad range of real systems, from a single unit operation (e.g., frying a banana) to a logistic chain (e.g., ham cold chain). Each module conveys information on a food product or a food process, and includes a simulator based on a published scientific model. Altogether, the models address various scale of systems and are based on different theoretical frameworks. For each simulator, the model inputs and outputs are stored in a database. Outputs are visualized through abacuses, which can be used for virtual practice. MESTRAL modules also include training exercises and tests to help students to assess the knowledge they have acquired during consultation of the modules. Finally, MESTRAL has already been successfully tested by different audiences according to various learning forms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Education is critical for improving energy efficiency and reducing CO2 concentration, but collaboration between countries is also critical. It is a global problem in which we cannot isolate ourselves. Our students must learn to collaborate in seeking solutions together with others from other countries. Thus, the research question of this study is whether interactive cross-border science classes with energy experiments are feasible and can increase awareness of energy efficiency among middle school students. We designed and tested an interactive cross-border class between Chilean and Peruvian eighth-grade classes. The classes were synchronously connected and all students did experiments and answered open-ended questions on an online platform. Some of the questions were designed to check conceptual understanding whereas others asked for suggestions of how to develop their economies while keeping CO2 air concentration at acceptable levels. In real time, the teacher reviewed the students’ written answers and the concept maps that were automatically generated based on their responses. Students peer-reviewed their classmates’ suggestions. This is part of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Science Technology Engineering Mathematics (STEM) education project on energy efficiency using APEC databases. We found high levels of student engagement, where students discussed not only the cross-cutting nature of energy, but also its relation to socioeconomic development and CO2 emissions, and the need to work together to improve energy efficiency. In conclusion, interactive cross-border science classes are a feasible educational alternative, with potential as a scalable public policy strategy for improving awareness of energy efficiency among the population. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Ethical issues arise daily in the delivery of palliative care. Despite much (largely theoretical) literature, evidence from specialist palliative care practitioners about day-to-day ethical challenges has not previously been synthesised. This evidence is crucial to inform education and adequately support staff. Aim: To synthesise the evidence regarding the ethical challenges which specialist palliative care practitioners encounter during clinical practice. Design: Systematic review with narrative synthesis (PROSPERO registration CRD42018105365). Quality was dual-assessed using the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. Tabulation, textural description, concept mapping and thematic synthesis were used to develop and present the narrative. Data sources: Seven databases (MEDLINE, Philosopher’s Index, EMBASE, PsycINFO, LILACS, Web of Science and CINAHL) were searched from inception to December 2019 without language limits. Eligible papers reported original research using inductive methods to describe practitioner-reported ethical challenges. Results: A total of 8074 records were screened. Thirteen studies from nine countries were included. Challenges were organised into six themes: application of ethical principles; delivering clinical care; working with families; engaging with institutional structures and values; navigating societal values and expectations; philosophy of palliative care. Challenges related to specific scenarios/contexts rather than the application of general ethical principles, and occurred at all levels (bedside, institution, society, policy). Conclusion: Palliative care practitioners encounter a broad range of contextual ethical challenges, many of which are not represented in palliative care ethics training resources, for example, navigating institutional policies, resource allocation and inter-professional conflict. Findings have implications for supporting ethical practice and training practitioners. The lack of low- and middle- income country data needs addressing. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Introduction: Accurate clinical decision-making of dentists should be based on their knowledge and experience. In the past 10 years, interest in competency-based dentistry education has rapidly increased, but there has been little attention paid to methods of improving dental education competency. The purpose of this study was to develop a clinical presentation education model that provides opportunities for students to practice problem-solving from the moment they greet the patient so that students can obtain the practical experience of competency-based education and the effectiveness of this model can be confirmed through pilot test. Methods: This article is divided two parts: First, developing the clinical presentation dental education model (CPDEM) and Second, a pilot study adopted CPDEM. To confirm the effectiveness of this model, the students' satisfaction, their perception of self-achievement were analysed. Results: Clinical presentation dental education model has been developed to provide practice-related education experience and provide linkage between basic science and clinical science. The result of applying this education model to 10 students as a pilot test was shown an overall high satisfaction level. In addition, self-achievement students’ reported of all intended competencies was higher than for non-participating students of this model. Conclusions: This study focuses on practical education centring on clinical presentation. This model could get a meaningful and realistic experiences through the practice using clinical presentation of patients, use their metacognition for organizing and memorizing the patient's case by using concept map. It can be used as a future instructional method to enhance students' competency. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to examine the views of preservice science teachers on concept map use in a General Chemistry II class. The study was conducted with 47 preservice science teachers. In the study, an interview form grounded on determining their views on concept maps and comprised of open-ended questions, was used as the data collection tool. In analysis of the data acquired, content analysis was performed. As a result of the analysis of the data, the preservice teachers expressed positive views on concept map use. They stated that it might contribute to their learning and increase the permanence of the knowledge learned. Furthermore, they reported that they liked creating concept maps and among the concept map types they usually chose to create hierarchical concept maps. Most of the preservice teachers stated that they had to know the subject related to the concept map very well to create concept maps more easily, otherwise they might have a difficulty in the concept map creation process and thus concept maps should generally be used after a lecture. In addition the preservice teachers stated that they intended to use concept maps in their teaching experience. As a result, before concept maps are used in teaching, it is recommended to inform students about the creation of concept maps, to use them for re-purpose in teaching activities, and to include activities containing concept maps in textbooks. © 2021 International Council of Associations for Science Education (ICASE).

AB  - The presented research focuses on verifying the confluent application of concept mapping (CM) and socio-scientific issues (SSI) according to the value-laden and moral dilemma orientation to con-struct problem-solving performance. This research sets up some perspectives for all 146 participants, including 139 students and 7 experts. All findings reveal that the design of SSICM contexts includes a rebut-tal process and incense claim to improve students’ argument response (16.4%), to increase content knowledge and illuminate their science learning by argumentations. To develop an assessment tool with high validity and reliability (Cronbach’s α > .9) and find positive presentations of all learning attitudes in the SSICM context, learning environment and results will concern the best argumentation process. Students’ interview responses and SWOT analysis of teachers indicate that SSICM’s use of argument in the classroom is a real benefit. The research provided a better paradigm of attempts to combine analytical and academic hypotheses to explain literature sources by teachers, researchers, textbook developers, and editors. © 2021, Scientia Socialis Ltd.

AB  - Analytical quality assurance, especially testing, is an integral part of software-intensive system development. With the increased usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as part of such systems, this becomes more difficult as well-understood software testing approaches cannot be applied directly to the AI-enabled parts of the system. The required adaptation of classical testing approaches and the development of new concepts for AI would benefit from a deeper understanding and exchange between AI and software engineering experts. We see the different terminologies used in the two communities as a major obstacle on this way. As we consider a mutual understanding of the testing terminology a key, this paper contributes a mapping between the most important concepts from classical software testing and AI testing. In the mapping, we highlight differences in the relevance and naming of the mapped concepts. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This study examined self-descriptions of high-performing students and other students and compared the descriptions of these two groups. The concept map, with the open-ended question “Who am I?,” was completed by 133 high-performing students and 160 other students. The self-descriptions of these students were subdivided into eleven categories. High-performing students reported mainly characteristics and skills, followed by sport. This pattern was reversed for the other students. School or scholastic skills, both positive and negative, were mentioned more often by high-performing students. Other notable differences between those groups and specific age and gender differences are discussed. The insights from this study are relevant for science, because studies concerning self-concept of primary school students are scarce, and for educational practice, because teachers might use concept maps in their classroom. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - In Trinidad and Tobago, occupational therapy is an emerging profession with limitations in the number of practitioners and the scope of practice. With the development of a new Master of Science Occupational Therapy programme in the country, the profession is continuously growing. There has been an increased demand for culturally relevant research to build the occupational therapy evidence base locally. However, the narrow range of occupational therapy literature in the country makes it difficult to highlight research gaps and decipher what research areas should be prioritised to best impact occupational therapy practice at present. This group concept mapping study is aimed at identifying priority areas for occupational therapy research in Trinidad and Tobago from the perspectives of occupational therapy students and practitioners. Participants brainstormed and contributed specific research ideas they would like to see developed in the country. Individually, participants sorted these ideas into themes and rated each idea based on perceived importance and feasibility. Using the GroupWisdom™ software, multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses were applied to the sort data to create idea clusters within a concept map. Rating values were analysed to determine priority research themes within the concept map. The resulting concept map illustrated seven research priorities: Contextualising Practitioner Development, The Realities of Emerging OT Practice, Localising Mental Health OT, Occupation and Participation of Children and Youth, School-based OT in the Local Context, OT with Special Populations, and OT Contributions to the Public Health Sector. These findings represent the research needs of the occupational therapy profession in Trinidad and Tobago and will help to focus future researchers' efforts to expand the local evidence base. © 2021 Savannah Murray-Mendes et al.

Especially, prerequisite relations among concepts play a very important role in various intelligent education applications, such as concept map extraction, learning object sequencing, reading order list generation. In this paper, we investigate the problem of extracting prerequisite relations among Wikipedia concepts. We take advantage of Wikipedia clickstream data and related concept sets to discover prerequisite relations among Wikipedia concepts. Evaluations on two datasets that include nine domains show that the proposed method can cover most of the concept pairs, and achieves significant improvements (+1.7–31.0% by Accuracy) comparing with existing methods. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Technology is rapidly changing the world around us and thus, there is a need to adjust education by teaching children skills that are required in the fast-paced digital life. One problem-solving skillset, which has gained considerable attention in the last couple of years, is computational thinking (CT). Up to now, many countries have already implemented CT as an integral part of their education curricula, however, there is still often the misconception that teaching CT requires high technical effort and profound knowledge of computer science. Whereas CT is useful in any subject, it is not necessarily linked to technology and helps children to tackle problems by applying skills that are used in computer science. One effective hands-on approach to foster CT in every subject is modeling. A model is a simplified and reduced version of the real world and modeling is the process of creating it. In this paper, the authors focus on fostering CT skills with models from the field of computer science (CS) in foreign language teaching. The authors present several CS models, that have proven to be useful in language teaching, demonstrate how this approach can foster CT skills and give an insight into their research. © 2021 Marina Rottenhofer et al., published by De Gruyter 2021.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to investigate the effect of prediction-observation-explanation (POE) technique on students' academic achievement and concept learning on seventh grade mass and weight. The research is based on a pretest-posttest simple experimental design model with quantitative background. The sample of the study consists of 19, 7th grade students attending a secondary school in Çorum province. As data collection tool, achievement test consisting of open-ended questions, concept map test and semi-structured interview form were used. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, difference analysis and content analysis. Wilcoxon signed rank test from nonparametric tests was used to compare the achievement of students before and after the application. Interviews with students were conducted through content analysis. As a result of the study, it was determined that POE technique significantly increased the academic achievement of students in terms of mass and weight and was effective in eliminating misconceptions of students and changing their images positively. As a result of the study, various suggestions were made such as conducting similar studies with larger samples and applying different techniques on the same subject. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Introduction. The competitive advantage in the field of critical knowledge and technology exacerbates the problem of the effectiveness of intellectual activity and the means of its support in science, production and education. Such visual aids, formed by conceptual and graphic elements, such as concept maps, frames, structural logic diagrams, etc., contribute to the theoretical analysis and generalisation of the formed images and representations of learners. According to the degree of the development of these visual aids, the emphasis shifts from the function of visibility to the function of the organisation of activities. The term "visibility" (associated with the initial images of perception and representation) is substituted by the term "regulator" (focused on the organisation of further activities of the student). The hypothesis assumes the expediency of the development of conceptual and graphic means of visualisation in the form of visual didactic regulations, which are the subject of research. The present research aims: To discuss the problem of the creation of didactic regulations for educational activities; to study the development of conceptual-graphic means of visibility and factors for improving their functionality; to forecast the development of this type of means based on the visualisation of the logical-semantic modelling of knowledge; to clarify terminology and applied aspects; and to conduct experimental approbation in the conditions of distance learning. Methodology and research methods. The research methodology is based on the fundamental didactic principle of visualisation, which is necessary for the transition in the process of cognition from sensory perception to abstract thinking and contributes to the combination of abstract thinking with visualisation in teaching. The research methodology is also based on the method of logical-semantic modelling of knowledge and the following criteria for the study of conceptual-graphic means of visualisation: The application of the cognitive principles of knowledge representation; the use of universal instructional analysis activities to transform knowledge; the applicability of graphical representation of content. The methodology for the formation of didactic regulations included a visual presentation of the results of logical-semantic modelling of knowledge using universal educational actions and coordinate-matrix graphics. The method of experimental approbation of regulations in distance learning involved: The participation of students of four specialities and university teachers; a questionnaire survey of students; mastering, designing and using didactic regulations on the topic of experimental studies. Results and scientific novelty. The search on the databases of scientific documents of the Russian Academy of Education, the Electronic Scientific Library, Scopus, WOS and the Internet revealed the apparent lack of research and development of didactic regulations of a conceptual-graphic type. It was established that the main reason for the development of conceptual and graphic means of visualisation is the complexity of the tasks to be solved in science, production and education. It is demonstrated that the improvement of the functionality of conceptual and graphical tools is explained by the application of the principles of cognitive visual representation of knowledge and the method of logical-semantic modelling. The basic structures of the regulations were predicted and formed; the terminology of the research approach was clarified; the application of the tools for educational and project-based activities, interfaces of computer training programs is considered. Practical significance. The functionality of visual didactic regulators expands the potential of visibility and complements the tools of the teacher and the student. Moreover, they can be used in teaching technologies, research activities and design, when creating computer training programs. © 2021 Russian State Vocational Pedagogical University.

AB  - Introduction: Vertically integrating physiology into patient care has the potential to improve clinical reasoning. Clinical Physiology Grand Rounds (CPGR) is a case-based teaching method that brings together students from all years of medical school to focus on linking clinical presentations to core basic science concepts including anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. In this study, we describe the implementation of CPGR at two different institutions in the United States and assess student-reported outcomes. Methods: We survey students who participated in CPGR at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons (P&S) and Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Subjects were queried across three domains: the benefits of attending, the impact of concept maps, and the impact of the mixed-learner environment. Results: Despite differences in session leadership and the underlying medical school curricula, conference attendees reported similar benefits at the two schools included in this study. Students overwhelmingly (92.9%) reported that remembering clinical presentations was easier when they understood the underlying physiology. They also reported gaining a true understanding of concepts that were previously memorized (87.5%). Both clinical (92.5%) and preclinical students (93.1%) valued the mixed-learner environment as a component of the conference. Discussion: By assuring a mixed-learner environment with near-peer interactions, using concept maps as a teaching tool, and rigorously linking clinical presentation and management to physiological concepts, we found that the key benefits of CPGR were replicable across different institutions, despite several local differences in how CPGR was implemented, led, and conducted. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Developing students’ ability to think about systems, as opposed to isolated facts, is of central importance in much of science teaching. Prior work in this area has focused on students’ recognition of the processes occurring within a system. Comparatively, little work has been done on how students organise the objects that are contained within the system. Understanding how objects are organised within a system structure can promote understanding of the processes relating to the objects and advance students’ thinking about systems. A systematic literature review revealed different existing theoretical perspectives on object arrangement within systems. These perspectives were combined into a single framework, the Systems Object Framework (SOF), that can be used to characterise student ideas about object arrangements. The SOF was used to analyse object arrangements depicted by students in pre and post-concept maps that were collected as part of a study on a systems-based curriculum. This analysis provided support for the structure of the SOF and showed that the SOF allows for tracking of changes in students’ representation of object arrangements. The SOF contributes to the field by proposing new questions to be investigated and providing a common analytical tool that permits greater consistency across future studies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - With the advancements in technology networks, mobile learning has been extensively applied in teaching contexts, enabling closer interaction between students and authentic environments. Previous studies have indicated that, when learning in real-world contexts, students need to interact with real learning targets and peers as well as the digital learning content; thus, effective learning strategies or tools are generally required for helping them organize knowledge and for promoting peer interactions. As a result, the present study developed a bi-directional peer-assessment-based concept mapping system, which not only engages students in assessing peers’ concept maps, but also encourages them to evaluate or respond to peers’ ratings and comments. To explore the effectiveness of this learning system, the study conducted an experiment in elementary science classes. A total of 101 fifth graders from four classes were recruited to participate in the study. Two classes were assigned to the experimental group and two to the control group. The experimental group adopted the bi-directional peer-assessment approach, while the control group adopted the conventional peer assessment approach for concept mapping. The results reveal that the bi-directional peer-assessment-based concept mapping system can not only increase students’ learning achievement and the completeness of their concept mapping, but can also enhance their critical thinking tendency and the feedback quality of their peer assessment. © 2020 British Educational Research Association

AB  - As an ability to support claims by collecting evidence and establishing connections between evidence and claims, the cultivation of argumentation ability plays an important role in science education. In this study, an online concept map tool was introduced into argumentation instruction separately with the method of flipped classroom. A control group post-Test true-experiment was conducted in a classroom with 79 pre-service teachers. The results showed that the total score and all aspects of the experimental group were generally superior to the control group. However, no significant difference was found between the two groups in the post-Test. For this, this study analyzes the possible reasons. In addition, the students showed a positive attitude towards learning using concept maps. Implications for future research are discussed. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper. Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for cross-curricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Background: One approach to enhancing the pedagogy of science education is to employ academics who are not only science-trained but also engaged in education research. As some academics begin their Scholarship of Teaching and Learning research careers with a pure science background, shifting in disciplinary perspectives can be a source of professional tension. The pedagogic frailty model provides a framework that helps us to integrate institutional efforts to enhance teaching improvements by maintaining a simultaneous focus on critical areas that are thought to impede academic development. Purpose: This paper draws attention to the importance of disciplinary crossover by uncovering and comparing academics’ teaching perspectives, views and beliefs from three disciplines: natural science (chemistry), social science (education) and science education. Method: Through a case study design using the pedagogic frailty model and concept map-mediated interviews as a tool, three academics engaged in a non-linear discourse in which their conceptions could be visualised and analysed. Findings and Discussion: Analysis of the case study interviews indicated that the academics’ conceptions of teaching were highly individualised. The discourse surrounding the curriculum, and the embeddedness of and connection between pedagogy and discipline, were both subject-sensitive and influenced by professional backgrounds and research areas. On the other hand, because they operated under the same institutional values and regulations, we found a considerable overlap in terms of how the academics perceived the tensions between research and teaching and academic leadership. By comparing three academics who were at a different stage in the journey from disciplinary experts (chemistry) to teaching expert (education), we were able to uncover and understand more about the ways that the teaching environment impacted upon their practices. The science educator shared aspects of the other two perspectives, which suggests that his profile was a transitory state in comparison with the chemist and the educationist. Conclusion: The findings provide a glimpse of the distinctive nature of the values that underpin teaching and offer insights that can be used to promote dialogue about quality enhancement in science education. © 2020 NFER.

AB  - Safe, effective and ethical clinical decision-making in nursing depends on critical thinking, yet there is no consensus on the educational strategies that are most effective in developing and refining this foundational skill. A qualitative inquiry among graduating Bachelor of Science in Nursing students sought to determine whether one such educational strategy, an operationalized critical thinking framework, would assist nursing students to better understand acute care patients' complex profiles. The Safe Care Framework™, consisting of the ‘Concept Map Template’ and the ‘Priority Setting Tool Template’, was developed using a constructivist pedagogical approach. The framework illustrates and operationalizes the systematic critical thinking processes that expert nurses use to provide safe, comprehensive care. Thematic analysis of qualitative survey results revealed the following three main themes; (1) greater organization and understanding of patient data; (2) guiding of assessments and priorities of care; (3) better communication with others, and several subthemes. Thus, the Safe Care Framework™ may be a practical operational tool that can support novice nurses in developing critical thinking skills. This framework adds to the literature on innovative pedagogy for nurse educators. © 2020 The Author

AB  - Students of initial level programming courses generally face difficulties while learning the programming concepts. The learning analytics studies, in these courses, are mostly anecdotal on the aspect of assessment as less or no attention is given to assess learning at various cognitive levels of specific concepts. Furthermore, the existing work reflects deficiencies in examining the effect of learners' cognitive performance on subsequent stages of the course. This gap needs to be addressed by introducing more granular and methodical approaches of cognitive analysis for sustaining the programming courses effectively in computer science and associated disciplines. In this article, a framework-based approach is proposed for cognitive learning analytics on the concepts taught in initial level programming courses. The framework serves as a platform that provides structure to the concept data using the technique of concept mapping and examines learners' cognitive propagation on related concepts using assessment data. Learners' performance prediction has been examined on relatively higher-level programming concepts through the metrics established from the cognitive maps of learners, acquired by deploying the related layers of framework. Overall maximum prediction accuracy range obtained was 64.81% to 90.86%, which was better than the prediction accuracies presented in most of the related studies. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: HIV continues to devastate the adolescent population in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The complex array of interpersonal, social, structural and system-level obstacles specific to adolescents have slowed progress in prevention and treatment of HIV in this population. The field of implementation science holds promise for addressing these challenges. Discussion: There is growing consensus that enhanced interactions between researchers and users of scientific evidence are important and necessary to tackle enduring barriers to implementation. In 2017, the Fogarty International Center launched the Adolescent HIV Prevention and Treatment Implementation Science Alliance (AHISA) to promote communication and catalyse collaboration among implementation scientists and implementers to enhance the cross-fertilization of insights as research advances and the implementation environment evolves. This network has identified key implementation science questions for adolescent HIV, assessed how members’ research is addressing them, and is currently conducting a concept mapping exercise to more systematically identify implementation research priorities. In addition, AHSA pinpointed common challenges to addressing these questions and discussed their collective capacity to conduct implementation science using the shared learning approach of the network. Specifically, AHISA addresses challenges related to capacity building, developing mentorship, engaging stakeholders, and involving adolescents through support for training efforts and funding region-/country-specific networks that respond to local issues and increase implementation science capacity across SSA. Conclusions: Innovative platforms, like AHISA, that foster collaborations between implementation science researchers, policymakers and community participants to prioritizes research needs and identify and address implementation challenges can speed the translation of effective HIV interventions to benefit adolescent health. © 2020 World Health Organization; licensed by IAS.

AB  - Objective: Team based learning (TBL) is shown to have a positive impact on learning abilities. In this study, we compared the individual and group readiness assurance grades of dental students toward a modified TBL protocol for an orthodontic topic. Methods: All of the dentistry students in 2 different annual intakes from Shiraz University of Medical Sciences took part in the study. The references and methods for holding the class was presented to the vice dean of educational affairs and to the students. At the beginning of the session, individual readiness assurance test (iRAT) was held. Then, the students were asked to arrange in 15-member groups for a modified TBL exercise. Each group took part in the team readiness assessment test (tRAT) and draw concept maps of 5 major topics. Then, they presented their team work, discussed them, and concluded. At the end of the session, the students reported their attitude on the pre-constructed assay form. The data were analyzed with SPSS software 17, using paired T test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: We observed statistically significant improvement in the tRAT score compared with iRAT in the male and female participants (P-value <0.001). More than 60% of the participants felt that TBL enhanced the overall satisfaction and pleasure from participation in class. Conclusions: Based on our study, team work depicted significant improvement in the students' scores of an orthodontic topic. According to students, satisfaction with TBL was favorable and improved with additional experience. © 2020 American Dental Education Association

AB  - Industry 4.0 relevant systems (eg, cyber-physical systems, digital twins, and alike) need digitized knowledge to function. Before digitizing knowledge, a fundamental question arises: What is knowledge? In order to answer this question, this study first reviews the definitions of knowledge found in the extant literature of epistemology, engineering design, manufacturing, organization science, information science, and education science. Since the definitions reported so far are not succinct and suffer circularity, this study overcomes this by introducing a three-element-based definition of knowledge—a piece knowledge consists of three elements defined as claim, provenance, and inference. This results in four types of knowledge defined as definitional, deductive, inductive, and creative knowledge, and each type of knowledge is again divided into some categories. Some real-life scenarios relevant to engineering design and manufacturing are used to clarify the proposed knowledge types/categories; the relevant pieces of knowledge are represented by knowledge graphs (concept maps) for the sake of digitization. The myriad proximal and distal relationships between knowledge and other relevant entities (human/machine learning, logical inferences, experimental data, analytical results, creative thinking, and cognitive reflections) become succinct and transparent due to the proposed definition of knowledge. Consequently, this study establishes the fundamentals of developing sophisticated methods and tools for the advancement of Industry 4.0. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Although medical education has historically emphasized the role and import-ance of basic science in clinical reasoning, educators have struggled to teach basic science to optimize its use for students. Concept mapping helps students develop relationships between basic and clinical science, which can enhance understanding of the material. Educators at the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine developed a weekly concept-mapping activity connecting biomedical principles with clinical signs, symp-toms, and laboratory values from a comprehensive clinical case. This activity elicits cross-disciplinary discussion, illustrates content integration by the students, and enhances faculty collaboration across disciplines. © 2020 American Osteopathic Association.

AB  - Concept maps were created as one of six measures to identify exceptionally talented students during the Cultivating Diverse Talent in STEM (CDTIS) project, with the goal of identifying and nurturing talents in students from groups traditionally underrepresented in special programs. New methods were compared with conventional methods to select students for an internship in the laboratories of scientists. In this article, we describe development, field testing, and implementation of the concept map assessments in life and physical science. Assessments were field tested in partner schools with high percentages of American Indian (97% to 100%) and Hispanic (83%) low-income students. Students were selected by considering their performance on all six assessments and were placed in internships along with students selected using conventional methods. Concept maps were successful: (a) students from partner schools demonstrated high levels of domain-relevant skills; (b) scores approximated a normal distribution; (c) scores of students from culturally diverse, low-income groups were very similar to the scores of students selected using conventional methods even though many of conventionally identified students had high grade point averages and came from schools in high-income areas with many educational opportunities. Students completed original research and presented posters to the university community and their local communities. Concept maps can be used alone or in combination with other assessments; their use needs to be studied with larger groups of students and in other contexts. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In the Cultivating Diverse Talent in STEM project, funded by the National Science Foundation in the United States, new assessments were developed, field tested, used to identify students with exceptional talent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and compared with existing methods (grade point average [GPA], letters of recommendation, self-statements). Students identified by both methods participated in an internship program in laboratories of scientists on the campus of an R1 university in the Southwest. Existing methods limited the diversity of students identified. Significant differences were found between students identified by the new methods (M2) and existing methods (M1) in GPA, ethnicity, and parent level of education. Ethnicity differences may be due to the ethnic makeup of the partner schools, but differences in GPA and parent level of education cannot be attributed to the location of schools. Although GPAs of M1 students were significantly higher (3.71) than those of M2 students (3.07) and M1 students came from higher income groups and schools in higher income areas, the M2 students scored higher on all the performance assessments of creative problem-solving and at similar levels on concept maps and mathematical problem-solving. Studies of the usefulness and psychometric properties of the new assessments are needed with different groups and in different contexts. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - A research team consisting of educators of gifted students, a scientist, and experts in measurement developed a performance-based assessment of life science skills and abilities. Four high schools in the Southwestern United States were the settings for field testing and implementation. Five levels of ratings were given: unknown, maybe, probably, definitely, and wow. The majority of student scores were in the maybe and probably categories. Using six new measures (concept maps in life and physical science, math problem solving, spatial analytical performance assessment, life science performance assessment and physical science performance assessment), 23 students (M2) were selected for participation in science laboratories at an R1 university along with 20 students (M1) selected by conventional means. When the nine attribute scores of the performance-based assessment were compared, no significant difference was found t(41), p >.38, between M1 and M2 students. Performance-based assessments in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will provide an alternative and a complement to standard achievement tests. They have the potential to identify and nurture exceptionally talented high school students across all demographic groups. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - As medical schools have changed their curricula to address foundational and clinical sciences in a more integrated fashion, teaching methods such as concept mapping have been incorporated in small group learning settings. Methods that can assess students’ ability to apply such integrated knowledge are not as developed, however. The purpose of this project was to assess the validity of scores on a focused version of concept maps called mechanistic case diagrams (MCDs), which are hypothesized to enhance existing tools for assessing integrated knowledge that supports clinical reasoning. The data were from the medical school graduating class of 2018 (N = 136 students). In 2014–2015 we implemented a total of 16 case diagrams in case analysis groups within the Mechanisms of Health and Disease (MOHD) strand of the pre-clinical curriculum. These cases were based on topics being taught during the lectures and small group sessions for MOHD. We created an overall score across all 16 cases for each student. We then correlated these scores with performance in the preclinical curriculum [as assessed by overall performance in MOHD integrated foundational basic science courses and overall performance in the Clinical and Professional Skills (CAPS) courses], and standardized licensing exam scores [United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)] Step 1 (following core clerkships) and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (at the beginning of the fourth year of medical school). MCD scores correlated with students’ overall basic science scores (r =.46, p =.0002) and their overall performance in Clinical and Professional Skills courses (r =.49, p <.0001). In addition, they correlated significantly with standardized exam measures, including USMLE Step 1 (r =.33, p ≤.0001), and USMLE Step 2 CK (r =.39, p <.0001). These results provide preliminary validity evidence that MCDs may be useful in identifying students who have difficulty in integrating foundational and clinical sciences. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The lack of students' critical thinking skills especially in Science can affect the Malaysia education system. This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of Collaborative Concept Mapping (CCM) and Individual Concept Mapping (ICM) in improving students' critical thinking skills in science subjects. This study used the quasi-experimental research design that involved 189 form one students from public secondary schools in Malaysia. The manipulated variable in this study is teaching approaches, which includes Collaborative Concept Mapping (CCM), Individual Concept Mapping (ICM) and conventional method (CM). Meanwhile, the dependent variable is students' critical thinking skills in Science. Data was collected using critical thinking skills diagnostic tests and analysed using one-way ANOVA test. The one-way ANOVA indicated that the students in CCM group showed significantly higher level of critical thinking skills as compared to those in the ICM and CM groups. While, there is no significant difference in the level of critical thinking skills between students in ICM and CM groups. Therefore, CCM is effective in fostering students' critical thinking skills compare to ICM and CM teaching approaches. CCM can be used as an alternative teaching approach in science classroom to enhance students' critical thinking skills. © 2020 Published by ISRES Publishing

AB  - Science educators have developed a variety of assessment techniques to help students connect their scientific knowledge and bridge conceptual gaps. In chemistry, concept maps and creative exercises are the two notable assessments that have been implemented into multiple chemistry courses and indicated promising effects on students' conceptual learning and connection-making between chemistry concepts. These two assessment techniques were usually implemented individually in research studies. Herein, we employed a quasi-experimental, mixed-methods approach to explore whether combining concept maps and creative exercises would reveal any synergistic effects for student learning of chemical equilibrium and acid-base chemistry in a college general chemistry course. In this study, student perceptions of the use of the two assessments were examined by open-ended surveys. Interestingly, students perceived creative exercises as an assessment technique while concept maps were viewed as a learning tool for studying or reviewing exams. Additionally, Students believed that concept maps assisted them in answering creative exercises, but not vice versa. The four study groups (control group, concept maps only, creative exercises only, and both concept maps and creative exercises) were compared through concept inventory pre and post-test questions. The results of an ANCOVA indicated that participation in the experimental groups did not significantly impact conceptual learning gains, as measured by the concept inventory post-test scores. However, focus group interviews indicated students from the experimental group that used both concept maps and creative exercises were able to provide more sophisticated scientific explanations for conceptual questions related to the topics of chemical equilibrium and acid-base chemistry. Implications of these research results, best practices for implementation of the two assessments, and future research are discussed. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The Introduction to Programming and Computation at Wayne State University (WSU), which is a required foundational course in MATLAB taken by six different engineering majors, was not perceived well by students, which affected engineering retention. At the onset of the course, many students were apprehensive about the material. From discussions with students, we learned that a number of students did not see connections between this course and courses in their major, or the usefulness of the material in their future careers. Beginning in Fall 2016 several pedagogical changes were incorporated into the course. The full study collected student data to see the effects each aspect had on different student groups. This work in progress paper will examine the student's perceptions of course structure and support based on their demographic information. Prior to this study, the course was taught in 70-100 person sections primarily in a lecture style. Topics in the course were only vaguely connected to their chosen disciple and thus students would struggle to find the benefit in the course. Many students had never programmed before and found the thought process completely foreign. As has been seen at other universities, this contributed to students' lack of engagement and dissatisfaction [1]. Females and minorities are chronically underrepresented in engineering [2] and industry is continually calling for additional engineers [3, 4]. Extensive research has been done on ways to increase student engagement and success in STEM fields [5-7]. The 2012 President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology report Engage to Excel lists these as strongly supported practices: small group discussion and peer instruction, testing, one-minute papers, clickers, problem-based learning, case studies, analytical challenges before lectures, group tests, problem sets in groups, concept mapping, writing with peer review, computer simulations and games, and combinations of active learning methods [8]. Studies have shown that female engineering students cite the availability of external support and group work as supporting their success [9]. We capitalized on that foundation by incorporating a wide range of active learning strategies into an entry-level class creating a more interactive environment to support all students' success. In addition to the classroom environment, student motivations and perceptions can affect outcomes for programming courses. Previous work has been done on several student factors. Initial motivation, goal orientation, and instrumentality were studied by Shell et al as contributing factors [10]. Bergin and Reilly reported on the role of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and self-efficacy in learning programming [11]. Duckworth has reviewed the role of grit and self-control [12]. Data was collected in this study related to these topics, retention, and achievement of learning outcomes and is currently being analyzed for future papers. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.

AB  - In recent years engineering curricula have had a renewed focus on engineering design. At the University of British Columbia undergraduate students have a general first year and then apply to engineering majors for their second-year of study. In the first-year engineering program, there is a two-course sequence where students are introduced to general engineering design. This is done through a variety of case studies in modules lasting 3 to 4 weeks. The Chemical and Biological Engineering Department through consultations with stakeholders such as students, faculty, alumni and industry saw a need to integrate more engineering design practice into the second and third years of the undergraduate programs it offers. Based on this, the department has introduced a series of two new second-year undergraduate courses introducing engineering science fundamentals and design. These courses integrate some content from courses they replace while also introducing new content, specifically around engineering design. The new second-year courses build on student design experiences from first-year while introducing students to more discipline-specific design processes. The first course in this series focuses on chemical engineering and the second course on biological engineering. This current research focuses on the impact of the first course in this series. Concept maps have been shown to be a powerful and flexible way of assessing student learning. They have been implemented in a wide variety of contexts such as in design and conceptual knowledge assessment. Students were asked to create a concept map for chemical engineering at the start (pre) and end (post) of the course outlining the 10-20 most important concepts in chemical and biological engineering and how they are related. Students completed this exercise using a concept mapping tool (CmapTools). These responses were then analyzed using a thematic analysis. Results from this were used to compare common themes in class responses at the start and end of the course. It was found that students at the end of the course converged on five particular topics which were focus areas in the newly implemented design course, suggesting an effective teaching practice. A shift in themes was seen from scientific topics (eg. organic chemistry, math) to engineering science or design topics (material balances, energy balances, process control, etc), which can be explained by the gain in familiarity with the field. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.

AB  - Greater attention to promoting entrepreneurial mindset and innovation among STEM disciplines in recent years enhances the potential role for science and engineering majors as changemakers. The efforts by the emerging and growing Physics Innovation and Entrepreneurship (PIE) community in recent years bear resemblance to and overlaps with the efforts of engineering educators in terms of cultivating entrepreneurial mindset among college students. Physics Innovation and Entrepreneurship (PIE) efforts at Loyola University Maryland is shaped by the launch of two NSF funded initiatives; the Pathways to Innovation in 2015 and the PIPELINE Network; an NSF collaborative research grant in 2016. One of the outcomes of these efforts is a new course on Technical Innovation and Entrepreneurship, a cross listed course by Physics, Computer Science, and engineering. In this course students are introduced to innovation and entrepreneurial mindset through User Innovation concept, which is the focus of this report. Physics, computer science, and engineering students, as well as those majoring in communication, business, chemistry, biology, and psychology often take this as an elective course. The User Innovation module introduces Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&E) concepts in context of students' passion and their personal experience instead of using textbook definitions. Students are engaged in active learning practices that guides them through a journey, starting with User Innovation module and ending with a team project. In this process students identify needs, pains, and issues they care about, and concluding with a prototype developed through a team project that represent solutions to student defined problems. Teams project members collaboratively work on the necessary steps for launching a startup based on the team project product. They develop and submit a team project portfolio that document the challenges they faced, and their progress and achievements, while documenting how their prototype was treated to launch a startup. The success of the team project is measured by the quality of the prototype created, ability to adhere to a project timeline, quality of the written project report and documentations, the oral presentation, and the team project portfolio. Future plans include leveraging concept map to assess the impact of the whole course as well as the User Innovation module on students' perception and attitudes about entrepreneurial mindset. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.

AB  - Digital literacy skills of students in Indonesia are still very low. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of Online Laboratory Simulation with Concept Mapping and Problem-Based Learning model in improving students’ digital literacy skills. Specifically, the research objectives have been to explore the significant difference between students who learned through the PBL model, Online Laboratory Simulation with Problem-Based Learning (OLS-PBL) model, and Online Laboratory Simulation with Concept Mapping and Problem-Based Learning (OLS-CMPBL) model. It is a quasi-experimental with pre and post-test design. The population of this research is students at Islamic State School Yogyakarta (MAN), Indonesia. There were 97 students of class XI science at Islamic State School 1 (MAN 1) as participant. The main data analyses used in this study were the paired-sample t-test, comparative-descriptive analysis, and ANOVA mixed design using SPSS 24. The study reveals that (1) The OLS-CMPBL group had a significant difference in the level of digital literacy skills (sig.0000); (2) the OLS-CMPBL was the most effective model to improve the skills with a gain score of.207 (low). Learning with the OLS-CMPBL model can be an alternative for policymakers and teachers to solve the problems of digital literacy. © 2020, Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta (Yogyakarta State University).

AB  - Learning science is important for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as knowledge of science allows students to understand their natural world, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is increasingly emphasized in schools. Reading to learn science is, therefore, a vital skill in today’s schools for all students. Using a single-case reversal design, this study evaluated the effectiveness of Reading to Engage Children with Autism in Language and Literacy (RECALL; a shared reading intervention) combined with a concept map on the ability of young children with ASD to answer comprehension questions from science text. Two 5-year-old boys with ASD participated in this study. Results indicated that RECALL combined with a concept map was effective in increasing participants’ correct responding to comprehension questions from science text. Implications for intervention and research are discussed. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2019.

AB  - Conceptual change theories assume that knowledge structures grow during the learning process but also get reorganized. Yet, this reorganization process itself is hard to examine. By using concept maps, we examined the changes in students’ knowledge structures and linked it to conceptual change theory. In a longitudinal study, thirty high-achieving students (M = 14.41 years) drew concept maps at three timepoints across a teaching unit on magnetism and electrostatics. In total, 87 concept maps were analyzed using betweenness and PageRank centrality as well as a clustering algorithm. We also compared the students’ concept maps to four expert maps on the topic. Besides a growth of the knowledge network, the results indicated a reorganization, with first a fragmentation during the unit, followed by an integration of knowledge at the end of the unit. Thus, our analysis revealed that the process of conceptual change on this topic was non-linear. Moreover, the terms used in the concept maps varied in their centrality, with more abstract terms being more central and thus more important for the structure of the map. We also suggest ideas for the usage of concept maps in class. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The literature indicates that the use of mobile devices, wireless communication and sensing techniques can enhance students' learning in authentic environments and improve their learning effectiveness. Good learning strategy guides are essential for successful inquiry learning, and the question-posing strategy has been acknowledged as a type of high-level cognitive strategy that plays an important role in facilitating students' knowledge integration in the inquiry learning process. However, question posing seems challenging for many students and may lead to heavy cognitive load when appropriate scaffolding is not available. To solve this problem, the present research imported a concept mapping knowledge representation model as an auxiliary strategy for question-posing activities based on the research finding that visual knowledge representations are conducive to high-order thinking. It also developed a ubiquitous learning system which integrated multilevel concept mapping and question-posing strategy guidance to investigate the application effects of this learning model. A quasi-experimental design was applied, and an experiment was conducted to measure 5th graders’ learning of a plant unit of the natural science curriculum. Students in the experimental group learned with the proposed ubiquitous learning system based on the multilevel concept mapping and question-posing approach, while those in the control group learned with the ubiquitous learning system based on the question-posing approach. The results showed that the students in the experimental group significantly outperformed those in the control group from the perspectives of learning achievement and question-posing performance, but no significance was found in their cognitive load, meta-cognitive awareness, and science learning strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is a close relationship between chemistry and physics in the context of atomic structure, which is usually covered in both courses at the secondary-school level. However, little emphasis has been put on determining whether the students developed correct understanding of the quantum structure when they studied it in both the courses. The purpose of this study was to reveal–by using the concept mapping tool–the cognitive structures used by twelfth-grade students to understand atomic structure. One hundred forty-five students from three secondary schools in Ankara, Turkey participated in the study. The qualitative content analysis technique was employed to analyse concepts, levels of connection, and linking phrases in students’ concept maps drawn for the atom. The analysis results revealed that the students had a limited understanding of the quantum structure of the atom, even after studying the topic in chemistry and physics courses. They relied on classical ideas to understand atomic structure. The results suggest that concepts related to atomic structure should be appropriately used not only within a particular subject (e.g. physics) but also across the two subjects to help students understand the scientifically correct atomic structure. Further, several other implications for secondary-school science teaching are discussed. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Creativity has become an increasingly important competence in today's rapidly changing times. It is a central aspect of social development, but it is hardly discussed in schools and often neglected in the natural sciences. In order to promote creativity in science teaching in a targeted way, it is important to understand the perspectives and views of prospective teachers on this topic. For this purpose, a qualitative cross-sectional study was conducted with 83 German chemistry student teachers at the beginning and at the end of their study programme. We used concept maps and questionnaires to characterize changes in students' perspective on creativity in the chemistry classroom during their course of study. The quantitative analysis of the concept maps and the content analysis of student's proposition revealed similarities and differences in students' perspective on creativity between beginners and advanced student. All student teachers showed a diverse range of conceptions and views on creativity in general and in the context of chemistry education. Furthermore, almost all of the students had a positive attitude towards creativity and its integration in chemistry lessons. Although, there are no large differences in the perspective on creativity from beginner to advanced student teachers, subtle differences in students' perspectives revealed that advanced students had a more sophisticated perspective on fostering creativity in students in their prospective classrooms. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Latinos represent a critical resource of talent that could be cultivated to expand the HIV research workforce. However, their rapid growth, as the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority group in the US population, has yet to translate into a significant increase in Latino health academic researchers. Historically, strategies to build a diverse research workforce have grouped together individuals from underrepresented minority populations obscuring significance between and within group differences. This limits approaches that are responsive to the diversity of needs and experiences of emerging investigators from underrepresented groups. In this article, we discuss challenges associated with heterogeneity of Latinos and barriers that impede research independence/ career success in the context of a review of Latino-investigator targeted mentorship approaches on the behavioral-social science of HIV infection. Mentorship workforce strategies could benefit from a personalized framework emphasizing individualized and tailored approaches to address the limitations and gaps in knowledge regarding Latino research development. This perspective encourages increased emphasis on organizational and structural processes to aid in overcoming institutional-level barriers that impede research and career development. Recommendations are proposed for features and components of effective mentorship programs that will lead to robust outcomes for strengthening the Latino research workforce in the HIV research field and elsewhere. © 2020 Ethnicity and Disease, Inc..

AB  - Objective: To design, implement, and evaluate a molecular imaging elective course that would expose Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students to fundamentals of various imaging modalities and their pre-clinical and clinical applications. Methods: The “Surveys of Multi-Modality Imaging” course is a two-credit hour elective course offered to third-year PharmD and doctoral students. Experiential learning methods including active learning application-based exercises were used to supplement didactic lectures in the form of field trips (with follow-up debriefings), small group team-based tasks, hands-on demonstrations, visual modelling, gamification with problem sets, concept maps regarding given modalities, and concluding with written summary reports and formal in-class group presentations. In addition to standard course evaluations, a pre- and post-course survey were conducted to assess the students' confidence regarding course content. Results: Since its implementation in 2013, 101 students have completed the course with 72% being PharmD students (n = 73) and the remainder being doctoral students in pharmaceutical science (n = 28). Pre- and post-assessments completed by the students the last two offerings (n = 40 of a possible 43) indicated a shift in students' self-reported confidence in discussing imaging modalities from a total of 2.4% confidence (pre-course) to 97.4% confidence (post-course). Also, post-course survey indicated that 77.5% (n = 31 of 40 participants) students strongly agreed that our immersive and experiential learning activities were beneficial to overall learning for this elective. Conclusion: Students who participated in this innovative experiential learning-grounded course gained an appreciation for molecular imaging and its value and role in modern drug therapy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - For learners to be successful in an information problem solving task, they should be able to effectively regulate their own behaviour. Despite views that such behaviour may come naturally to an individual, research generally shows that some learners do experience problems with information problem solving that may stem from such things as limited prior knowledge. As a means of addressing this challenge, the authors explored how the provision of both a concept map and search tool could overcome barriers to effective information problem solving. This was explored in the current study using data collected from 111 undergraduate students who completed an information problem solving activity, wherein a concept map and search tool were provided to help them write two short essays. Through the use of event-sequence analysis and hierarchical clustering, two information problem solving strategy groups were identified (High Engagement and Low Engagement), which differed across time-on-task and essay grades. Additional analyses were undertaken to explore self-reported prior knowledge or motivation as predictors of group assignment. The findings show that even when presented with opportunities (i.e., concept map) to support effective information problem solving, not all learners will take advantage or glean the benefits of such tools. Trace data methodology is shown to be a promising approach to explore information problem solving behaviour that can overcome the limitations of solely relying upon self-report measures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Metacognition is aspect in an effort to build students' understanding of chemistry. Preliminary study conducted at SMAN 1 Banjarmasin showed that only a few students who can evaluate their learning process, so that the ability of students using metacognition in learning process is still low. The guided inquiry assisted concept map with metacognition approach is an alternative to improving students' metacognition skills in learning process. The research was carried out using classroom action research design with two cycle. Each cycle consists of planning, action, observation and reflection stages. The subjects of this study were students of XI Natural Science 5 SMAN 1 Banjarmasin with 36 students. The research data collected using metacognition skills test instrument and non test instrument. Data were analyzed with quantitative descriptive and qualitative analysis. Metacognition skills of students has increased after treatment with guided inquiry assisted concept map. The process of implementation of the action is seen from teacher and student activity. Teacher activity increased from 71, 77 to 87.94. Student activity increased to 87, 4 from beginning at 68, 16. Implementation of quided inqury assisted concept map model with metacognition approach can improve students metacognition skill, student activity and teacher activity. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Two common goals of science teacher professional development (PD) are increased content knowledge (CK) and improved readiness to teach through inquiry. However, PD assessment challenges arise when the context is structured around inquiry-based, participant-driven learning, and when the content crosses scientific disciplines. This study extended the use of concept mapping as an assessment tool for examining changes in the content knowledge of 21 high school science teachers who participated in a field-based environmental science summer institute. The scoring rubric focused on documenting concepts, links, and map organization and scope in an attempt to capture development of cross-disciplinary knowledge in ways that correspond with theories of expertise development. The analysis revealed significant gains from pre-PD to post PD maps in the sophistication of links between concepts and in the number of additional, participant-generated scientifically valid concepts. Relative to the initial maps, post PD maps also manifested more complete clustering of concepts. Findings are discussed in reference to previous studies on teachers’ learning and implications for future research using concept mapping as a means of assessing teacher PD. © 2019, © 2019 Association for Science Teacher Education.

AB  - Novakian concept mapping has been shown to offer great potential in the undergraduate science classroom as a tool to support student learning. However, a number of papers in the research literature have been less than rigorous in their application of concept mapping. This chapter highlights a number of key questions that researchers should ask themselves when embarking upon a concept mapping intervention in order to optimize the application of the tool. Firstly there needs to be clarity about the purpose of an intervention: Is it designed as a research protocol to obtain generalizable results, or is the intervention only of local interest in a unique context? This raises the question of whether the maps are research artifacts (data) or tools to support development. Secondly, we need to be clear about the type of knowledge being mapped. Is the map of agreed upon curricular knowledge for which there may be a correct response (where scoring of maps may have some utility), or is the map of “yet-to-be-known” knowledge (of personal reflections and values) where scoring would be inappropriate? Thirdly, will the initial maps provided by participants provide the data that is being sought, or will students need feedback and supportive dialogue to help increase the map quality? Finally, appreciating the ways in which the mapping relates to the philosophy of the curriculum is crucial. If the curriculum requires deep, cumulative learning as part of a collaborative learning community, then mapping is likely to be helpful. If the intention is only for individuals to memorize content, then mapping has no real part to play. By considering each of these issues before embarking upon a mapping intervention, the value of the research outputs is likely to be enhanced. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - A popular and intuitive way to capture the quality of life in cities is by evaluating ‘livability.’ This study aims to gain insight on the types, importance, and availability of skills needed to develop livable cities, as perceived by researchers and practitioners. Participants in a separate concept mapping project were asked to provide a list of the skills they found most important to the development of livable cities. Responses were synthesized into broader categories. Survey respondents most referenced Collaboration, Communication, and Community Engagement. In a second phase, respondents were asked to select those that they felt were most important. Collaboration and Community Engagement were the two most frequently selected skills in the second phase. Results were compared against competency requirements for program accreditation in the fields of Public Health, Urban Planning, Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and Parks and Recreation Administration. All are vital partners in livable city development. Further trends, similarities, and differences are discussed. This study underscores the enduring need for ‘soft skills,’ non-traditional approaches to education and workforce development, and the increasing relevance of team science. Understanding the skills needed for livable city development helps ensure researchers and practitioners are equipped to participate. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine a week-long science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) project-based learning (PBL) activity that integrates a new educational technology and the engineering design process to teach middle and high school students the concepts involved in rotational physics. The technology and teaching method described in this paper can be applied to a wide variety of STEM content areas. Design/methodology/approach: As an educational technology, the dynamic and interactive mathematical expressions (DIME) map system automatically generates an interactive, connected concept map of mathematically based concepts extracted from a portable document format textbook chapter. Over five days, students used DIME maps to engage in meaningful self-guided learning within the engineering design process and STEM PBL. Findings: Using DIME maps within a STEM PBL activity, students explored the physics behind spinning objects, proposed multiple creative designs and built a variety of spinners to meet specified criteria and constraints. Practical implications: STEM teachers can use DIME maps and STEM PBL to support their students in making connections between what they learn in the classroom and real-world scenarios. Social implications: For any classroom with computers, tablets or phones and an internet connection, DIME maps are an accessible educational technology that provides an alternative representation of knowledge for learners who are underserved by traditional methods of instruction. Originality/value: For STEM teachers and education researchers, the activity described in this paper uses advances in technology (DIME maps and slow-motion video capture on cell phones) and pedagogy (STEM PBL and the engineering design process) to enable students to engage in meaningful learning. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Concept mapping helps learners to understand complex ideas. However, studies confirming that statement are scarce. A quasi-experimental and Design-based approaches were applied to understand the effectiveness of concept mapping based teaching method on grade eight students´ conceptual lunderstanding of photosynthesis. Two sections of grade eightc onsisting of 103 students were selected randomly.Pretest results were used to assign students as experimental and control groups and treated with concept mapping and lecture methods,respectively. The post-test results of the two study groups revealed astatistically significant difference indicated that students´ treated with concept mapping method exhibited better conceptual understanding on the concept of photosynthesis than those treated with lecture method. This study suggests that science teachers should apply concept mapping method to teach science concepts systematically. The use of concept mapping method in science classes can help students to better understand the important concepts © 2020 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

AB  - Decision-making in complex environments requires a detailed understanding of causality to avoid unintended consequences and consider multiple scenarios. Concept mapping is of the key tools to support such decision-making activities. A system is abstracted as a ‘map’ or graph, in which relevant factors are represented as nodes and connected through causal links. Although studies have shown that concept maps help students recall the evidence and apply the knowledge gained to new cases, barriers such as the difficulty of assessment have prevented a wide adoption of concept maps by instructors. Previous works have partly addressed this concern by using graph algorithms to automatically assess or score a student’s map, but instructors are often more interested in correcting their students’ misconceptions than in only counting mistakes. In this paper, we design and implement a system to automatically guide students in modifying their conceptual models such that they get increasingly similar to the models produced by experts on the same problem. Although a simple automatic feedback may tell students to add/remove concepts or links based on whether they appear in the expert’s map, our approach combines expertise from systems science and participatory modeling to help students better understand why low-level changes are motivated by higher-level structures such as loops and alternative paths. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to identify and describe the key concepts of Rasch measurement theory (Rasch G, Probabilistic models for some intelligence and attainment tests. Danish Institute for Educational Research, Copenhagen. (Expanded edition, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980), 1960/1980). There have been several taxonomies describing item response theory (Kim S-H et al., A taxonomy of item response models in Psychometrika. In: Wiberg M, Culpepper S, Janssen R, Gonzáles J, Molenaar D (eds) Quantitative psychology: 83rd annual meeting of the Psychometric Society. Springer, New York City, pp 13–23, 2019; Thissen D, Steinberg L, Psychometrika 51:567–577, 1986; Wright BD, Masters GN, Rating scale analysis: Rasch measurement. MESA Press, Chicago, 1982), and this paper extends these ideas with a specific focus on Rasch measurement theory. Rasch’s measurement work reflects a key milestone in a paradigmatic shift from classical test theory to item response theory (van der Linden WJ, Handbook of item response theory, volume 1: models. CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2016). We include a categorization of measurement models that are commonly viewed as Rasch models (dichotomous, rating scale, partial credit, and many-faceted), as well as extensions of these models (mixed, multilevel, multidimensional, and explanatory models). Georg Rasch proposed a set of principles related to objectivity and invariance that reflect foundational concepts underlying science. Rasch measurement theory is the application of these foundational concepts to measurement. Concept maps provide useful didactic tools for understanding progress in measurement theory in the human sciences, and also for appreciating Rasch’s contributions to current theory and practice in psychometrics. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - The main objective of pathophysiology teaching is to facilitate the learning of mechanisms of diseases and the understanding of their expressions in patients (symptoms, signs and tests). This objective requires the application of basic biomedical science to explain the abnormalities expressed by the patients. The capacity to integrate this new organization of knowledge is essential to the understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, which explain expressions of specific diseases. Our group has a longstanding experience in the teaching of pathophysiology to medical students using problem-based learning (PBL) and concept mapping (CM). This semestral discipline has a yearly intake of 190 students, divided into 18 tutorial groups and supported by 14 tutors. The students' learning progress is evaluated by their performance during the tutorial sessions and the CM methodology has been introduced as an additional tool to visualize the integration of knowledge and how it is displayed in the different pathophysiological mechanisms. Until now, the evaluation of CM has been qualitative and used as an additional assessment tool by the tutors. The presentation will show how we are changing this approach by training the tutors and developing a scoring methodology, together with a preliminary application of the score to selected maps. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons License CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

AB  - The study focuses on the investigation of the effects of metaconceptual laboratory activities related to photosynthesis and respiration in plants on the conceptual understanding of pre-service science teachers. To this end, the current study was conducted with the participation of 34 pre-service science teachers who were taught the subjects of photosynthesis and respiration in plants through metaconceptual laboratory activities within the context of the General Biology Laboratory Applications Course, in the spring term of 2016-2017 academic year. The study employed the single-group pretest-posttest model. The data of the current study were collected by using the “Photosynthesis and Respiration in Plants Concept Test” and “open-ended questions”. The collected data were analyzed through the descriptive analysis technique. As a result of the study, it was found that the use of metaconceptual laboratory activities in biology laboratory applications enhanced the conceptual understanding of the subject of interest and resulted in the elimination of some misconceptions. In this regard, it can be suggested that during biology laboratory activities focusing on teaching of abstract and challenging concepts, students should be rendered more active by means of activities such as constructing the concept map of their metacognition, preparing posters, conducting class and group discussions about experiments and writing journals. © 2020, Hacettepe University.

AB  - The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the Remap RT (Reading – Concept Mapping – Reciprocal Teaching) learning model on low-ability students’ achievement in biology. This quasi-experimen-tal research made use of a pre-test-post-test non-equivalent control group design. The population of this research was 125 tenth-grade students from the Natural Science classes aged around 16 years old. Four classes were randomly selected as the samples, and they were divided into two groups: two classes belonged to the high ability classes, and the other two were categorised into the low ability groups. The students’ achievement was measured using an essay test. The results of the test were analysed using ANCOVA. The findings indicated that 1) students who learned using Remap RT had better academic achievement in biology than students who learned using a conventional method; 2) students with high academic ability had better academic achievement than students with low academic achievement; and 3) low-ability students who learned using Remap RT and high-ability students who learned using a conventional method had equal academic achievement. The results of the research suggest that Remap RT was effective in improving low-ability students’ achievement in biology. © 2020, University of Ljubljana. All rights reserved.

AB  - This contribution seeks to draw attention to the integrated use of different languages (graphic, visual, audio-visual…) in relation to the development of an innovative didactics. A multimodal and multimedia approach to didactics relates to the possibility to stimulate and trigger pre-knowledge adequate to the objects of learning, to develop the capacity to problematize, to foster processes of acquisition and re-elaboration of knowledge. In respect to this specific field, the results of an explorative investigation conducted in two university courses proposed by the Department of Education Sciences of the University of Bologna are presented. Indeed, within these courses, special emphasis was given to the use of visual and audio-visual languages to elicit the creation of multiple and original points of view, through activities based on encounters and sharing. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Like some other countries, seldom being sometimes addressed in classes, the Earth system approach is not emphasized enough in Portugal, nor is the interconnection between the geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. To evaluate the Earth system holistic view of a group of 8th grade (13–15 years old) Portuguese students from a public school of the north of Portugal, an improved conceptual map-based to approach Earth system was investigated. After learning about concept mapping, students were asked to collaborate in the production of four conceptual maps regarding each one of the geochemical and biogeochemical cycles, further combining these maps in a common one. Through teamwork-based task, each group was asked to establish relations between the cycles, integrated into each one of the four Earth subsystems. The final combined maps demonstrated that, in the first phase, students had some difficulties in completing the pre-designed improved maps, being more evident in the rock cycle. Contrarily, the food chain cycle revealed fewer mistakes and more appropriate terms were added. In the second phase, the students exhibited difficulties in relating the cycles to the four subsystems and the remaining cycles, drawing many arrows without any kind of connecting words. Nevertheless, in general, students have realized how to build an improved concept map but do not possess a holistic view of the Earth system. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The flow of materials and energy through society is an integral but poorly visible element of global sustainability agendas such as the Planetary Boundaries Framework and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG). Given that the primary activities of chemistry are to analyze, synthesize, and transform matter, the practice of chemistry has a great deal to contribute to sustainability science, which in turn should play an increasingly important role in reshaping the practice of chemistry. Success in integrating sustainability considerations into the practice of chemistry implies a substantial role for chemistry education to better equip students to address the sustainability of earth and societal systems. Building on the framework of the IUPAC Systems Thinking in Chemistry Education (STICE) project, we develop approaches to using systems thinking to educate students about the molecular basis of sustainability, to assist chemistry to contribute meaningfully and visibly toward the attainment of global sustainability agendas. A detailed exemplar shows how ubiquitous coverage in general chemistry courses of the Haber-Bosch process for the synthesis of ammonia could be extended using systems thinking to consider the complex interplay of this industrial process with scientific, societal, and environmental systems. Systems thinking tools such as systems thinking concept map extension (SOCME) visualizations assist in highlighting inputs, outputs, and societal consequences of this large-scale industrial process, including both intended and unintended alterations to the planetary cycle of nitrogenous compounds. Strategies for using systems thinking in chemistry education and addressing the challenges its use may bring to educators and students are discussed, and suggestions are offered for general chemistry instructors using systems thinking to educate about the molecular basis of sustainability.

AB  - Concept maps can be used in undergraduate biology as ways to visually communicate the relationships among things and events. One strength of concept mapping is that there is not just a single, correct way to compose one, given a list of particular concepts. Nevertheless there seem to be associations among ideas that are expressed frequently while teaching biology. For example, hierarchical relationships among structures and steps within processes are two common kinds of relationships that students encounter regularly. Based on our own classroom experiences and surveys of concepts appearing in two popular textbooks, we provide here a resource for composing propositions within biological concept maps. This list of more than 50 linking words and phrases is appropriate for freshman biology but can be adapted for use in more advanced courses. © 2019, Association of College and Univesity Biology Educators.

AB  - Research has shown that primary school teachers often have a poor background in science and scientific concepts, and as a consequence may feel particularly under-prepared to teach science. This study examines the effect of an intervention that investigated the knowledge and understanding of science concepts for a group of 8 first-year preservice primary teachers. The intervention consisted of engaging the participants using two technology-based resources: Omosa, a 3D game-like virtual learning environment (VLE), and Omosa NetLogo, a simulation/modelling environment. A small-N study design was used in this study to determine whether or not the intervention resulted in improving preservice teachers’ science content knowledge. Data sources included semi-structured interviews and concept maps. Overall, the findings suggest that the combination of the immersive and modelling environments facilitated and provided appropriate knowledge-building opportunities for participants by supporting their cognitive engagement. © 2019, Beijing Normal University.

AB  - Educating the next generation of physicians is a key means of communicating and disseminating impactful immunologic scientific knowledge, and its practical application to human disease. We present our perspective, using as our model a first-year medical school course entitled Host Defense. As the name suggests, immunology is the overarching principle that links the multiple subjects in the course. We address a range of immunologically relevant topics, including innate and adaptive immunity, vaccines, inflammation, allergy, tumor immunotherapy, transplantation, and autoimmunity. These topics are integrated with the fields of infectious diseases, pathology, clinical laboratory testing, and public health, to illustrate how the basic science discoveries in immunology are relevant to clinical practice. The course objectives are not only to deliver “first principles” and molecular mechanisms, but also to connect these principles with the clinical world of diagnosis and therapy. We detail the different methodologies used to achieve these objectives and to reach today's medical students. This provides a framework for course structure and execution designed to engage both the novice and the more “immunologically experienced” learner. The framework includes classical didactic components and personalized instructor access, aligned with current approaches to self-directed learning and using digital media. We also address some of the challenges of assembling a course like Host Defense in the context of an academic medical center with multiple scientific, educational, and clinical missions. This perspective is not meant be proscriptive, but rather to outline our experiences on the strategies tried, while describing their advantages and drawbacks in teaching immunology. © Copyright © 2019 Haidaris and Frelinger.

AB  - Chemical education for health profession curricula has the rigorous task of balancing chemical concepts in relation to healthcare and concepts presented on health profession graduate school admissions and/or licensing exams (such as NCLEX, nursing licensure; and MCAT, medical school admissions), often within a limited time frame. In an attempt to achieve this measure, an engaging learning activity was designed to help nursing (and a number of exercise sciences) students identify chemical education topics in published medical case studies. Student perception of the significance and practicality of this activity was examined. Three groups of students (Ntotal = 167) were provided with a number of published medical case studies and instructed to employ concept mapping techniques to "map out" how examples of four chemical education topics (analytical, biological, general, and organic) were identified in these clinical cases. The overall goal of this project is to allow students to (1) identify, (2) categorize and conceptualize, and (3) apply chemical knowledge in their present studies and overall future healthcare professions. As a result, a marked decline in course fail/pass ratios was observed. Additionally, over 80% of the students who completed the concept map activity voluntary survey highlighted their ability to identify chemistry in healthcare settings after completing the assignment. Student polling also highlighted recommendations for chemistry education in undergraduate health profession curricula, following this activity. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society

AB  - Purpose: Concept maps have been described as a valuable tool for exploring curriculum knowledge. However, less attention has been given to the use of them to visualise contested and tacit knowledge, i.e. the values and perceptions of teachers that underpin their practice. This paper aims to explore the use of concept mapping to uncover academics’ views and help them articulate their perspectives within the framework provided by the concepts of pedagogic frailty and resilience in a collaborative environment. Design/methodology/approach: Participants were a group of five colleagues within a Biochemical Science Department, working on the development of a new undergraduate curriculum. A qualitative single-case study was conducted to get some insights on how concept mapping might scaffold each step of the collaborative process. They answered the online questionnaire; their answers were “translated” into an initial expert-constructed concept map, which was offered as a starting point to articulate their views during a group session, resulting in a consensus map. Findings: Engaging with the questionnaire was useful for providing the participants with an example of an “excellent” map, sensitising them to the core concepts and the possible links between them, without imposing a high level of cognitive load. This fostered dialogue of complex ideas, introducing the potential benefits of consensus maps in team-based projects. Originality/value: An online questionnaire may facilitate the application of the pedagogic frailty model for academic development by scaling up the mapping process. The map-mediated facilitation of dialogue within teams of academics may facilitate faculty development by making explicit the underpinning values held by team members. © 2019, Joana G.

AB  - The initial and continuing training of natural science teachers should be implemented in interdisciplinary contexts. This paper shows how concept maps can generate training activities in which teachers of various disciplines can discuss macro concepts such as water, air, wind, temperature, motion, power, energy, etc. mapping the students' learning pathway. Drawing concept maps and discussing them in training sessions from the perspective of students, teachers and trainers can be a decisive professional experience in changing the ways of improving concepts representations of all the actors of classroom activities and educators. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This is an action classroom research study, with the aim of increasing learning quality through the use of illustrated handouts and concept maps. The increased learning quality is measured by using the indicator of a student's learning activity, student's learning outcomes, and teacher activity. The subjects of the research are science students in the eleventh grade of senior high school, Kupang. Data collected by using the instruments i.e. test, observation sheet and questionnaire, is analysed by descriptive qualitative and quantitative.

AB  - E-Learning has emerged as an important research area. Concept maps creation for emerging new domains such as e-Learning is even more challenging due to its ongoing development nature. For creating Concept map, concepts are extracted. Concepts are domain dependent but big data can have data from different domains. Data in different domain has different semantics. So before applying any analytics to such big unstructured data, we have to categorize the important concepts domain wise semantically before applying any machine learning algorithm. In this paper, we have used a novel approach to automatically cluster the E-Learning concept semantically; we have shown the cluster in table format. Initially, we have extracted important concepts from unstructured data followed by generation of vector space of each concept. Then we used different similarity formula to calculate fuzzy membership values of elements of vector to its corresponding concepts. Semantic Similarity is calculated between two concepts by considering repeatedly the semantic similarity or information gain between two elements of each vector. Then Semantic similarity between two concepts is calculated. Thus concept map can be generated for a particular domain. We have taken research articles as our dataset from different domains like computer science and medical domain containing articles on Cancer. A graph is generated to show that fuzzy relationship between them for all domain. Then clustering them in based on their distances. © BEIESP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of conceptual mapping on nursing students' critical thinking. METHODS: The quasi-experimental case-control study was conducted from April 2015 to October 2016 at the University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, and comprised students of Fatemeh-Zahra School of Nursing and Midwifery, Shiraz. The students were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Baseline data was collected using a two-part questionnaire, including demographic items and California Critical Thinking Skills Test. Both groups underwent 24 six-hour training sessions 3 times a week. The intervention and control groups were trained by conceptual map and integration methods, respectively. Post-intervention data was collected using the same questionnaire and was analysed using SPSS 13. RESULTS: Of the 81 subjects, 41(50.6%) were in the intervention group and 40(49.4%) in the control group. The mean age was 25.12}3.71 years in the intervention group and 25.5}4.10 years in the control group (p>0.05). At baseline, there was no significant difference between the mean critical thinking scores of the two groups (p=0.781). Postintervention values increased in both groups, but the mean critical score was significantly higher in the intervention group (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Concept mapping was found to be an effective approach for improving students' critical thinking skills.

AB  - In recent years, the flipped learning teaching model has attracted much attention. To ensure that students participate in the activities of watching instructional videos at home, it is important to design an efficient learning strategy for students to learn at home and in class. In this study, we integrate the personalization mechanism into a flipped learning 'Computer Science' course (n = 138) to improve students' engagement and learning achievements. Moreover, some studies have indicated that concept maps can help students to construct their knowledge. When students learn difficult chapters of Computer Science, they need to understand the structure. Therefore, after they have finished their personalization mechanism flipped learning, they have to draw a concept map of what they have learned on the system. More importantly, the personalization mechanism flipped learning system can record students' learning behavior and analyze it. Using the system records, we can investigate the different behaviors of the experimental group and the control group. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Network science is an emerging area of complexity science that uses mathematical techniques to study complex systems and could represent a new way of quantifying and investigating the internal structure of domain-specific knowledge as approximated by students' concept maps. Students enrolled in introductory psychology constructed concept maps to represent their understanding of a psychology chapter. Concept networks were constructed based on the concept maps generated by students. Network analysis revealed that the structure of concept networks differed across students (i.e., some networks were better connected than others), and network structure significantly predicted quiz scores, such that concept networks with larger average shortest path lengths (a network metric representing the average of the shortest paths between two nodes in a network) were associated with higher quiz scores, after controlling for network size. This paper illustrates how network science techniques can be used to quantify the conceptual structure of a learner's knowledge. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study investigates critical thinking (CT) studies in e-learning settings to provide a comprehensive analysis of CT studies. Research indexed in the Web of Science database which includes major peer-reviewed social sciences citation index journals in the e-learning field from January 2006 to November 2017 was searched for a systematic review and analysis. A total of 42 studies were selected and synthesized. The distribution of publishing years, geographical areas, education sectors, publications, disciplines, research methods, activities, CT measurement instruments, teaching instruction, the CT roles applied in the studies, and the experiment durations were reviewed. The results showed that most CT studies were conducted in nontraditional teaching environments using strategies such as online discussion or concept mapping; the most used quantitative method was the California critical thinking skills test (CCTST), whereas the most frequently adopted qualitative method was the practical inquiry model of cognitive presence (PIMCP). The common method to enhance students’ CT was online synchronous or asynchronous discussion, and the role that CT played in these studies was as a dependent variable for evaluating whether the designed e-learning instruction(s) can cultivate CT. This study concludes that with active learning instruction and experienced tutor facilitation, students’ CT could be enhanced in a variety of e-learning environments. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Education research offers strong evidence that social supports, learning interventions situated in meaningful social interaction, during learning can aid in developing interest and promote understanding for the content. However, children are often asked to complete homework tasks in isolation. To address this discrepancy, we build on prior work in social robotics to demonstrate the effectiveness of a socially adept robot, as compared to a socially neutral robot to generate situational interest and improve learning while reading a science textbook. We conducted a randomized controlled experiment (N = 63) of one reading interaction with either the socially adept or socially neutral robot. Our results show that children who read with a socially adept robot found the robot to be friendlier and more attractive, reported a higher level of closeness and mutualliking for the robot, had higher situational interest, and made more scientifically accurate statements on a concept-map activity. We discuss the practical and theoretical implications of these findings. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Background: As health care technologies continue to advance rapidly, resulting in improved standards of practice, it is essential for health care professionals to continually expand on their current skills and knowledge. We describe here an initiative to use open education resources to provide ongoing education in radiation medical sciences and imaging. Aims: The aim of this study to design an interactive, engaging, multilevel radiation medical physics resource, which is fully open to the public, and functional on all types of computing devices. Our primary target audiences are students and workers in medical radiation technology and other health care professionals as part of their continuing professional development. Design and Development: The three tasks of design, development, and content creation were most efficiently performed in parallel wherever possible. A modern responsive web design was adopted to target all desktop and mobile devices. Only open-source tools and libraries were used in developing the OpenPhys website. Overall Website Design and Navigation: The homepage is a modern tile-based design containing one coloured tile for each lesson. Clicking anywhere on a coloured lesson tile will open up a two-dimensional interactive concept map linking to content pages. Currently, 10 lessons are available online ranging from the electronic structure of the atom to MRI basics: “NMR” and “Inside a Pixel”. Lesson pages include text, images, graphics, equations, quizzes, and interactive animations. User Feedback: An online questionnaire was emailed to current radiation therapy students at the University of Alberta and alumni regarding the functionality and navigation of the website. Discussion/Conclusion: To our knowledge, OpenPhys is the first open education resource specializing in radiation physics and medical imaging. We believe OpenPhys will fill existing gaps in the realm of physics education delivery and could be a component of a blended learning initiative. Future steps will include a formal evaluation of the website and content. © 2019

AB  - We are a year into the development of a software tool for modeling and simulation (M&S) of 1D and 2D kinematics consistent with Newton’s laws of motion. Our goal has been to introduce modeling and computational thinking into learning high-school physics. There are two main contributions from an M&S perspective: (1) the use of conceptual modeling, and (2) the application of Finite State Machines (FSMs) to model physical behavior. Both of these techniques have been used by the M&S community to model high-level “soft systems” and discrete events. However, they have not been used to teach physics and represent ways in which M&S can improve physics education. We introduce the NSF-sponsored STEPP project along with its hypothesis and goals. We also describe the development of the three STEPP modules, the server architecture, the assessment plan, and the expected outcomes. © 2019 Association of Computing Machinery.

AB  - One of the key agendas for the emerging field of disciplinary-based education research is the evaluation of the trajectory of disciplinary knowledge development from novice to expert. However, with the ongoing promotion of student-centered and collaborative undergraduate science classrooms, it is unknown how peer discourse during these exercises might influence (promote or hinder) student construction of expert knowledge. This study documented the knowledge structures of n = 13 undergraduate biology students in a first semester biology course for majors across four instructional units. Participants constructed both individual and group-negotiated concept maps and map complexity, propositional stream similarity, and propositional accuracy were used as measures of quality of knowledge structure. Results indicated that on individually-constructed maps, in general, students had moderate quality knowledge structures when compared to experts. Individual map complexity seemed to increase over time, but stream similarity and propositional accuracy were more dependent on content unit. Group-constructed maps were consistently more accurate than individually-constructed maps. Results are discussed in the context of the use of collaborative concept mapping as a means to develop disciplinary expertise in biology. © 2018, © 2018 Royal Society of Biology.

AB  - The ability to categorize concepts is an essential capability for human thinking and action. On the one hand, the investigation of such abilities is the purview of psychology; on the other hand, subject-specific educational research is also of interest, as a number of research works in the field of science education show. For computer science education, no corresponding studies are currently available. However, investigating how learners build categories from a choice of given terms may be useful for several reasons; for example, learners’ perspectives on relations between terms, as well as potential misconceptions, can be detected and made available to educators aiming to improve lesson planning. Therefore, we conducted an empirical study with 490 German students from primary to higher education, in which we presented them with 23 information technology-related terms (such as computer, Facebook, hard drive, virus) on a questionnaire, with the task of assigning these to self-defined categories (and then giving their categories individual names). In the results, we identified a number of potential categorization strategies the participants might have used to categorize the given terms; these include generalization, purpose, place of use, state, part-whole relationships, and association. Recognizing and defining such categorization strategies can help teachers construct learner-adequate concept maps of the domain, which helps foster the elaboration of learners’ knowledge structures in this field. We found that the younger participants used less abstract names for their categories, and observed that some participants had difficulty categorizing some terms (such as robot and 3D). © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Concept maps are used in teaching to aid the learning process. Use of concept mapping for other purposes such as communicating course contents is not always successful for STEM courses due to complexity of subjects taught. This paper proposes a new type of maps, the course teaching map (CTM). To create a course teaching map, course elements as well as relationships between them must be represented on the map. The position of elements relative to each other is also significant. The resulting map is easy to read and convey a great deal of information, such as course learning outcomes, pre-requisite knowledge and more importantly teaching stages leading to achievement of course learning outcomes. This information and other can be easily extracted from the map even if one has little knowledge about subject. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Is science value-free? Or is it valuable only for the scientists? Does someone have ethical or moral obligations for the knowledge they have? If education is defined as a process of “teaching” knowledge, what kind of knowledge should be taught? What function does education have in regards to science? Does education have a role in determining the direction and shade of science in the future? By using philosophical critical analysis, this study describes the concept map of ethics in science, the procedure of developing ethical science, and the construction of functions and roles of education in the development of science. Science does not only have pragmatic values, but the process should also follow the applicable ethics. Science, through the actors, must be able to consider the ethical values or aspects of the development of science itself. Scientists, including educators, need not only to share scientific facts and information with the society, but also to explain the use-values, impacts, and expectations carried by science. © 2020 SERSC.

This is achieved by analysing 11 in-service geography teachers’ concept maps and in-depth interviews with qualitative data analysis. The results indicate the dominance of three terms: spatiality, phenomena and a holistic approach running through the teachers’ conceptions of geographical knowledge, skills and assessment. Geography is described by the teachers as a science which studies extensive spatial phenomena with the help of concepts and a holistic approach and in which values and students’ own lived experiences play a major role. We conclude that the in-service Finnish upper secondary teachers’ perceptions of geography are a form of powerful knowledge because they: (1) urge students to form new geographical thinking about the world, (2) give possibilities for students to study geographical phenomena and (3) evaluate their own knowledge, (4) encourage students to follow topical debates in different scales, (5) open up the students’ world views and (6) support the general objectives of Finnish upper secondary schools by applying four of the six cross-curricular themes to a great extent in teaching geography, particularly sustainable development. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The search for objective biological tests, sufficiently reliable, and predictive enough to be diagnostic of psychiatric disorders, continues apace – yet their discovery remains a distant dream. It seems increasingly unlikely that current diagnostic structures and concepts map biologically in a straight forward way – with heterogeneity within, and sharing across, existing diagnostic boundaries being the biological rule rather than the exception. Indeed, it now appears that the science of biological psychiatry is more likely to redraw those boundaries than it is to confirm and mark them (Sonuga-Barke, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2016, 57, 1). Clinical identification of childhood psychiatric disorders therefore remains, for the foreseeable future at least, an exercise in regulated social perception – reliant on the fallible and subjective judgements of parents, teachers and clinicians. Social perception of this sort is an active and motivated process and therefore prone, like all social perception, to bias and distortions – both systematic and idiosyncratic. Progress has certainly been made over the last 50 years in reducing such judgement bias by, for instance filtering perceptions through the lens of standardised instruments (questionnaires and interviews) with carefully operationalised items and a degree of reliability and validity. However, such instruments often play only a peripheral role in actual diagnostic encounters and when they are used, there is still sufficient ambiguity to leave open plenty of room for interpretation. When we acknowledge that psychiatric diagnoses are social constructions – we are not saying that symptoms of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity are not real or do not cluster together in meaningful ways or that they do not cause real distress and disability but that their interpretation and meaning are often informed by social constructs such as ethnic or gender norms and stereotypes (Meyer, Stevenson, & Sonuga-Barke, Journal of Attention Disorders, 2019). © 2019 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.

AB  - A firm definition of geography is often elusive and at times, the field is criticized for borrowing heavily from other disciplines. However, this article argues that the real strength of geography is its integrative nature. The purpose of this article is to discuss geography’s integrative nature and how this strength can be integrated into the undergraduate environmental science curriculum. Two brief examples are provided from the author’s own teaching and research experiences. Concept mapping in an introductory environmental science class allows students to visualize the complexity and integrative nature of environmental issues. In the atmospheric science classroom, students are introduced not only to the physical processes of weather hazards, but to the social dimensions as well. It is imperative that future scientists, advocates, and decision makers learn to critically integrate across disciplines to solve the world’s most pressing environmental issues.

AB  - Lately the industrial revolution era 4.0 has become a discourse in various fields. One of them is education. The education sector is the front guard of the country. In the field of education, there needs to be a plan that is structured in the making of teaching materials because teaching materials are the main learning for students. This study aims to describe and analyze teachers and students on the national curriculum teaching materials based on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The study was involving grade XI 233 senior high school students and 3 physics teachers. The method is used in this study with sequential explanatory. The research instrument used questionnaires, interviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGD). The results showed that to support STEM learning in national curriculum needed teaching materials to include lesson plans, books, animation, stimulation, and video. Components of book teaching materials include core competencies, basic competencies, indicators, objectives, concept maps, pictures, videos, animations, material that is explained in detail in each chapter, detailed discussion, internet links, summaries, and questions. The video components include core competencies, basic competencies, goals, indicators, abducting, using everyday language, complete materials and easy to understand. The material needed to develop teaching materials in physics between stationary waves, dynamic and static electricity, temperature and heat and Newton law. All teaching materials are expected to be based on e-learning or mobile learning. In the national curriculum, the teacher has not started STEM-based teaching materials. So in the future, there needs to be the development of STEM-based teaching materials to support the national curriculum that is designed to the maximum. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes and compares two categories of pedagogical design patterns that have emerged from CS education practice: lecture-based design patterns and active learning design patterns. Pedagogical design patterns provide faculty with combinations of generalized descriptions of problems and solutions that occur in teaching and learning. The benefit of forming design patterns is the codification of successful practice that can be reused in multiple scenarios and draw on the creativity of the instructor for defining the details relevant to the course and the students. Design patterns have been represented in many formats since Alexander's initial design pattern model highlighting different aspects of what is important in each domain in which the patterns are created and used. This paper analyzes design patterns emerging from recent developments in lecture-based pedagogy and active learning in CS education. Traditional lectures in computer science, engineering, and other STEM disciplines are being reconsidered due to research that shows that students are less likely to learn while listening and more likely to learn while actively engaged. Design patterns that address problems and provide potential solutions to traditional lectures in computer science education have been published that provide solutions to engage students during the lecture. The pedagogy of flipped classrooms and active learning have recently been adopted by many faculty in Computer Science leading to emerging design patterns for active learning. We compare how previously published lecture-based patterns and our active learning patterns address similar problems with different solutions to engaging students. We show how an object-based structure for pedagogical design patterns can provide additional information about the problems and the solutions addressed by the patterns that are more easily indexed and combined. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - There has been little attention given to teaching beliefs of graduate teaching assistants (GTAs), even though they represent the primary teaching workforce for undergraduate students in discussion and laboratory sections at many research universities. Secondary school education studies have shown that teaching beliefs are malleable and can be shaped by professional development, particularly for inexperienced teachers. This study characterized inexperienced GTAs’ teaching beliefs about student learning and how they change with a science-specific pedagogy course that emphasized student learning. GTA teaching beliefs were characterized as traditional (providing information to students), instructive (providing activities for students), and transitional (focusing on student-teacher relationships). At the start of the course, traditional, instructive, and transitional beliefs were emphasized comparably in the concept maps and presentations of inexperienced GTAs. At the end of the course, although GTAs’ beliefs remained mostly teacher focused, they were more instructive than traditional or transitional. GTAs included teaching strategies and jargon from the course in their concept maps but provided minimal explanations about how opportunities for active student engagement would impact student learning. These results suggest there is a need to provide ongoing discipline-specific professional development to inexperienced GTAs as they develop and strengthen their teaching beliefs about student learning. © 2019 S.

AB  - Previous research has shown that the knowledge structure (KS) complexity of a first language (L1) under certain conditions can strongly influence the KS complexity established in a second language (L2), and then this more complex L2 KS reciprocally influences L2 text comprehension. This present experimental investigation seeks to identify the unique contributions of mapping and writing in L1 (Korean) tasks to support L2 (English) science text comprehension using Pathfinder Network scaling, a graph-theoretic cognitive science approach. Native Korean low proficiency English language learners (n = 245) read a 708-word English (L2) science lesson text, completed one of seven treatment conditions, and then completed a comprehension posttest. The seven conditions consisted of three experimental conditions that required different L1 tasks including: L1 mapping alone, L1 writing alone, or both L1 mapping and writing; and four control conditions that did not receive any L1 treatment: L2 mapping alone, L2 writing alone, both L2 mapping and writing, or reading only. All of the maps and writing artifacts were converted into Pathfinder Networks that were compared to an expert’s referent network. Results show that requiring L1 lesson tasks relatively increases L2 KS complexity and concomitant comprehension posttest performance. In order of effectiveness, combined L1 mapping and writing was most effective for posttest comprehension, then L1 writing, and least effective is L1 mapping alone. These findings confirm and extend the earlier findings that the inherent L1 KS complexity can strongly influence L2 KS complexity. Educationally, requiring L1 tasks, especially in text translation, likely engenders richer L2 structure that supports higher-order understanding of the text. Also, these findings further validate this technology-based approach for measuring KS contained in bilingual learners’ productions. © 2018, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.

AB  - Is it possible to teach biology without mentioning evolution? The answer is yes, but it is not possible for students to understand biology without the evolutionary context on which the meaning and intellectual value of biological concepts depend. Meaningful learning of evolution requires (1) that the students incorporate new knowledge into a cognitive structure linked with higher-order concepts; (2) a well-organized knowledge structure; and (3) a positive emotional attachment and identification (affective commitment) to the subject by the learner. Concept maps are useful tools in meaningful learning. We present a concept map that organizes concepts of history of life and the processes that generate it, and the hierarchical relationships among them. Biological evolution is a compelling account of life on Earth and of human origins. It constitutes a unifying explanatory framework that can generate a powerful affective commitment to the subject. The concept map provided here is tied to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). © 2019 National Association of Biology Teachers.

AB  - This paper describes the design and implementation of an assessment inspired by Papert’s approach to learning. The assessment is part of a course unit called Digital Making and Learning on a masters programme in Education aimed at students with a predominantly social sciences background. The design of the assessment as part of this course is fundamentally based on Papert’s work, and maintains a ‘mathetic’ approach, focusing on the process of learning rather than a transfer of knowledge and competencies. In order to do this, an online collaborative concept-mapping tool with history-tracking functionality is adopted. The paper describes the social theory lens that informs the entire course and associated assessment design. The practical implementation of the course and how the assessment task functions as part of this learning design is explained, and finally some early evidence for the efficacy of the assessment is discussed. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - In this research, the effects of using digitally supported concept maps on the academic success of students in science classes in primary education and their opinions toward the advantages of digitally supported concept maps were examined. The research was conducted with seventh-grade students in a state school in Turkey. This research used a quasi-experimental design with two groups employing a pre-test/post-test. A total of 44 students participating in this study: Twenty-two students in the experiment group and 22 students in the control group. The control group of students experienced the concept maps using pencil and paper (manual) while the experiment used digital education materials. The data were analyzed through t-test to determine whether there was a significant difference between academic success points and then analyzed through content analysis. According to the results of the research, the students who experienced the digitally supported concept maps increased their academic success. These students reported that "learning takes place more easily" through this method. The results of this research show that the students got entertained and motivated much more in the environments that digitally supported concept maps were used. © 2019 International Council of Associations for Science Education (ICASE).

AB  - In this chapter, eight foci relevant for science educators are presented and illustrated by paradigmatic examples and discussed in two parts. The first part “from science education to practice and authorities” discusses the four foci of (1) developing concepts for instruction; (2) responding to the needs of schools; (3) connecting researchers, teachers, and stakeholders; and (4) implementing research results into practice. The second part “from practice and authorities to science education” includes a further four foci, (5) reframing recent scientific research as science content for schools, (6) considering non-formal teaching-learning processes, (7) helping to create curricular and structural changes, and (8) being aware of his/her own responsibilities. The paradigmatic examples discussed are from recent research projects in science education, for example, the development of new instruments for formative and summative assessment, the comparison of different test formats like multiple-choice problems and concept map problems, the implementation of a new interdisciplinary curricula, the development of a so-called MobiLab, and the collaboration with scientists and entrepreneurs in nanoscience. It is discussed why the foci and examples are important to researchers and educators and which lessons can be learnt. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Rich streams of fine-grained activity data are generated by many game-based learning environments. These data can be mined unobtrusively to assess student learning and potentially foster tailored feedback and scaffolding. Stealth assessment frameworks are more commonly seen in constrained virtual environments with clear goals and markers of progress; these diagnostic/formative-feedback strategies are more difficult to implement in open-ended environments with a larger range of potential activities and more variation in problem-solving strategies. This study investigates the potential for using a long short-term memory network (LSTM)-based model to enable stealth assessment in an immersive virtual world for learning. We investigate how well these temporally-sensitive models can predict learning gains on a pre-post survey, as well as predicting the quality of a student-generated concept map. This method is applied to log file data from a middle school science curriculum based on an open-ended immersive virtual environment. Results indicate that the LSTM-based model outperforms support vector machine and random forest models and can accurately predict performance without knowing pre-scores. This deep learning approach is promising for stealth assessment and formative feedback in open-ended virtual environments. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to identify conditions for the effective use of visual modeling tools that can help reduce the difficulty level of solving problems during the teaching high school students programming. Visual modeling tools are a type of software that allows you to create visual abstractions that reproduce concepts and objects of the real world with their relationships, which can help in solving the problem. In this paper, we focused on preformal models based on intellect- and concept-maps. The article gives a classification and describes techniques for using various visual modeling tools to solve problem tasks. Formed skills of working with such tools will allow students to produce, represent and express independently their knowledge. In addition, these tools allow structuring the process of solving the problem, optimizing the time for solving each stage of solving a problem task. The article presents the results of comparing the learning outcomes of the control and experimental groups, which show that the proposed visual modeling tools can help in solving the programming problem tasks. © 2019 16th International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in Digital Age, CELDA 2019.

AB  - The collection and selection of the data used in learning analytics applications deserve more attention. Optimally, selection of data should be guided by pedagogical purposes instead of data availability. Using design science research methodology, we designed an artifact to collect time-series data on students’ self-regulated learning and conceptual thinking. Our artifact combines curriculum data, concept mapping, and structured learning diaries. We evaluated the artifact in a case study, verifying that it provides relevant data, requires a limited amount of effort from students, and works in different educational contexts. Combined with learning analytics applications and interventions, our artifact provides possibilities to add value for students, teachers, and academic leaders. © 2019, UTS ePRESS.

AB  - In this paper, the authors describe the preliminary results of an on-going project consisting in the design of a textbook for English for Specific Purposes (ESP) to be used as support for students in several areas of the Life Sciences (Agriculture, Biology, Genetic Engineering, Horticulture, etc.). A case study was undertaken with students on a tertiary level (1st and 4th year students), which included collaborative learner-teacher activities, including the construction of concept maps based on keywords, the results of which are being considered for inclusion in the final textbook. The object of this study is to assess the opportunity of collecting feedback from learners with a view to including it in the textbook design, as well as materials collaboratively chosen and designed by the authors together with students. For this purpose, the research is supported by a conceptual methodological approach having an exploratory objective. The question raised in this study is answered by following a review of the literature related to some major key concepts to be acquired, as well as empirical observations of our ESP classes for the purpose of gathering relevant data from learners, followed by an analysis and discussion of the collected data. This analysis serves as preliminary considerations for our textbook focusing on feedback from the students, while also being a presentation of our outlook on the ESP course upheld for discussion. © 2019, Faculty of Engineering, University of Kragujevac.

AB  - The paper presents the follow-up of a case study investigation with students of ESP (English for Specific Purposes) on a tertiary level (1st and 4th year students), consisting of collaborative learner-teacher activities, including concept mapping and content-based learning. The results of our project in progress are considered for an optimal adaptation of an ESP textbook which is intended for students in several areas related to the Life Sciences (Agriculture, Biotechnologies, Biology, Genetic Engineering, Horticulture, etc.). The framework of the course support we propose, as well as our methodology and tool kit are provided by ecolinguistics and the aim is achieving ecological learning and meaningful communication in the language class and beyond. The object of this exploratory study is to highlight the potential of collaborative learning environments, to enable students to employ conceptual mapping and find relations between significant concepts in the Life Sciences. The feedback was collected from ESP learners as materials were collaboratively selected and designed together with students, based on the construction of conceptual maps. The question raised in our preliminary study draws on a review of the literature pertinent to meaningful conceptual learning. Some of the key concepts addressed in the ecologically-designed English courses are analysed, focusing on feedback from the students and constantly adapting our findings to better serve their needs. © 2019, Centar for Quality.

AB  - In this study, researching the effect of a planned trip to one of the informal learning environments, zoos, on learning and taking students’ opinions about the trip were aimed. The working group consists of 15 fifth grade students. The Experimental method was used in this research. The academic achievement test developed by the researcher was applied to the students before and after the trip to determine the effect of the planned zoo trip on the students’ learning. To determine the change in students’ misconceptions, concept maps were drawn before and after the trip. For the students’ views about this learning experience, a semi-structured interview form was used. Pre and posttest results gotten from the achievement test were evaluated with Wilcoxon signed ranks test; the data obtained from the concept maps were analyzed with error frequencies, and the students’ judgments received from a semi-structured interview about this learning experience were examined with content analysis method. Results of the research showed that a well-organized zoo trip has a positive effect on learning; that there is a meaningful difference between students’ pretest and posttest academic achievement scores for the benefit of posttest; that it does not have any effect on misconceptions about general classification, however, it is effective on, more specifically, misconceptions about animal classification. Students have found this trip entertaining and informative. © 2019, Ankara University. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this chapter is to show how several instructional strategies were incorporated into a senior-level forensic chemistry course, and how the strategies work together in a complementary fashion. Implementing a flipped classroom model allowed for class time to be used for team-based learning such as projects, activities, and quizzes. Class time was also used for instruction on and the exploration of generative learning strategies such as concept maps, drawing activities, practice testing, and summarizing activities. Generative learning strategies have been shown to promote the generalization and transfer of knowledge. The generative learning activities were designed in a way to help students understand the importance of constructing and interpreting information outside of class time as they study. These generative strategies were then used by students to complete weekly prelecture assignments. These instructional strategies were chosen in an attempt to maximize student engagement in the process of learning. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The intentional omission of learning outcomes from the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education has caused concern and criticism from some librarians; however, the call to action within the Framework to locally develop learning outcomes is an opportunity to illuminate the social justice, critical thinking, and higher order thinking elements of information literacy. This study applies the transformative research paradigm using the methodology of concept mapping to test the development of learning outcomes for one of the frames. Concept mapping is a mixed-methods approach and includes focus groups, hierarchical cluster analysis, and multidimensional scaling. The methodology has been used extensively in the social sciences but has limited representation in the LIS literature. Though the study provides learning outcomes developed by a small participant group following the concept mapping method, the results demonstrate the viability of this methodology for librarians seeking a new approach to locally develop learning outcomes. © 2019, Communications in Information Literacy.

AB  - The current research investigated Grade 5 students’ reflective discourse during their co-design of an ecological concept map as a way to assess collaborative knowledge building. The result showed that students sustainably built on each other’s ideas and inquiries about various ecological concepts to advance their scientific knowledge as a community. They also incorporated more academic and ecological terms as they participated in the co-designing activity. This study illustrated the potential use of the collective concept mapping to collaboratively advance knowledge in science disciplines as the student-driven reflective assessment. © ISLS.

AB  - Planning, implementation, and evaluation of multicomponent, case-based learning for first-year Indian medical undergraduates. Adv Physiol Educ 43: 504-511, 2019; doi:10.1152/advan.00080.2019.-Didactic lecture is an effective method to quickly pass on a high volume of information to a large number of students. However, if not well designed, lectures can be monotonous and provide only passive learning, with little scope for higher order learning skills. To address this drawback of lectures, we supplemented it with case-based learning (CBL), which has been shown to promote self-learning. After giving an overview of gastrointestinal physiology through lectures, CBL on peptic ulcer disease was implemented for first-year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery students. The present study aimed to evaluate the students' and teachers' opinions on the notion of supplementing lectures with CBL. In previous reports, discussion using clinical cases was primarily employed as the solitary component for conducting CBL. In the present study, three different but mutually exclusive components, such as case discussion, concept map, and critical thinking exercise on a specific topic in gastrointestinal pathophysiology, were integrated to form the multicomponent CBL (MC-CBL). Students reported that MC-CBL could promote application of the knowledge learned in lectures in a more appropriate context (92.42% positive response), enhance their learning efficiency (98.46% positive response), promote their active participation in the learning process (98.48% positive response), and help them in integrating physiological concepts with clinical science (98.46% positive response). Teachers observed that MC-CBL could promote active learning, analytic, and problemsolving skills of students. In conclusion, MC-CBL appeared to be an effective supplement for the lectures, providing an opportunity for the students to relate the knowledge learned during lectures. © 2019 The American Physiological Society.

AB  - s play the pivotal role of selling an article to a prospective reader, and for students, the ability to communicate science in concise written form may foster scientific thinking. However, students struggle with abstract composition, and we lack evidence-based educational innovations to help them develop this skill. We designed, implemented, and assessed an intervention for abstract composition with elements of scaffolding and transparency to ask whether deliberate practice improves concise scientific writing in early career undergraduate biology majors. We evaluated student performance by analyzing abstracts written before and after the intervention and by assessing pre- and posttest student concept maps. We found that scaffolded learning improved student abstract writing, with the greatest gains in students’ ability to describe the motivation for their work. Using a set of tested tools to teach scientific writing has important implications for strengthening students’ capacity to reinforce and synthesize content in the future, whether that is in laboratory course exercises, in independent research, or as a transferable skill to general critical thinking. ©2018 Author(s).

AB  - Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have deleterious effects on health across the lifespan. Educating health professionals for ACEs awareness and prevention facilitates quality care. Literature documents concept mapping as an effective teaching strategy used in health professions to stimulate learning and foster students’ critical thinking. However, ACEs curricular concept mapping remains unexplored. Method: Content analysis with manifest coding was used to identify key concepts based on faculty narratives and discussion notes about ACEs content. Results: Major and minor themes emerged to support the ACEs Curricular Concept Map development with direct and indirect paths to culture of health and health equity. Conclusions: The ACEs Curricular Concept Map was developed to guide teaching ACEs knowledge in a Bachelor of Science in Nursing program. Future studies are needed to evaluate the impact of ACEs curricular concepts on nursing students’ learning and graduates’ ability to translate knowledge to practice ACEs awareness and prevention toward health equity for all. © SLACK Incorporated.

AB  - All actions are result of scenarios. While we analyze different information pieces and their relationships, we notice that actions drive intents and intents drive actions. These relationships among intents and actions can decode the reasoning behind action selection. In the similar way, in stories, news and even email exchanges these relationships are evident. These relationships can allow us to formulate a sequence of mails irrespective of change in subject and matter. The continuity among concepts, drift of concepts, and then reestablishing of original concepts in conversation, email exchanges, or even series of events is necessary to establish relationships among various artifacts. This paper proposes a multi-edge fuzzy graph-based adversarial concept mapping to resolve this issue. Instead of peaks, this technique tries to map different valleys in concept flow. The transition index between prominent valleys helps to decide your order of that particular leg. The paper further proposes a technique to minimize this using fuzzy graph. The fuzziness in graph represents the fuzzy relationships among concepts. The association among multiple such graphs helps to represent the overall concept flow. The dynamic concept flow represents the overall concept flow across the documents. This algorithm and representation can be very useful to represent lengthy documents with multiple references. This approach can be used to solve many real-life problems like news compilation, legal case relevance detection, and associating assorted news from the period under purview. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Formative assessment is an exercise meant to enrich teaching-learning process. These methods are used to conduct in-process evaluations of student understanding, learning needs, and academic growth during a course. Formative assessments in engineering course are mostly implemented as assignments, multiple choice question, tests etc. Such methods are not engaging, motivating and does not give instant feedback to teachers to make necessary adjustments to modules and delivery techniques, and academic support. Wireless communication is one of the core telecommunication course which consists of students from computer science, mechanical and electronics engineering. In this course we have implemented two techniques: i) crossword puzzle, ii) concept maps in classroom. In this paper, we report the usage of these two methods as formative assessment techniques as we believe that they can evoke high level of engagement, recall, and retention. Though we have not yet conducted controlled studies for effectiveness evaluation of these formative assessment techniques, feedback response from student's reveals that 78% find the techniques engaging. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Concept maps, which are network-like visualisations of the inter-linkages between concepts, are used in teaching and learning as representations of students’ understanding of conceptual knowledge and its relational structure. In science education, research on the uses of concept maps has focused much attention on finding methods to identify key concepts that are of the most importance either in supporting or being supported by other concepts in the network. Here we propose a method based on network analysis to examine students’ representations of the relational structure of physics concepts in the form of concept maps. We suggest how the key concepts and their epistemic support can be identified through focusing on the pathways along which the information is passed from one node to another. Towards this end, concept maps are analysed as directed and weighted networks, where nodes are concepts and links represent different types of connections between concepts, and where each link is assumed to provide epistemic support to the node it is connected to. The notion of key concept can then be operationalised through the directed flow of information from one node to another in terms of communicability between the nodes, separately for out-going and in-coming weighted links. Here we analyse a collated concept network based on a sample of 12 original concept maps constructed by university students. We show that communicability is a simple and reliable way to identify the key concepts and examine their epistemic justification within the collated network. The communicabilities of the key nodes in the collated network are compared with communicabilities averaged over the set of 12 individual concept maps. The comparison shows the collated network contains an extensive set of key concepts with good epistemic support. Every individual networks contain a sub-set of these key concepts but with a limited overlap of the sub-sets with other individual networks. The epistemically well substantiated knowledge is thus sparsely distributed over the 12 individual networks. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - In K-12 education in the USA, teachers are typically trained to work in content area silos. This structure shapes how teacher certification is organized as well. Biology, chemistry, economics, and urban planning are each considered distinct disciplines. Although there are some benefits to this approach in terms of focus and scope, there are also limits. Deeply integrated topics such as water resilience require a more unified and interdisciplinary pedagogical approach. This paper describes work done to train new science teachers to utilize systems and network models through the use of concept mapping to reconstruct their thinking and understanding of such topics. These teachers were then asked to create appropriate unit and lesson plans that reflected these system and network models. Preliminary findings suggest that educators who participated in this training were better able to teach deeply integrated topics to their K-12 students in more meaningful and productive ways. © 2018, AESS.

AB  - In this paper, we present and discuss the results of a systematic review of concept mapping-based interventions in primary and secondary science education. We identified the following recommendations for science educators on how to successfully apply concept mapping as a method for formative assessment: firstly, concept mapping should be constructed in teaching, preferably on repeated occasions. Secondly, concept mapping should be carried out individually if personal understanding is to be elicited; however, collaborative concept mapping might foster discussions valuable for developing students’ understanding and for activating them as instructional resources and owners of their own learning. Thirdly, low-directed mapping seems most suitable for formative assessment. Fourthly, technology-based or peer assessments are useful strategies likely to reduce the load of interpretation for the educator and are compatible with timely feedback. Finally, elaboration should be part of the feedback, activating students as the owners of their own learning. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the implementation of Multiple Intelligences (MI) combined with map concept and portfolio assessment to improve classroom atmosphere and nutrition students' performance in learning nutrition care process (NCP). Methods: An individual action research project was implemented in the subject of basic dietetics involving 51 undergraduate nutrition students at the Department of Nutrition Science, Faculty of Health Science Universitas Muhammadiyah Surakarta, Indonesia. Results: Findings indicated that all students enjoyed the lectures; about 91% of them actively participated in the class; and more than half of the students were found to be more creative in completing the dietetics tasks. The assumption of most students that the subject of dietetics is scourge and difficult, turned into an exciting, relaxed but serious and easy to understand tasks, because students could learn using their own intelligence. The map concept and portfolio assessment trained students to be more thorough and disciplined in doing NCP. The average score of students' achievements at the end of semester indicated a very satisfactory category. © 2018 The authors and IJLTER.ORG. All rights reserved.

AB  - The production of a computer program requires learners to be skilled in basic concepts of programming, to master mathematical formulas, appropriate syntax usage, and in-depth knowledge of programming languages. Typically, in forming a program, students should be able to identify problems, generate algorithms, and convert algorithms into program code according to the syntax. Therefore, a Java programming course requires a student to master cognitive thinking in which, students can recover knowledge by using 'retrieval-based learning' as a basic recollection strategy in learning programming languages. The retrieval-based learning method refers to the following five waves: mnemonic, semantic, episodic context account, map concept, and quiz. Through these five waves, students should be able to implement retrieval method such as producing their own practice questions, quizzes, scan cards, to rewrite learning, repainting of learning, and concept maps. Instructional materials should include formative (topical) assessment, emphasis on text and content requirements, use of open-ended questions (subjective), answers or feedback, repeating exercises, and student achievement estimation. The main contribution is to create a descriptive Java programming lesson, which includes the choice of difficult topics, learning activities, teaching and learning modules, and online learning. However, the initial purpose of this study is to determine the most difficult topics in Java programming, the retrieval based learning used by students, as well as online student learning modules among students in Diploma of Computer Science (Programming) in vocational colleges. The instrument used to collect the data is through an online questionnaire and the findings were analysed using SPSS software by giving the percentage value for each element studied. The sample of the study was 110 students in Diploma of Computer Science (Programming) from four vocational colleges in Malaysia. The findings from the preliminary study conducted by the researcher are presented in detail in this paper. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate student perceptions of collaborative concept mapping exercises in an image acquisition and technical evaluation course. Methods First-year radiologic technology students worked collaboratively throughout the semester to create concept maps for receptor exposure, contrast, spatial resolution, and distortion. They completed a survey at the end of the course that detailed whether the maps were helpful for learning and understanding the content. Results The majority (90%) of the student participants responded favorably to the concept mapping activity, saying the maps were helpful for learning how certain technical factors affect image quality. In addition, 85% of the participants thought concept maps should be used in future radiologic technology courses. Discussion Although this pilot study was limited by its small sample size, students' favorable results suggest that concept mapping is a valuable instructional tool in helping students learn image evaluation principles and therefore warrants a larger-scale investigation. Conclusion Additional research is warranted to address the use of concept maps in other radiologic science content areas. © 2018 American Society of Radiologic Technologists.

AB  - The use of external representations has a potential to facilitate inquiry learning, especially in hypothesis generation and scientific reasoning, which are typical difficulties encountered by students. This study proposes and investigates the effects of a three-dimensional thinking graph (3DTG) that allows learners to combine in a single image, problem information, subject knowledge (key concepts and their relationships), and the hypothesizing and reasoning process involved in exploring a problem, to support inquiry learning. Two classes of eleventh grade students (97 in total) were randomly assigned to use either the 3DTG (i.e., experimental condition) or concept map (i.e., control condition) to complete a group-based inquiry task in an online environment. Data were collected from multiple data sources, including measures of group inquiry task performance, postknowledge scores, postquestionnaires of student perceptions of consensus building, and open-ended survey. The analysis of group task performance revealed that participants in the experimental condition performed better in the inquiry task than their counterparts specifically in generating hypotheses and reasoning with data, but not in drawing conclusions. The findings show the 3DTG's benefits in facilitating exploring and justifying hypotheses, and also suggest that the 3DTG can share equal value with concept mapping in terms of drawing conclusions and consensus building. In addition, students using the 3DTG achieved higher scores in the postknowledge test, although no difference was found in their perceptions of consensus building. These findings were validated by students' responses to the survey. Implications of this study and future work are also discussed. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: In today's society, few adolescents meet physical activity guidelines and effects of physical activity promoting programmes are disappointing. In studies exploring determinants of physical activity, the perspective of adolescents themselves is largely lacking. Also, there is a lack of knowledge on potential environmental determinants of adolescent physical activity. Therefore, this study aimed to explore adolescents' perspectives on characteristics of an activity-friendly environment. Methods: Concept mapping meetings were conducted with four secondary school classes, including 115 adolescents (13-17 years). Each student generated ideas regarding the characteristics of an activity-friendly environment. For each school class, ideas were combined and identical ideas were removed. Next, students individually sorted all ideas, based on self-perceived similarity, and rated their importance on a five-point Likert-scale. A concept map was created for each school class using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis. Finally, the researchers named the potential environmental determinants within the clusters. Results: The concept maps depicted 23 unique potential determinants of activity friendliness, of which 15 were similar across all school classes. Potential determinants were categorized in the physical-, social-, economic-, and motivational domain. The most frequent and important adolescent-perceived determinants of activity friendliness across all school classes belonged to the physical domain, e.g. a suitable area including a proper surface for a variety of sports, and good lighting in the playground. Conclusions: Our findings show that adolescents perceive potential determinants in the physical and economic domain as most important for activity friendliness, indicating that future interventions might benefit from targeting potential determinants within these domains. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Concept mapping is an important tool used in science learning to help students construct understanding about fundamental concepts and how they are related. The EcoXPT research project has the goal of supporting authentic experiment-based inquiry within an immersive virtual world curriculum for middle school ecosystem science. It builds on prior research with the EcoMUVE curriculum, which includes, as a culminating activity, student teams creating hand-drawn concept maps to represent their hypotheses about the causal relationships in a virtual ecosystem. As part of the initial Design-Based Research phase of EcoXPT, researchers developed a new electronic concept mapping tool which was piloted with the EcoMUVE curriculum. This study looks at differences in concept maps drawn by student teams based on whether they were given access to the new concept-mapping tool. The findings provide insight into the impact of concept map scaffolding choices, and inform the design of future versions of the tool. © 2018

AB  - This article argues that the development of rap song lyrics or lyrical concept mapping can be a viable pedagogical alternative to the development of concept maps as a means to reinforce STEM vocabulary. Hip-hop pedagogy is a culturally responsive pedagogy that leverages the funds of knowledge acquired from hip-hop culture. Unfortunately, many students with strong hip-hop cultural identities may lack equally strong mathematics identities. Given the success of hip-hop pedagogies within the science content area, we posit that hip-hop pedagogies are appropriate in other STEM content areas such as mathematics. Concept mapping is an instructional tool that has been empirically validated as an effective means to develop strong conceptualizations of mathematics content. While hip-hop pedagogy is well established in the science content area, it remains underdeveloped within mathematics education. We argue that the lyrical structure of a rap song is fundamentally similar to the structure of a concept map. This article provides a framework to support lyrical concept mapping as a culturally responsive instructional tool that can be used as an alternative to traditional concept mapping. Special attention is placed on the use of hip-hop pedagogy to affirm and empower dually marginalized students. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Student interaction at a whole-class level is tied to learning outcomes, but encouraging students to engage with their peers at a whole-class level is difficult. While little research has sought to promote student engagement with one another at this level, one factor that has been shown to increase student interaction in pairs and small groups is student–student interdependency. Yet, to date, no studies have attempted to examine the impact of prior interdependency at this smaller scale on students’ interactions as a whole-class. The current study tested this relationship in an undergraduate class learning science content (n = 19) through structuring interdependency (task and resource) during science learning. Students completed six science learning sessions each of which included a science learning activity followed by a whole-class concept mapping task. Students were audio and video recorded during the whole-class task, and then individual student behavior was coded in 10 s intervals during the first 10 min of each session. Generalized regression results showed that adding small group interdependency during learning predicted significantly more student science discussion (R2 =.05) and supportive interactions (R2 =.16), while predicting decreased expressions of science misunderstanding (R2 =.07) during the whole-class task. Additionally, the combination of task and resource interdependency predicted a further decrease in student expressions of misunderstanding (R2 =.07), but also increased student social distraction in comparison to task interdependency alone (R2 =.28). Together these findings suggest that prior interdependency can be leveraged to increase student behavioral engagement at the whole-class level. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to introduce a case-based module teaching sustainable engineering, linking the Envision rating system with behavioral decision science. Three complete modules are publicly available in a repository for any instructor to adapt, use and review. Design/methodology/approach: A case study was written about the Tucannon River Wind Farm, a project-certified Gold by the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure’s Envision™ rating system. The case was used as the basis for an in-class PowerPoint module to achieve student learning outcomes related to sustainability. Findings: Before and after surveys showed significant (p < 0.05) learning increases. Word clouds show changes in student perceptions of sustainable design. Rubric scoring of writing assignments and concept maps yielded valuable insights and improvements and demonstrated the overall validity of the module approach. Research limitations/implications: Modules lasting only one or two class days must be well-integrated into courses and curricula to promote greater learning value. Concept mapping may be a useful addition but involves a learning curve for both instructors and students. Practical implications: By offering instructors access to a set of case-based modules, it becomes more practical for them to teach about sustainable infrastructure and decision-making. Social implications: The module exemplifies a project owner and an engineering firm strongly committed to social and environmental sustainability. Envision’s Quality of Life and Leadership categories emphasize community well-being, involvement and collaboration. Originality/value: This module offers a unique transdisciplinary focus meeting several needs in engineering education on sustainability, complex problems and decision-making. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In computer science, students could benefit from exposure to critical programming concepts from multiple perspectives. Peer review is one method to allow students to experience authentic uses of the concepts in an activity that is not itself programming. In this work, we examine how to implement the peer review process in early, object-oriented computer science courses as a way to increase the students' knowledge of programming concepts, specifically Abstraction, Decomposition, and Encapsulation, and to develop their higher-level thinking skills. We are exploring the peer review process, the effects of the type of review on the reviewers, and the results this has on the students' learning. To study these ideas, we used peer review activities in CS2 classes at two universities over the course of a semester. Using three groups (one reviewing their peers, one reviewing the instructor, and one completing small design or coding assignments), we measured the students' conceptual understanding throughout the semester with concept maps and the reviews they completed. We found that reviewing helped students learn Decomposition, especially those reviewing the instructor's programs, but we did not find that it improved the students' level of thinking. Overall, reviews (peer or otherwise) are beneficial for teaching Decomposition to CS2 students and can be used as an alternative method for teaching other object-oriented programming concepts. © 2018 ACM 1946-6226/2018/09-ART13 $15.00

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine changes in the quality of science teachers’ argumentation as a result of their engagement in a teacher workshop on earthquake engineering emphasizing distributed learning approaches, which included concept mapping, collaborative game playing, and group lesson planning. The participants were ten high school science teachers from US high schools who elected to attend the workshop. To begin and end the teacher workshop, teachers in small groups engaged in concept mapping exercises with other teachers. Researchers audio-recorded individual teachers’ argumentative statements about the inclusion of earthquake engineering concepts in their concept maps, which were then analyzed to reveal the quality of teachers’ argumentation. Toulmin’s argumentation model formed the framework for designing a classification schema to analyze the quality of participants’ argumentative statements. While the analysis of differences in pre- and post-workshop concept mapping exercises revealed that the number of argumentative statements did not change significantly, the quality of participants’ argumentation did increase significantly. As these differences occurred concurrently with distributed learning approaches used throughout the workshop, these results provide evidence to support distributed learning approaches in professional development workshop activities to increase the quality of science teachers’ argumentation. Additionally, these results support the use of concept mapping as a cognitive scaffold to organize participants’ knowledge, facilitate the presentation of argumentation, and as a research tool for providing evidence of teachers’ argumentation skills. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments provide learners with multiple representational tools for storing, sharing, and constructing knowledge. However, little is known about how learners organize knowledge through multiple representations about complex socioscientific issues. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate learners’ knowledge organization (KO) through multiple representations in a CSCL environment. We designed a learning unit on nuclear energy and implemented it with a group of 20 college students. The participants used a web-based hypertext KO platform that incorporated three representational modes: textual, pictorial, and concept map. The platform interlinked learners’ knowledge entries based on similar keywords. Utilizing mixed methods research we analyzed the individual entries and the knowledge base to determine KO both at the individual and the collective levels. We found that the density of the knowledge base was high; the learners mostly benefited from their text- and concept map-based entries, though the picture-based entries were also an important means for connecting entries with similar content and hence creating a dense knowledge base. Our results suggest that KO with multiple representations can create a more comprehensive knowledge base. Using distinct analytical approaches will allow CSCL researchers to better identify KO both at the individual and collective levels. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Learner-centered pedagogical methods that are based on clinical application of basic science concepts through active learning and problem solving are shown to be effective for improving knowledge retention. As the clinical relevance of biochemistry is not always apparent to health-profession students, effective teaching of medical biochemistry should highlight the implications of biochemical concepts in pathology, minimize memorization, and make the concepts memorable for long-term retention. Here, we report the creation and successful implementation of a flipped jigsaw activity that was developed to stimulate interest in learning biochemistry among medical students. The activity combined the elements of a flipped classroom for learning concepts followed by a jigsaw activity to retrieve these concepts by solving clinical cases, answering case-based questions, and creating concept maps. The students' reception of the activity was very positive. They commented that the activity provided them an opportunity to review and synthesize information, helped to gage their learning by applying this information and work with peers. Students' improved performance especially for answering the comprehension-based questions correctly in the postquiz as well as the depth of information included in the postquiz concept maps suggested that the activity helped them to understand how different clinical scenarios develop owing to deviations in basic biochemical pathways. Although this activity was created for medical students, the format of this activity can also be useful for other health-professional students as well as undergraduate and graduate students. © 2018 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46:343–353, 2018. © 2018 The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

AB  - Across disciplines, it is common practice to bring together groups to solve complex problems. Facilitators are often asked to help groups organize information about and better understand the problem in order to develop and prioritize solutions. However, despite existence of several methods to elicit and characterize how individuals and groups think about and conceptualize an issue, many are difficult to implement in practice-based settings where resources such as technology and participant time are limited and research questions shift over time. This paper describes an easy-to-implement diagramming technique for eliciting conceptualization and a flexible network analysis method for characterizing changes in both individual and group conceptualization. We use a case example to illustrate how we used the methods to evaluate African American adolescent's conceptual understanding of obesity before and after participating in a series of four systems thinking workshops. The methods produced results that were sensitive to changes in conceptualization that were likely driven by the specific activities employed during the workshop sessions. The methods appear strong for capturing salient levels of conceptualization at both individual and collective levels. The paper concludes with a critical examination of strengths and weaknesses of the methods and implications for future practice and research. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A concept map is a node-link diagram in which each node represents a concept and each link identifies the relationship between the two concepts it connects. We investigated how using concept maps influences learning by synthesizing the results of 142 independent effect sizes (n = 11,814). A random-effects model meta-analysis revealed that learning with concept and knowledge maps produced a moderate, statistically significant effect (g = 0.58, p < 0.001). A moderator analysis revealed that creating concept maps (g = 0.72, p < 0.001) was associated with greater benefit relative to respective comparison conditions than studying concept maps (g = 0.43, p < 0.001). Additional moderator analyses indicated learning with concept maps was superior to other instructional comparison conditions, and was effective across science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and non-STEM knowledge domains. Further moderator analyses, as well as implications for theory and practice, are provided. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Situational case-based teaching is one of promising teaching strategies in engineering education, e.g., computer science and information security. This strategy is student-centered and can reinforce practical experience and context-aware problem solving. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework by applying concept mapping to address the great concern of comparing different teaching strategies. Specifically, the proposed evaluation framework consists of four phases, i.e., concept map construction, concept map converting, multidimensional scaling and clustering analysis. The evaluating results based on concept mapping over a demo course reveal the following two statements: (a) Situational cases can help learners learn important concepts and organize their relationships with the goal of practical problem solving in engineering courses; (b) Compared with the conventional lecture strategy, the situational case-based one is helpful for learners to achieve high-level cognitive outcomes, e.g., antagonistic thinking. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - The goal of care mapping in the clinical setting in undergraduate nursing education is to determine the student's ability to collect, present, and connect relevant data points in order to evaluate and understand the medical plan of care and to develop a priority based nursing plan of care. This same process can be utilized across all health science education programs. The purpose of this chapter is to share how the author has modified the traditional concept map tool to a more user friendly format and to present a process of implementation that may be used in the clinical setting as part of any undergraduate health science program. The benefits of such an implementation are that of more enriched learning to include the development of critical thinking skills, the use of a common sense approach, and the recognition of the patient as a holistic being. © 2018, IGI Global.

AB  - Ontology is the study of groups or classes of things. It is a classification of concepts in a domain. Domain Ontology represents the concepts which belong to part of the world. Ontology along with set of individual instances of classes constitutes a knowledge base. In this paper, Domain Ontology of Computer Graphics is prepared using subject-predicate-object representation, where subject is a class or instance, predicate is property of class or instance and object is values of properties. This Ontology is then used for subjective evaluation of answers submitted by students in examinations. The statistical techniques, namely Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), Generalized Latent Semantic Analysis (GLSA), Maximum Entropy, and Hybrid Technique based on LSA and BLEU are used for performing evaluation of student answer along with Ontology. When the students' answers are to be evaluated, the details related to the concept are fetched from the Ontology. The point of access is provided by human examiner. When short questions are to be answered, then directly related information is fetched. When longer questions are to be answered, then more details are fetched using Ontology property, instances, and subclasses. After performing preprocessing, the students' answers are given as input along with subject-specific Ontology to statistical techniques. The sentences in each student answer are classified as belonging to an Ontology concept using statistical techniques. Then, total number of concepts found in each answer is divided by total number of concepts in concept map to generate the similarity score between concept map and student answer. The development and implementation of Ontology-based evaluation involve: development of Ontology, extraction of Ontology from RDF file, and implementation of statistical techniques in Java Programming Language. The Ontology is implemented with the help of Protégé tool. The developed application is tested using 10 questions of Computer Graphics. The techniques are tested both with and without Ontology. The OHYBRID technique shows the best correlation as compared to all other techniques. Maximum Entropy has correlation varying from 0.61 to 0.96. There is a lot of improvement in Maximum Entropy with Ontology. GLSA Ngram 1 and 2 do not show much improvement with use of Ontology as correlation varies from 0.44 to 0.87 for NGRAM1 and 0.41 to 0.84 from NGRAM2. The performance of the Ontology-based evaluation is compared with evaluation without Ontology. It is found that with use of Ontology the performance is more streamlined as individual feedback can be given to students. The feedback includes the concepts that are missing in student answer which is more near to human-like evaluation. It is concluded that use of Ontology makes the evaluation more thorough and near to accurate. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we analyze the effects of the type of collaborative task (elaboration of concept map vs elaboration of expository summary) on the performance and on the level of collaboration achieved by Mexican university students in the multimedia learning of a social sciences content (Communication Psychology). Likewise, the processes of social regulation that are put into play in these collaborative tasks are described. Forty-five students (17 women and 28 men) grouped in 15 triads participated in the study. Each triad was assigned to one of the two collaborative conditions: elaboration of concept map (8 groups) and elaboration of an expository summary (7 groups). It was monitored that there were no significant previous differences between two conditions regarding: reading comprehension, reading comprehension regulation strategies and domain-specific prior knowledge. To evaluate the performance in learning, the quality of the proposals made in concept maps and summaries were taken adapting the procedure proposed by Haugwitz, Nesbit and Sandmann (2010), and also the results obtained by the students in a multiple-choice questionnaire about the knowledge area. Likewise, the level of collaboration perceived by each member of the teams was examined using a Collaboration questionnaire developed by Chan and Chan (2011). The identification and characterization of the processes of social regulation was carried out through a qualitative analysis of the exchanges registered during the collaborative activity, considering the type (co-regulation and shared regulation) and the regulation orientation (directed to the task or to the management of collaboration). The quantitative results analysis showed the existence of significant effects working with collaborative concept maps in the knowledge acquired during the collaborative task and in some of the indicators of perceived collaboration. Although no significant statistical differences were found, in the teams that elaborated expository summaries, a predominance of episodes of regulation directed towards the cognitive activity of the collaborative task was observed, being scarce, in both conditions, the episodes of social regulation directed towards collaboration within the triads. © 2018, Sciedu Press.

AB  - The aim of this research was to reveal the relationship between student's reading interest and critical thinking skills through Reading Concept Map Group Investigation (Remap GI) and Reading Concept Map Jigsaw (Remap Jigsaw) learning models. To do so, two science classes from first grade of two Senior High Schools in Malang, Indonesia were selected as the participants of the study. They were given the reading interest questionnaire and critical thinking skills essay test after thought by two different learning models. The obtained data were analyzed through Pearson Product Moment Coefficient of Correlation and doing a statistical regression analysis. The result revealed that there was no correlation between two variables both in Remap GI or Remap Jigsaw class. Because of no correlation between two variables was found, two variables were compared through Remap GI and Remap Jigsaw using descriptive analysis. The finding of this study has some implications for teachers to consider some aspect or skills from students and their relationship with each other. So the teacher can predict what needs to be developed and how to do it. © 2018, Eskisehir Osmangazi University.

AB  - Teaching Experimental Sciences is a compulsory subject in the Bachelor’s Degree in Primary Education (BDPE). It belongs to the discipline of Education and to the field of "Knowledge of the social and natural environment", and consists of a total of 24 ECTS, of which 6 ECTS correspond to "Teaching Natural Sciences" (TNS). This subject is taught in the second half of the second year of the BDPE. The aim of this work has been the presentation of this subject as a Knowledge Model (KM) including interlinked Concept Maps (CCMM) with different levels of deepness of the developed topics; and to check if this new way of presentation has a positive effect on students’ satisfaction towards the learning and teaching process (LTP) by inquiring about the meaningful learning and coherency of the contents by using CCMM. Results show although it is difficult to change from the comfort zone at the beginning, when students start using Cmap Tools for creating their own Knowledge Models, they finish learning meaningfully and understanding better the whole subject, find it easier to study for the evaluation and get to the domain of Knowledge by reaching basic, general and specific skills. © 2018 by authors, all rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents an ‘education for sustainability’ curricular model which promotes science learning in an elementary classroom through equity pedagogy. A total of 25 fourth-grade students from an urban, public school in Denver, Colorado participated in this mixed-methods study where concept maps were used as a tool for describing and assessing students’ understanding of ecosystem interactions. Concept maps provide a more holistic, systems-based assessment of science learning in a sustainability curriculum. The concept maps were scored and analyzed using SPSS to investigate potential differences in learning gains of English Language Acquisition (ELA) and Gifted/Talented (GT) students. Interviews were conducted after the concept maps were administered, then transcribed and inductively coded to generate themes related to science learning. Interviews also encouraged students to explain their drawings and provided a more accurate interpretation of the concept maps. Findings revealed the difference between pre-and post-concept map scores for ELA and GT learners were not statistically significant. Students also demonstrated an increased knowledge of ecosystem interactions during interviews. Concept maps, as part of an education for sustainability curriculum, can promote equity by providing diverse learners with different—yet equally valid—outlets to express their scientific knowledge. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This study is a qualitative-quantitative research, where the main concern is to investigate Content knowledge representation of Filipino Teachers in their schema (proposition, linear ordering and imagery) of some biology topics. The five biology topics includes: Photosynthesis, Cellular Respiration, human reproductive system, Mendelian genetics and NonMendelian genetics. The study focuses on the six (6) biology teachers and a total of 222 students in their respective classes. Of the Six (6) teachers, three (3) are under the Science curriculum and three (3) under regular curriculum in both public and private schools in Iligan city and Lanao del Norte, Philippines. The study utilizes interpretative case-study method, bracketing method, and concept analysis for qualitative part. For quantitative, it uses a nonparametric statistical tool, Kendall's Tau to determine congruence of students and teachers' concept maps and paired t-test for testing the significant differences of pre-and post-instruction concept maps to determine the effects of students' conceptual understanding before and after the teacher's representation of their schema that requires the teachers' thinking processes. The data were cross-validated with two or more techniques used in the study. The data collection entailed seven (7) months immersion: one (1) month for preliminary phase for the researcher to gain teachers' and students' confidence and the succeeding six (6) months for main observation and data collection. Results indicate that the teacher utilize six methods to construct meaning of concepts, three methods of representing classification, four methods to represent relationships, seven methods to represent transformation and three methods to represent causation in planning and implementing the lessons. They often modify definitions in the textbook and express these in lingua franca to be better understood by the students. Furthermore, the teachers' analogs given to student are sometimes far from the things, objects, events or processes being compared to. This suggests that teachers sometimes provide the condition for students' developing alternative conception through analogy/metaphors that they give. Also, the results suggest that there is significant differences between the pre and post instruction mean scores of concept maps before and after the teacher representation of their schema. Moreover, most of the topic (photosynthesis, human reproductive system, Mendelian and non-Mendelian genetics) studied have moderately or substantial to high agreement between the two groups. Hence, suggest that the teachers' representation highly influence student conceptual. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - This mixed research, is a snapshot of some Filipino Biology teachers' knowledge structure and how their concepts of the five topics in Biology (Photosynthesis, Cellular Respiration, human reproductive system, Mendelian genetics and NonMendelian genetics) functions and develops inside a biology classroom. The study focuses on the six biology teachers and a total of 222 students in their respective classes. Of the Six (6) teachers, three (3) are under the Science curriculum and the other three (3) are under regular curriculum in both public and private schools in Iligan city and Lanao del Norte, Philippines. The study utilized classroom discourses, concept maps, interpretative case-study method, bracketing method, and concept analysis for qualitative part; the quantitative part uses a nonparametric statistical tool, Kendall's tau Coefficient for determining relationship and congruency while measures of central tendencies and dispersion (mean, and standard deviation) for concept maps scores interpretation. Knowledge Base of Biology teachers were evaluated by experts in field of specialization having a doctorate program (e.g. PhD in Genetics) and PhD Biology candidates. The data collection entailed seven (7) months immersion: one (1) month for preliminary phase for the researcher to gain teachers' and students' confidence and the succeeding six (6) months for main observation and data collection. The evaluation of teachers' knowledge base by experts indicated that teachers' knowledge of (65%) is lower than the minimum (75%) recommended by ABD-el-Khalick and Boujaoude (1997). Thus, the experts believe that content knowledge of the teachers is hardly adequate for their teaching assignment. Moreover, the teachers in this study do not systematically use reallife situation to apply the concepts they teach. They can identify concepts too abstract for their student; however, they seldom use innovative ways to bring the discussion to their students' level of readiness and capacity to learn. Kendall's Tau Coefficient of agreement indicated that there is an agreement of the rating by experts and PhD (Biology) candidates. As for recommended level for teaching based on the respondent content knowledge structure, the experts and the PhD (Biology) candidates agree that the content knowledge of the teachers is at the borderline (rating of 6) between elementary and high school. These results imply that biology teachers need in-service training to upgrade their content knowledge in the subject. At the same time, the pre-service curriculum for biology teachers needs upgrading. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - The first step to starting research is to familiarize with the research field, which is a difficult task for non-experts. They usually do not know which exact information to gather or which strategy to follow. There exists some literature on supporting them by means of guidelines, visualizations and critical thinking. However, they must be supported such that they can form their own strategies to objectively evaluate the research field. Therefore, a tool was developed to help non-experts identify which information to gather, structure the gathered information by means of a visualization and perform the task in a time-efficient manner. Finally, a user study was conducted to investigate the validity of the proposed approach. Results show that the developed software tool supports non-experts in their literature review process by providing them with an overview of the research field and making the process time-efficient. © 2018 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

AB  - Energy is an interdisciplinary concept which is directly or indirectly related to many concepts in sciences. As a result of not employing an interdisciplinary teaching in teaching the energy topic, the researches done in both our country and other countries show that students’ perceptions related to energy is far from being scientific. The purpose of this research is to determine to what extent grade- 8 students associate the situations related to energy that they often encounter in daily life to energy. For this purpose, data were collected from 435 grade-8 students using the CoMPAT technique, which is a concept mapping technique that is carried out with photographs. The results of the research show that students cannot establish a connection between energy and living things and chemical substances. They know the physical dimension of energy better than chemical and biological dimensions of energy. This indicates that an integration among disciplines cannot be provided in teaching energy topic. © 2018. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to develop problem-based learning and concept mapping by using a block-based programming model (PBL-CBp model) and to evaluate the appropriateness of the PBL-CBp model. The research will be divided into two parts. The first part will be about learning style development and will study the theories and ideas which relate to problem-based learning, the programming process and the concept mapping and block-based programming. It will synthesise the steps in the problem-based learning method, and the steps in the program process and design the learning steps by using problem-based concept mapping and block-based programming. The second part will consist of an evaluation of the appropriateness of the model. An appropriateness questionnaire for the PBL-CBp model will be created and the PBL-CBp model, the experts found that the overall view was that it was 'very good' (X = 4.71,S.D. = 0.49),that the input part was also 'very good' (X = 4.58,S.D. = 0.55), as was the learning process (X = 4.85,S.D. = 0.40), the evaluation was 'good' (X = 4.30,S.D. = 0.48), and the feedback was 'very good' (X = 4.80,S.D. = 0.42), the results show that this PBL-CBp model could be used to enhance the programming competency of undergraduate students in computer science. © 2018 Satien Janpla, Pallop Piriyasurawong; published by UIKTEN.

AB  - Integrating disciplinary thinking has become a critical component of higher education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Within STEM disciplines, students are introduced to a wide range of multidisciplinary projects, courses, and programmes. Multidisciplinary projects require students to collaborate with other students, educators and professionals from diverse academic and professional backgrounds. Working in teams can be challenging for students especially when they are seldom taught how to collaborate with other disciplines. The goal of the study is to understand students’ opinions on multidisciplinary collaboration. Students from engineering and design were asked to develop concept maps that illustrate aspects of successful multidisciplinary teamwork. Concept maps were scored by counting concepts, hierarchical levels and cross-links. Content analysis was conducted to qualitatively understand the key concepts and nature of relationship between the concepts. Characteristics of multidisciplinary teamwork were compared across disciplines. Communication, teamwork, conflict resolution, celebrating diversity and finding a common goal were identified as key determinants of successful multidisciplinary teams. The outcomes of the study have several implications for educators and institutions planning to develop or improve multidisciplinary projects, courses or programmes. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

AB  - The Environmental Education, believing on the break-up the unsustainable ways of being and doing in the world, on valuing natural diversity and community, on democratizing knowledge and making decisions for and with the collective, requires pedagogical practice that allow the action of the subjects involved, with space for their previous understandings, proposition of actions and systemic understanding. In this work we make theoretical considerations about the Methodology of Trees and the concept maps as paths that integrate and articulate the pedagogical doing in Environmental Education. The Methodology of Trees contributes to understanding the environment, identifying conflicts and planning related actions with sustainability. Concept maps favor the understanding of complex issues, the identification of concepts and contents, as well as their interrelationships through a systemic approach. The combination of these ways contributes so that the pedagogical practice in Environmental Education is based on collective dialogue and knowledge, contextualized, interdisciplinary and meaningful. © 2018, Foundation Journal of Science Education.

AB  - Background: The Ebola virus epidemic and civil war in Liberia left the country in need of strengthening the health workforce. E-learning in medical education provides relevant learning opportunities for students, develops faculty competencies, and assists with the retention of healthcare workers. The Stellenbosch University Rural Medical Education Partnership Initiative (SURMEPI), the College of Health and Life Sciences (COHLS) at the University of Liberia (UL), and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) formed a partnership to create an e-learning solution for the COHLS. Objective: This article outlines the implementation of an e-learning solution for the COHLS in Monrovia, and describes the challenges met, the key successes achieved, and the lessons learnt. Methods: An initial scoping visit to Liberia was followed by three further on-site visits. Problems identified were: very limited or no network and computer resources, no internet connection, intermittent power, and lack of IT skills. We followed an evolutionary approach to infrastructure implementation by trying various solutions before settling on an offsite-hosted solution using Software as a Service (SaaS). Local staff were upskilled to administer this while remote support from Stellenbosch IT was provided. A stable internet connection was established. Staff and students can access the Learning Management System (LMS) 24/7 using mobile devices and laptops. Workshops were held where staff were taught how to produce online teaching material. Each class has at least one teaching assistant to assist lecturers with uploading and indexing material on the LMS. A benchmarking visit by COHLS faculty to Stellenbosch University took place, during which an e-learning strategic plan was drawn up. Further online workshops were conducted, and teaching materials were placed on the new LMS. Outcomes: The intranet that was established consisted of internet connection and software as a service in the form of Office 365, providing access to several products and services. The e-learning model attended to technology and human resources simultaneously. The e-learning strategy aimed to improve teaching and learning at the COHLS, boost the number of qualified doctors, reduce the workload on lecturers, and be scalable in the future. Conclusion: It is challenging to implement e-learning in medical education. Inadequate infrastructure, limited bandwidth, lack of skilled IT staff, unreliable power supply, time commitment, and ongoing maintenance all need to be overcome. The creation of an e-learning solution for the COHLS over a period of 15 months was enabled by the common vision and close collaboration of the three partners. This model can potentially be replicated across other faculties in the University of Liberia and other educational institutions in Liberia. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - We present a system that utilizes a wide variety of available assessment information to automatically analyze students' understanding at a conceptual level and offer relevant automated support to teachers and students. This support includes interactive visualization of the conceptual knowledge assessment, individualized suggestions for resources to improve areas of weakness, and suggestions for dynamic student groups for inclass activities. This system differs from prior related work in that the basis for analysis and feedback is entirely customized to the individual instructors' course content. We discuss how the system is configured for each course, and provide evidence that this configuration process helps instructors improve their course content. We then provide detailed descriptions of how the system performs analysis and offers support including suggesting resources for students and creating dynamic groups within a class. Finally, we discuss the potential benefits provided by this system and how the system is being applied to six different computer science courses currently.

AB  - The pupils' poor performance in science in South African secondary schools is well documented. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to conduct a study that would portray knowledge structures for teaching a science topic. This is an empirical qualitative interpretive multiple case study looking at four physical science teachers teaching Doppler Effect to Grade 12 pupils. The data was collected through classroom observations and teacher interviews. Data analysis was done using concept maps. The results show that teachers' knowledge as portrayed during the teaching lack coherence and to some extent the correctness that is expected of teachers. The weaknesses are considered likely to compromise their pupils' conceptual understanding of the topic. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - How, when and what kind of learning takes place are key questions in all educational environments. School graduates are expected to have reached a development level whereby they have, among many fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, to plan their studies and their future, and to integrate knowledge across disciplines. However, it is challenging to develop these skills in schools. Following existing curricula, disciplines are often taught separately and by different teachers, making it difficult for students to connect knowledge studied and learned from one discipline to that of another discipline. The Next Generation Science Standards on teaching and learning natural science in the United States point out important crosscutting concepts in science education (NGSS, 2013). In Estonia, similar trends are leading to an emphasis on the need to further develop scientific literacy skills and interdisciplinary learning in students. The changing environment around us must be reflected in changes in our school system. In this paper, we report on research that intends to answer the questions: (a) "How much do Estonian students develop an interdisciplinary understanding of science throughout their high school education?", and (b) "Is their thinking more interdisciplinary after two years of studies in an Estonian high school?" Additionally, we analyzed the results based on the type of school the students attended, and we examined the use concept mapping to assess interdisciplinary learning. This research is part of an overall study that involved students from 44 Estonian high schools taking a science test similar to the three-dimensional Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test (hereafter called PISA-like multidimensional test) as well as constructing concept maps, while in 10th and 12th grade. In this paper, we report on the analysis of the results for 182 of the students, concentrating on the analysis of the concept maps they constructed. The results suggest that there were changes in the students' interdisciplinary knowledge, but these were small and varied depending on the students' school type. They also suggest that changes may be needed in the Estonian educational system to increase the students' level of interdisciplinary understanding of science. © 2018 Hong Kong Bao Long Accounting And Secretarial Limited.

AB  - Purpose To conduct a scoping review to explore the construct of shared mental models (SMMs) in the context of clinical teamwork among health professions learners. Method The authors searched the PubMed, ERIC, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, PsychINFO, and EMBASE databases for English-language articles published between 2000 and 2016. Eligible articles mentioned SMMs in relation to clinical teamwork and included health professions learners. Two reviewers screened studies for eligibility and extracted data to determine the depth and breadth of the literature on SMMs. The authors examined definitions of the SMM construct in the context of clinical teams, educational interventions using SMMs, and the measurement of SMMs. Results Of the 1,273 articles retrieved, 23 met the inclusion criteria. SMMs were defined in less than two-fifths of the articles (9/23). All articles applied the construct to improvements in hospitalbased patient safety, often in highintensity settings (14/23). Most articles included graduate-level physicians (21/23) within clinical teams (18/23). Interventions designed to foster SMMs (6/23) included teamwork curricula/ training and teamwork supportive tools. Measurements of SMMs (7/23) included a qualitative task analysis, quantitative analyses of speech, a concept mapping, and Likert-type surveys. Conclusions In health professions education, the SMM construct lacks clear definition. Few studies described educational interventions aimed at SMM development, and few attempted to measure the construct. The authors propose an operational definition of SMMs in health care and illustrate how interventions intended to foster SMMs, such as team trainings or planning exercises and communication tools, could be developed, implemented, and assessed. © 2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the contents of physics education shown in the questions on the middle-school physics teacher employment examination. The analysis was performed on the questions given in the physics section of the middle school physics teacher employment examination during the 2002~2017 school years. For the analysis, the contents of physics education were divided into the history of science and the philosophy of science, physics inquiries, physics curricula, physics learning theories, physical learning models, physical teaching-learning strategies, and physics learning evaluations. In the domains of the history of science and the philosophy of science, modern theories on the philosophy of science were frequently given whereas questions about the traditional philosophies of science were relatively fewer. In the domain of learning theories, many questions related to changes in misconceptions were given. In the domain of teaching-learning strategies, comparison, concept maps, and V-diagrams were most frequently dealt with. In the domain of evaluations, questions about the creation of checklists associated with curriculum evaluations were repeatedly used.

AB  - Underpinned by a holistic, dynamic, and process-oriented view of teacher competences, this study provides an analytic hierarchy system of instructional design competence (IDC) for evaluating teachers' IDC based on the mental model of instructional design. Additionally, this study quantitatively explores the IDC characteristics and correlations of 118 preservice science teachers at Shanxi Normal University in China, who learned the ADTRE (analyzing, designing, teaching, revising, and evaluating/improving) instructional model, based on reflection and feedback. Using lesson planning (LP) scoring rubrics, we analyzed 113 lesson plans from 56 participants majoring in biological science and 57 in biological technology. We present the ADTRE model and discuss relationships between preservice science teachers' academic achievement and IDC. Major findings include a positive correlation between preservice science teachers' IDC scores and their course grades in Advanced Mathematics and Cell Biology and concept mapping skills. There was a negative correlation between preservice science teachers' IDC and course grades in Principles of Genetic Engineering and Technology, and no significant correlations existed between IDC and course grades for teacher education courses. Our findings reveal the nature of preservice science teachers' IDC, a potential for improvement in university teacher education curricula, and a need for further research. © Authors.

AB  - Teachers need an understanding of the nature of science (NOS) to enable them to incorporate NOS into their teaching of science. The current study examines the usefulness of a strategy for challenging or changing teachers’ understandings of NOS. The teachers who participated in this study were 10 initial teacher education chemistry students and six experienced teachers from secondary and primary schools who were introduced to an explicit and reflective activity, a dramatic reading about a historical scientific development. Concept maps were used before and after the activity to assess teachers’ knowledge of NOS. The participants also took part in a focus group interview to establish whether they perceived the activity as useful in developing their own understanding of NOS. Initial analysis led us to ask another group, comprising seven initial teacher education chemistry students, to take part in a modified study. These participants not only completed the same tasks as the previous participants but also completed a written reflection commenting on whether the activity and focus group discussion enhanced their understanding of NOS. Both Lederman et al.’s (Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 39(6), 497–521, 2002) concepts of NOS and notions of “naive” and “informed” understandings of NOS and Hay’s (Studies in Higher Education, 32(1), 39–57, 2007) notions of “surface” and “deep” learning were used as frameworks to examine the participants’ specific understandings of NOS and the depth of their learning. The ways in which participants’ understandings of NOS were broadened or changed by taking part in the dramatic reading are presented. The impact of the data-gathering tools on the participants’ professional learning is also discussed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Advance organizer strategies based on cognitive theories have been found to have an impact on learning in the early studies. However, recent studies have found inconclusive results when type and format of the advance organizers were taken into account. This study investigated the impact of different formats of advance organizers (graphic with text explanation, voice narration, and concept map) on learners understanding of science concepts. A total of 136 high school students participated in this study. A factorial design was utilized for the experiment using format of advance organizers as the independent variable while learners achievement on retention and transfer test regarding the learning content as the dependent variables. The findings showed that using graphical advance organizers, especially the concept map, worked effectively in achieving high school students understanding of the learning content. The results showed that using concept map was likely to conceptually anchored viewers attention on key elements of reading content. When designing instructional materials, it is advised to take the advantage of graphical organizers to achieve understanding of abstract science concepts. Implications and suggestions for effective instructional design and for future studies are provided in this paper. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years collaborative concept mapping (CCM) has become a very useful didactic teaching tool for teaching and learning about different topics. It engages the student in active learning and helps him to organize his ideas. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of using CCM on university students’ learning achievement in two subjects: ethical principles and deontology in university (EPDU) and Physics. 64 students from faculty of sciences participated in this research. All students in our sample took courses in EPDU and physics, at formal situation. Students were randomly divided into two groups; experimental and control groups. The students in the experimental groups constructed CCM at the end of each lesson. Meanwhile, the control groups were taught by just traditional teaching strategies. All groups took multiple choice learning achievement tests. No significant difference was found between groups which took courses on EPDU. While, a significant difference in favour of the experimental group, where CCM after conventional teaching methods was applied to learn physics, has been observed. The results support that when students are constructed CCM in a scientific subject like physics, they achieve the best scores. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.

AB  - Scaffolds in games have the potential to facilitate learning effects in addition to assisting the gaming process. However, studies on game-based science learning usually only adopt questionnaires to evaluate scientific concepts, and use interviews or observations to assess problem solving ability, neglecting the importance of investigating game-making outcomes. We customized a digital game, “Crayon Physics Deluxe,” with varied scaffolding designs to evaluate their effects on science learning. A total of 126 participants were divided into four groups: demonstration scaffolding, non-scaffolding, marking critical features scaffolding, and the no-game group. Learning outcomes were examined in terms of physics knowledge acquisition (in the form of concept maps) and design creativity (in the form of game episode designs). Students were asked to transform their roles from problem solvers to problem designers, which might not only demonstrate their ability to solve scientific problems, but also develop their creativity potential in designing scientific puzzles. The results indicated that the marking critical features scaffolding group performed significantly better than the demonstration scaffolding group in both conceptual knowledge acquisition and the sensitivity dimension of design creativity, while the group with demonstration scaffolding scored higher in the flexibility dimension of design creativity. These findings suggest that proper scaffolds could be designed to function as learning scaffolds rather than just as gaming scaffolds, and different learning purposes require various scaffolding designs. The content of the scaffolds, as well as the timing of their provision should be carefully designed according to the game features to achieve specific instructional purposes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Institutions have developed diverse approaches that vary in effectiveness and cost to improve student performance in introductory science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses. We developed a low-cost, graduate student-led, metacognition-based study skills course taught in conjunction with the introductory biology series at Miami University. Our approach aimed to improve performance for underachieving students by combining an existing framework for the process of learning (the study cycle) with concrete tools (outlines and concept maps) that have been shown to encourage deep understanding. To assess the effectiveness of our efforts, we asked 1) how effective our voluntary recruitment model was at enrolling the target cohort, 2) how the course impacted performance on lecture exams, 3) how the course impacted study habits and techniques, and 4) whether there are particular study habits or techniques that are associated with large improvements on exam scores. Voluntary recruitment attracted only 11-17% of our target cohort. While focal students improved on lecture exams relative to their peers who did not enroll, gains were relatively modest, and not all students improved. Further, although students across both semesters of our study reported improved study habits (based on pre and post surveys) and on outlines and concept maps (based on retrospectively scored assignments), gains were more dramatic in the Fall semester. Multivariate models revealed that, while changes in study habits and in the quality of outlines and concept maps were weakly associated with change in performance on lecture exams, relationships were only significant in the Fall semester and were sometimes counterintuitive. Although benefits of the course were offset somewhat by the inefficiency of voluntary recruitment, we demonstrate the effectiveness our course, which is inexpensive to implement and has advantage of providing pedagogical experience to future educators. © 2017 T.

AB  - This study focuses on how teachers learn to teach a new topic and the role played by their developing content knowledge as they teach. The paper is based on seven high school science teachers’ studies on the teaching of semiconductors, at the time a new topic in the curriculum. Analysis of artefacts such as teacher concept maps, video recordings of lessons, journals and other classroom-based evidence shows how the extent and type of teachers’ content knowledge informed their choice of teaching approaches and how their learning of content took place alongside the development of teaching strategies. The development of content knowledge was combined with increased understanding of how to teach the topic in almost all cases. Evidence of development of teachers’ PCK was found in their increased ability to design teaching strategies, and their use of representations and suitable assessment tasks for their lessons. Some specific common teaching strategies were identified across the teachers. These strategies could add to the canon of teachers’ topic - specific professional knowledge for semiconductors. The study provides increased understanding of how teachers simultaneously master content and its teaching and how mediated self-reflection is a fruitful approach for assisting teachers to learn to teach a new topic. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Phenomenon: The integration of public health (PH) competency training into medical education, and further integration of PH and primary care, has been urged by the U.S. Institute of Medicine. However, PH competencies are numerous, and no consensus exists over which competencies are most important for adoption by current trainees. Our objective was to conduct a group concept mapping exercise with stakeholders identifying the most important and feasible PH skills to incorporate in medical and residency curricula. Approach: We utilized a group concept mapping technique via the Concept System Global Max (http://www.conceptsystems.com), where family medicine educators and PH professionals completed the phrase, “A key Public Health competency for physicians-in-training to learn is …” with 1–10 statements. The statement list was edited for duplication and other issues; stakeholders then sorted the statements and rated them for importance and feasibility of integration. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were used to create a two-dimensional point map of domains of PH training, allowing visual comparison of groupings of related ideas and relative importance of these ideas. Findings: There were 116 nonduplicative statements (225 total) suggested by 120 participants. Three metacategories of competencies emerged: Clinic, Community & Culture, Health System Understanding, and Population Health Science & Data. Insights: We identified and organized a set of topics that serve as a foundation for the integration of family medicine and PH education. Incorporating these topics into medical education is viewed as important and feasible by family medicine educators and PH professions. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Online learning has been applied in various educational institutions, and have some positive effects on the conventional learning, especially if both learning is collaborated. Online learning helps teaching difficulties in conventional learning where learning process of individual student is hard to know in detailed by the teacher because of too many students in a single class. With online learning assisted by Learning Management System (LMS) teachers can know each student individual learning process by analyzing student log activity on the LMS which is often called by behavioral tracking. LMS used as research material is Moodle that has been applied to the Computer Science Education Department, UPI. The purpose of this research is to find learning status of each student by analyzing student's behavior while using the Moodle LMS. One of behavioral tracking model which can be used to determine the student's learning status is Monitoring Online Course with Log Data (MOCLog) model. By combining the concept map, and solution map, this model can analyze log data on Moodle LMS, and generate learning status of each individual student. Then the teacher can determine what behavioral traits are dominant, and most influential on learning with association rule data mining technique with apriori algorithms. This study provides that dominant learning status on the Computer Network course with 84.75 % students is Normal Learning Status while Frequent Access the Course to be an activity that greatly affect the student's learning status in the Moodle LMS course with 48 students. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - We recently transformed a traditional introductory biology course into an active learning experience that resonates with a wide range of undergraduate students. Backward course design led to an innovative curriculum that (1) is based on biology's big ideas, (2) has measurable learning outcomes, and (3) encourages development of higher order thinking skills. Our studio classroom design maximizes interactions; cantilevered workstations distributed throughout the room encourage student-instructor and student-student interactions. Group discussions occur at whiteboards as students solve problems, create concept maps, plan experiments and interpret experimental data. Workstation computers and dual monitors support whole-class instruction as well as student-led group explorations. The classroom design meets the traditional needs of a biology lab, including access to sinks, use of compound microscopes, data acquisition, gel electrophoresis and thermal cyclers. This creative new learning space supports a constructivist approach to learning, moving student conversations past rote repetition of textbook material to evaluation and synthesis of ideas, as well as dialogue about how science generates new information and the interface between biology and engineering. In the interest of helping others along their path toward implementing active learning in their classrooms, we share a description of our course transformation and important lessons learned in the process. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.

AB  - Formative assessment is a new method of educational assessment. In contrast to summative assessment, formative assessment constitutes a relatively modern assessment method, whose goal is to reveal the student's weaknesses to the teacher and help the teacher to design accordingly appropriate practices to aid the students improve their performance. Formative assessment application can be done periodically and can be categorized to short-term, when executed between classes, and to long-term. Several innovative assessment techniques for assessment in engineering education have been proposed during the recent years, such as the use of concept maps, assessing student's Learning Outcomes, five step outcome driven assessment and more, both quantitative and qualitative assessment methods. A smart system especially designed and implemented for the particular needs of engineering education and STEM education in general, is presented on this paper. Such a system is currently under development and tested for the purposes of mathematical education in primary and secondary education. If the right adjustments and modifications are made, it can work for STEM education as well. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The need for assessing higher level thinking skills and using appropriate evaluation methods in programs for the gifted is necessary to better evaluate the effectiveness of these programs. The purpose of this study was to test the claim of Novak and Gowin (1984) that concept maps required higher level thinking skills. A related purpose of the study was to assess which type of measure, a multiple choice test or concept maps, could yield a more accurate or detailed picture of the gains in content understanding of students performing at the highest level on the instruments. A mixed method research design was used to answer the research questions. We concluded that concept maps and multiple choice tests did not measure or require the same thinking skills because of non-significant correlations between the two instruments. Three judges' qualitative analysis also indicated that the number of items requiring higher level thinking skills on multiple choice tests was limited. Concept mapping as a whole process and the crosslinks component of concept mapping required analysis or higher level thinking skills. Also we concluded that concept mapping as a whole process has the potential to show greater gains in scores of the students than the multiple choice items, and crosslinks component of concept mapping that required analysis or higher level thinking skills. To have an alignment between the curricula of programs for gifted students and assessment methods used in these programs, the search for assessment methods requiring higher thinking skills is necessary and needs more investigation. © 2015 Journal for the Education of Gifted Young Scientists.

AB  - This study aimed to discover subject-specific science teachers' views of alternative assessment. The questionnaire by Okur (2008) was adapted and deployed for data collection. The sample consisted of 80 subject-specific science teachers drawn from the cities of Trabzon, Rize and Erzurum in Turkey. In analyzing data, descriptive analysis was employed for identifying how often the subject-specific science teachers use the alternative assessment and which of the alternative assessment techniques are frequently preferred. Also, how gender variable affects their preference and/or self-competency was analyzed via independent samples t-test. In light of the results, it can be deduced that the subject-specific science teachers tended to use such traditional assessment techniques as multiple choice test, concept map, written test, and matching test. Further, the main barrier to involve the alternative assessment in science classes seems to be the high-staking nation-wide exams in Turkey that deploy only multiple-choice questions. Therefore, any change in assessment strategy of the high-staking nation-wide exams may foster teachers to enrich their preferences of alternative assessment and empower its possible use in science classes. © 2017 EdUHK APFSLT.

AB  - Concept maps of chemistry can be obtained from thesaurus of chemistry. Analysis of information in the field of chemistry is done at graduate level, based on comparing and analyzing chemistry dissertations by using these maps. Therefore, the use of thesaurus for analyzing scientific information is recommended. Major advantage of using this method, is that it is possible to obtain a detailed map of all academic researches across all branches of science. The researches analysis results in chemical science can play a key role in developing strategic research policies, educational programming, linking universities to industries and postgraduate educational programming. This paper will first introduce the concept maps of chemistry. Then, emerging patterns from the concept maps of chemistry will be used to analyze the trend in the academic dissertations in chemistry, using the data collected and stored in our database at Iranian Research Institute for Information Science and Technology (IranDoc) over the past 10 years (1998-2009).

AB  - The aim of this article is to propose a method for development of concept map in web-based environment for identifying concepts a student is deficient in after learning using traditional methods. Direct Hashing and Pruning algorithm was used to construct concept map. Redundancies within the concept map were removed to generate a learning sequence. Prototype learning system was developed based on this learning sequence using Android Emulator. For analysis purpose, 42 learners were given to learn the course Java Programming taught at graduation level. A posttest was conducted after learning for evaluation purpose. Multiple regression analysis method was applied on these results to develop regression equations for the proposed method of learning. Statistical Package for Social Sciences software was used for statistical analysis purposes. It was found that posttest results are directly proportional to the quality of traditional learning. Better quality students require less time in constructing prototype system. Further concept mapping was found to have a positive impact on proposed method of learning. When the number of concepts is large, a learning sequence among these can be generated using the proposed method. This learning sequence can be used to identify the concept a student needs additional learning. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - We systematically searched five databases to assess the potential of concept mapping-based technologies to promote self-regulated learning in science education. Our search uncovered 17 relevant studies that investigated seven different types of learning technologies. We performed a narrative analysis assessing how each technology affects self-regulated learning through cognitive, metacognitive, and motivation strategies, according to Schraw et al. (2006)'s model. We suggest concept mapping technologies may affect self-regulated learning through enhancing these strategies to varying degrees. Computer software was particularly useful for developing cognitive strategies through ease of use. Teaching agents were particularly useful for developing metacognitive strategies by coupling visualisation of knowledge patterns with performance monitoring, aided by a teaching metaphor. Finally, mobile devices and teaching agents were most effective in enhancing motivation. Effects on knowledge gains remain unclear due to small sample sizes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Helping scientists and engineers challenge received assumptions about how science, engineering, and society relate is a critical cornerstone for macroethics education. Scientific and engineering research are frequently framed as first steps of a value-free linear model that inexorably leads to societal benefit. Social studies of science and assessments of scientific and engineering research speak to the need for a more critical approach to the noble intentions underlying these assumptions. “Science Outside the Lab” is a program designed to help early-career scientists and engineers understand the complexities of science and engineering policy. Assessment of the program entailed a pre-, post-, and 1 year follow up survey to gauge student perspectives on relationships between science and society, as well as a pre–post concept map exercise to elicit student conceptualizations of science policy. Students leave Science Outside the Lab with greater humility about the role of scientific expertise in science and engineering policy; greater skepticism toward linear notions of scientific advances benefiting society; a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the actors involved in shaping science policy; and a continued appreciation of the contributions of science and engineering to society. The study presents an efficacious program that helps scientists and engineers make inroads into macroethical debates, reframe the ways in which they think about values of science and engineering in society, and more thoughtfully engage with critical mediators of science and society relationships: policy makers and policy processes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Science teachers need to help students identify their prior ideas and modify them based on scientific knowledge. This process is called as conceptual change. One of essential tools to analyze students' conceptual change is by using concept map. Concept Maps are graphical representations of knowledge that are comprised of concepts and the relationships between them. Constructing concept map is implemented by adapting the role of technology to support learning process, as it is suitable with Educational Ministry Regulation No.68 year 2013. Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) has developed CmapTools, a client-server software for easily construct and visualize concept maps. This research aims to investigate secondary students' conceptual change after experiencing five-stage conceptual teaching model by utilizing CmapTools in learning Optics. Weak experimental method through one group pretest-posttest design is implemented in this study to collect preliminary and post concept map as qualitative data. Sample was taken purposively of 8th grade students (n= 22) at one of private schools Bandung, West Java. Conceptual change based on comparison of preliminary and post concept map construction is assessed based on rubric of concept map scoring and structure. Results shows significance conceptual change differences at 50.92 % that is elaborated into concept map element such as prepositions and hierarchical level in high category, cross links in medium category and specific examples in low category. All of the results are supported with the students' positive response towards CmapTools utilization that indicates improvement of motivation, interest, and behavior aspect towards Physics lesson. © 2017 Author(s).

AB  - The authors find justification for integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in the complex problems that today's students will face as tomorrow's STEM professionals. Teachers with individual subject-area specialties in the STEM content areas have limited experience in integrating STEM. In this study, the authors investigated the conceptual changes of secondary school teachers teaching domain-specific STEM courses after a week-long professional development experience integrating earthquake engineering and domain-specific concepts. They documented and then triangulated outcomes of the experience using participating teachers' concept maps and teacher-generated written materials, respectively. Statistical comparisons of participants' concept maps revealed significant increases in their overall understanding of earthquake engineering and more accurate linkages with and among science domain-specific concepts. Content analyses of teachers' learning products confirmed the concept map analysis and also provided evidence of transfer of workshop learning experiences into teacher-designed curriculum products accurately linking earthquake engineering and domain-specific STEM content knowledge. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objectives As an essential skill in daily clinical nursing practice, critical thinking ability has been an important objective in nursing education. Concept mapping enables nursing students connect new information to existing knowledge and integrates interdisciplinary knowledge. However, there is a lack of evidence related to critical thinking ability and concept mapping in nursing education. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effect of concept mapping in developing critical thinking in nursing education. Design This systematic review was reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Data sources A search was conducted in PubMed, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing concept mapping and traditional teaching method were retrieved. Review methods Data were collected by two reviewers according to the data extraction tables. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed by other two reviewers. The results of meta-analysis were presented using mean difference (MD). Result Thirteen trials were summarized in the systematic review and eleven trials were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled effect size showed that, comparing with traditional methods, concept mapping could improve subjects’ critical thinking ability measured by California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI), California Critical Thinking Skill Test (CCTST) and Critical Thinking Scale (CTS). The subgroup analyses showed that concept mapping improved the score of all subscales. Conclusion The result of this review indicated that concept mapping could affect the critical thinking affective dispositions and critical thinking cognitive skills. Further high quality research using uniform evaluation is required. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, we investigated the value of a concept map marking guide as an alternative formative assessment tool for science teachers to adopt for the topic of energy. Eight high school science teachers marked students’ concept maps using an itemized holistic marking guide. Their marking was compared with the researchers’ marking and the scores of a multiple-choice diagnostic test. Statistical analysis revealed that teachers evaluated students’ concept maps consistently, but the concept map scores were only mildly correlated with the multiple-choice test scores. We explored what each assessment method revealed in terms of students’ understanding with one student’s performance as a showcase. Teachers’ views on using the marking guide of concept maps as an assessment tool were also included. We discuss the value of the concept map marking guide as a formative assessment tool for science teachers to create and modify in order to encourage students’ conceptual learning. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Introduction: Cervical adenocarcinoma represents a critical health problem in many underserved regions of the world and parts of the U.S. This module provides learning opportunities in the areas of female anatomy, physiology, histology, and pathology. This includes diagnosis by ultrasound and CT/PET scan, detailed staging and treatment of the cancer by various criteria, and future prevention by vaccination and screening. Methods: Authors include a fourth-year medical student and a seasoned PBL facilitator with a basic science interest in cancer. In this problem-based learning module (PBL), a group of first-year medical students review the material that is released online for each of three weekly 90-minute sessions. Key learning issues are identified, researched out-of-class, and discussed at the beginning of the subsequent session. A differential diagnosis is weighed and the module culminates with a concept map drawn by students to integrate all relevant aspects and mechanisms of the case. Results: The module was implemented twice with a small group of seven students. Students learned to correlate relevant biochemical mechanisms, histological, and anatomical features with the clinical signs and symptoms, to diagnose and suggest treatment options. The module was well-liked, and revised for publication by rebalancing the material based on specific student feedback. Discussion: The PBL small-group format provides a unique opportunity over both semesters for first-year medical students to study clinical cases in a student-directed fashion and develop professional skills at various levels. Potential pitfalls lie in the online format, as this requires clear rules on computer usage and data sharing.

AB  - Disciplinary boundaries become increasingly unclear when grappling with “wicked problems,” which present a complex set of policy, cultural, technological, and scientific dimensions. “T-shaped” professionals, i.e. individuals with a depth and breadth of expertise, are being called upon to play a critical role in complex problem-solving. This paper unpacks the notion of the “T-shaped expert” and seeks to situate it within the broader academic literature on expertise, integration, and developmental learning. A component of this project includes an exploratory study, which is aimed at evaluating the emergent attributes of T-shaped expertise in two different educational programs completed between January and May in 2015. The two programs build disciplinary knowledge in science, technology engineering, and mathematics fields at the core (vertical dimension), while expanding the students’ awareness and comprehension of other expertise (horizontal dimension). The courses introduced science and engineering students to case study topics focusing around complex human-technological-ecological systems in a nanotechnology and society course; and the governance of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in a science, technology, and society course. We analyze pre- and post-test data from this pilot project before presenting findings that pertain to student learning, as well as variants in the methodology and reflect on the utility (and limitations) of the selected methodology for evaluating expertise as it evolves over time. The paper closes with a discussion of a theory of acquisition with implications for delineating early attributes and characteristics of T-shaped expertise. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Introduction Dissemination and implementation research training has great potential to improve the impact and reach of health-related research; however, research training needs from the end user perspective are unknown. This paper identifies and prioritizes dissemination and implementation research training needs. Methods A diverse sample of researchers, practitioners, and policymakers was invited to participate in Concept Mapping in 2014–2015. Phase 1 (Brainstorming) gathered participants’ responses to the prompt: To improve the impact of research evidence in practice and policy settings, a skill in which researchers need more training is… The resulting statement list was edited and included subsequent phases. Phase 2 (Sorting) asked participants to sort each statement into conceptual piles. In Phase 3 (Rating), participants rated the difficulty and importance of incorporating each statement into a training curriculum. A multidisciplinary team synthesized and interpreted the results in 2015–2016. Results During Brainstorming, 60 researchers and 60 practitioners/policymakers contributed 274 unique statements. Twenty-nine researchers and 16 practitioners completed sorting and rating. Nine concept clusters were identified: Communicating Research Findings, Improve Practice Partnerships, Make Research More Relevant, Strengthen Communication Skills, Develop Research Methods and Measures, Consider and Enhance Fit, Build Capacity for Research, and Understand Multilevel Context. Though researchers and practitioners had high agreement about importance (r =0.93) and difficulty (r =0.80), ratings differed for several clusters (e.g., Build Capacity for Research). Conclusions Including researcher and practitioner perspectives in competency development for dissemination and implementation research identifies skills and capacities needed to conduct and communicate contextualized, meaningful, and relevant research. © 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine

AB  - This study used a between-subjects experimental design to examine the effects of three different computer-based instructional strategies (concept map, refutation text, and expository scientific text) on science learning. Concept maps are node-link diagrams that show concepts as nodes and relationships among the concepts as labeled links. Refutational texts are designed specifically to elicit common misconceptions that learners typically hold about a particular topic, directly refute the misconceptions, and present scientific explanations as compelling alternatives. Expository scientific texts consist of texts that are written specifically to present correct scientific information. Sixty-seven participants were randomly assigned to study one of three computer-based presentations on climate change. The dependent measures were tests of free recall and transfer. The concept map group significantly outperformed the refutational and scientific text groups on both free recall and transfer tests. Practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Climate change is one of the most challenging problems facing today’s global society (e.g., IPCC 2013). While climate change is a widely covered topic in the media, and abundant information is made available through the internet, the causes and consequences of climate change in its full complexity are difficult for individuals, especially non-scientists, to grasp. Science education is a field which can play a crucial role in fostering meaningful education of students to become climate literate citizens (e.g., NOAA 2009; Schreiner et al., 41, 3–50, 2005). If students are, at some point, to participate in societal discussions about the sustainable development of our planet, their learning with respect to such issues needs to be supported. This includes the ability to think critically, to cope with complex scientific evidence, which is often subject to ongoing inquiry, and to reach informed decisions on the basis of factual information as well as values-based considerations. The study presented in this paper focused on efforts to advance students in (1) their conceptual understanding about climate change and (2) their socioscientific reasoning and decision making regarding socioscientific issues in general. Although there is evidence that “knowledge” does not guarantee pro-environmental behavior (e.g. Schreiner et al., 41, 3–50, 2005; Skamp et al., 97(2), 191–217, 2013), conceptual, interdisciplinary understanding of climate change is an important prerequisite to change individuals’ attitudes towards climate change and thus to eventually foster climate literate citizens (e.g., Clark et al. 2013). In order to foster conceptual understanding and socioscientific reasoning, a computer-based learning environment with an embedded concept mapping tool was utilized to support senior high school students’ learning about climate change and possible solution strategies. The evaluation of the effect of different concept mapping scaffolds focused on the quality of student-generated concept maps, as well as on students’ test performance with respect to conceptual knowledge as well as socioscientific reasoning and socioscientific decision making. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Teachers make a difference for the outcome of their students in science classrooms. One focus in this context lies on teachers’ professional knowledge. We describe this knowledge according to three domains, namely (1) content knowledge (CK), (2) pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and (3) curricular knowledge (CuK). We hypothesise a positive relationship between these three domains and students’ performance in science. Students’ science performance was conceptualised by system thinking performance in the context of biology teaching. In order to test our hypothesis, we examined the relationship between the knowledge triplet CK, PCK, and CuK and students’ performance. 48 biology teachers and their students (N = 1036) participated in this study. Teachers’ content-related professional knowledge and students’ performance were measured by paper-and-pencil tests. Moreover, we used concept maps to further assess students’ performance. By specifying doubly latent models, we found a significant positive relationship between biology teachers’ PCK and students’ performance. On the contrary, the results reveal no relationship between CK and CuK and students’ performance. These findings are discussed in respect to modelling the interrelationship of teachers’ content-related professional knowledge and students’ learning in science, as well as concerning their relevance for further research and teacher education programmes. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - In this study, Turkish prospective elementary science teachers’ understanding of photosynthesis and cellular respiration has been analysed within the contexts of ecosystem knowledge, organism knowledge and interconnection knowledge (IK). In the analysis, concept maps developed by 74 prospective teachers were used. The study was carried out with prospective teachers in their final year who were enrolled in the special teaching methods course. The results show that prospective teachers’ understanding of photosynthesis, cellular respiration, energy flow and matter cycling is quite different from one another’s. In addition, the present study revealed that prospective elementary science teachers showed weak understanding of energy flow and matter, cycling and cellular respiration concepts and IK category but they had strong understanding of photosynthesis concept. Prospective teachers also experience difficulties in understanding connections between macro- and microbiological systems. The study concludes with suggestions for more meaningful biology education. © 2016 Royal Society of Biology.

AB  - To date, the standard quantitative questionnaire has been the 'go to' instrument for measuring impacts of space-related Education and Public Outreach (EPO). Although these instruments are well established, easy and inexpensive ways to measure large samples of participants, researchers in the field of EPO are increasingly pointing to the need for more sensitive instruments to evaluate the impacts of outreach efforts [1, 2]. We report on the development of a new instrument-a digital game-designed to measure the effectiveness of space EPO activities in achieving their scientific literacy objectives. The instrument uses choice-based assessment and Teachable Agents (TA) in a game-like interactive digital application. Choice-based assessment, developed by the Stanford Graduate School of Education, measures learning by evaluating the choices a participant makes, rather than their knowledge [3]. Also developed by Stanford Graduate School of Education, a Teachable Agent (TA) is a learning technology that uses the social metaphor of teaching a computer agent by creating a concept map that serves as the agent's 'brain'[3]. This game-like instrument measures the choices (concept maps) that participants make in 'teaching' their TA about the nature of science and scientific process. We can then use it to measure any changes in participant choices after participating in space EPO. The concept map components and concepts available to participants in the game, as well as related assessment scales, derive from various existing instruments that have been tested for reliability and validity, including: the Student Understanding of Science and Scientific Inquiry (SUSSI) questionnaire [4] and the Trust in Science and Scientists (TSSI) questionnaire [5]. Demographic questions about participants' gender, age, level of education, level of science education and area of work are also included in the instrument. Copyright © 2017 by I. Kingsley.

AB  - Although studies repeatedly show both the importance of teachers’ science subject matter knowledge (SMK) and the fact that teachers have limited SMK, there are few opportunities for teachers to formally enhance their understanding of science after entering the classroom. Therefore, there is significant need for teachers to develop their SMK through classroom experience. In this longitudinal study, we explore the development of new secondary science teachers’ SMK by analyzing concept maps constructed in their 1st year of teaching and in their 5th year of teaching. We present a scoring system that reliably accounts for both the quality of connections and knowledge structure. Based on the findings presented, we conclude that these new chemistry teachers’ SMK did not change significantly from their 1st year of teaching to their 5th year of teaching. Implications for teacher educators and future research are presented. © 2017 Association for Science Teacher Education.

AB  - Context: concept Maps (CMs) enable the creation of a schematic representation of a domain knowledge. For this reason, CMs have been applied in different research areas, including Computer Science. Objective: the objective of this paper is to present the results of a systematic mapping study conducted to collect and evaluate existing research on CMs initiatives in Computer Science. Method: the mapping study was performed by searching five electronic databases. We also performed backward snowballing and manual search to find publications of researchers and research groups that accomplished these studies. Results: from the mapping study, we identified 108 studies addressing CMs initiatives in different subareas of Computer Science that were reviewed to extract relevant information to answer a set of research questions. The mapping shows an increasing interest in the topic in recent years and it has been extensively investigated due to support in teaching and learning. Conclusions: based on our results we conclude that the use of CMs as an educational tool has been widely accepted in Computer Science. © 2017 Vilnius University.

AB  - This study explored the effects of a collaborative computer-based concept mapping strategy on Geographic Science learning outcomes in junior high school students. A quasi-experimental approach was applied to a sample of 85 9th grade students. Class instruction lasted for five weeks, with two classes each week. Using the quasi-experimental research approach, 27 students were assigned to a constructive activities group that received instruction without concept mapping assistance (NCM), 28 students were assigned to a group that received individual computer-based concept mapping (CBCM) assisted instruction, and 30 students were assigned to a group that received collaborative computer-based concept mapping (CCBCM) assisted instruction. We explored the impact of these methods of instruction on students' memorization, understanding, and application of concepts and on their higher order cognitive ability. The findings revealed that the CCBCM and CBCM groups scored better than the NCM group on the post-test. On the retention test, the CCBCM group outperformed the NCM group on all subtests. © 2017 Authors.

AB  - This work presents a proposal for the teaching-learning of the concept map technique applied to the Natural Sciences course in the second year of Compulsory Secondary Education (ESO, according to its initials in Spanish). Two sessions have been designed, one of which is an instructor-led session to learn the technique and another is a session in which the students independently create a concept map, applying what they have learned in the previous session. To determine the effectiveness of the proposal, the concept maps created by the students during the two sessions have been evaluated, the grades obtained on the assessment tests for the unit before the concept map experience have been compared to those obtained on the assessment tests for the unit carried out using this technique, and a survey was written to find out the level of student satisfaction with the training received and the usefulness of the concept map technique. The results show that more than 65% of students earned grades between 7 and 9.5 on the concept maps created independently during the two academic years in which the proposal has been implemented. The study carried out allows us to conclude that the students have learned how to create concept maps, and evidences the usefulness of the methodology used and the need to implement more sessions for the creation of concept maps in the Natural Sciences course so that this technique is transformed into a learning strategy. The students have expressed a high level of satisfaction with the training received and the tool they have learned how to use.

AB  - Both, teachers and researchers, agree that in order to teach related content to science with high quality, is necessary in advance have not only a proper understanding of science content, but of the nature of science too, so the initial teacher training should address this issue explicitly. In this paper we present and analyze the implementation of a teaching and learning sequence in a preservice teachers class, which it allows us to see, through models produced successively by the participants, how progress the ideas regarding one of the questions that the nature of scientific knowledge must deal: how this knowledge is constructed. It became evident the overcoming of several obstacles that create a false image of science. The results show how the progression of students' ideas in this domain entails overcoming several obstacles that create a wrong image of science, such as the empiricist idea, individualistic, absolutist or others, favoring to build a set of ideas closer to the desirables.

AB  - Four graphs for personalized study planning constitute the personalized study planning framework, namely, a graph representing a conceptual structure of study program; a graph representing study course; a graph visualizing each topic of study course using concept map; a graph representing learning objects. This paper deals with the third graph - a graph displaying study course topic structure and knowledge assessment. Authors describe concept map based knowledge evaluation system integration possibilities with personalized study planning prototype and usage in personal study planning. In order to perform the structure analysis of the concept maps authors propose to use of the methods of structure analysis to calculate the ranks for the nodes of the graphs thus detecting the most significant nodes in the graph structure. The calculation of ranks for the graph nodes allows detecting the most essential concepts in the concept map. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - A common hypothesis is that students will more deeply understand dynamic systems and other complex phenomena if they construct computational models of them. Attempts to demonstrate the advantages of model construction have been stymied by the long time required for students to acquire skill in model construction. In order to make model construction a feasible vehicle for science instruction, the Dragoon system combined three simplifications: (1) a simple notation for models of dynamic systems, (2) a step-based tutoring system, and (3) problems that described the model to be constructed as well as the system represented by the model. In order to test whether these simplifications reduced the time for learning how to construct models while preserving the benefits of model construction over baseline instruction, three classroom studies were conducted. All studies were experiments, in that they compared classes using Dragoon to classes learning the same material without Dragoon. However, as classroom studies, they could not tightly control all sources of variation. The first study produced null results, but it compared learning across just one class period. The second study in 4 high school science classes showed that instruction based on Dragoon cost only one extra class period (about 50 min) out of 4 class periods and was more effective than the same content taught without Dragoon. A third study in 3 more high school science classes, where 2 Dragoon classes and 1 non-Dragoon class met for the same number of class periods, showed that Dragoon was more effective than the same content taught without Dragoon. The effect sizes were moderately large on both an open response test (d = 1.00) and a concept mapping task (d = 0.49). Thus, it appears that our efforts have simplified model construction to the point that it can be used in science instruction with no additional class time needed, and yet it still seems to be more effective than the same instruction done without model construction. © 2016, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

AB  - Explicit visual representations of domain knowledge have the potential to support students engaged in scientific inquiry learning activities on an epistemic level. This can be facilitated using computational methods for the extraction of concepts from student generated knowledge artefacts such as hypotheses, concept maps, or wiki articles. We propose an application of this approach in the context of inquiry learning with online science laboratories. As a cognitive awareness tool, the "concept cloud" presents domain concepts and key phrases to the learners in order to help them reflect on their own learning and knowledge building. As part of a learning analytics toolset, the concept cloud also supports teachers in supervising their students' knowledge building from an epistemic perspective. The approach has been tested in a classroom scenario with 84 secondary high school students. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Preserving important troubleshooting experience gained in industrial practice, often referred to as "tribal knowledge", and making it readily available to be re-applied in similar situations represent a serious challenge for many companies in heavy industry. The solution is very often tied to building mental models to capture and express key latent cognitive variables. In this paper, we first attempt to identify the appropriate knowledge-based system diagnosis paradigms. A conceptual map-based framework is then proposed as a potential solution for retaining tribal knowledge. The validity and feasibility of the approach are demonstrated through a training program developed under the support of National Science Foundation (NSF) for improving engineering and technology students' troubleshooting skills. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - This pilot study investigates the impact of a 2-week professional development Summer Institute on PK-3 teachers’ knowledge and practices. This Summer Institute is a component of [program], a large-scale early-childhood science project that aims to transform PK-3 science teaching. The mixed-methods study examined concept maps, lesson plans, and classroom observations to measure possible changes in PK-3 teachers’ science content knowledge and classroom practice from 11 teachers who attended the 2014 Summer Institute. Analysis of the concept maps demonstrated statistically significant growth in teachers’ science content knowledge. Analysis of teachers’ lesson plans demonstrated that the teachers could design high quality science inquiry lessons aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards following the professional development. Finally, examination of teachers’ pre- and post-Summer Institute videotaped inquiry lessons showed evidence that teachers were incorporating new inquiry practices into their teaching, especially regarding classroom discourse. Our results suggest that an immersive inquiry experience is effective at beginning a shift towards reform-aligned science and engineering instruction but that early elementary educators require additional support for full mastery. © 2016, The Association for Science Teacher Education, USA.

AB  - The exponential growth of scientific literature – which we call the ‘big literature’ phenomenon – has created great challenges in literature comprehension and synthesis. The traditional manual literature synthesis processes are often unable to take advantage of big literature due to human limitations in time and cognition, creating the need for new literature synthesis methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we discuss a highly useful literature synthesis approach, automated content analysis (ACA), which has not yet been widely adopted in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. ACA is a suite of machine learning tools for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of big literature commonly used in the social sciences and in medical research. Our goal is to introduce ecologists and evolutionary biologists to ACA and illustrate its capacity to synthesize overwhelming volumes of literature. First, we provide a brief history of the ACA method and summarize the fundamental process of ACA. Next, we present two ACA studies to illustrate the utility and versatility of ACA in synthesizing ecological and evolutionary literature. Finally, we discuss how to maximize the utility and contributions of ACA, as well as potential research directions that may help to advance the use of ACA in future ecological and evolutionary research. Unlike manual methods of literature synthesis, ACA is able to process high volumes of literature at substantially shorter time spans, while helping to mitigate human biases. The overall efficiency and versatility of this method allow for a broad range of applications for literature review and synthesis, including both exploratory reviews and systematic reviews aiming to address more targeted research questions. By allowing for more extensive and comprehensive reviews of big literature, ACA has the potential to fill an important methodological gap and therefore contribute to the advancement of ecological and evolutionary research. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - This article considers what might be taught to meet a widely held curriculum aim of students being able to understand research in a discipline. Expertise, which may appear as a ‘chain of practice’, is widely held to be underpinned by networks of understanding. Scientific research expertise is considered from this perspective. Within scientific disciplines, how research is conducted to solve different problems varies with concomitant effects on the validity of the data and the strengths of the claims made. Despite this variation, the overarching concepts of validity and reliability and the underpinning and interrelated network of more specific ‘concepts of evidence’ are applicable to understanding a wide range of research designs and the uncertainties in the resultant data and claims. These constituent ideas, which inter alia have been validated as relevant to professional and academic expertise, form an integrated knowledge base about evidence which can be visualised on a concept map. The network of ideas underpinning research expertise across scientific disciplines is outlined. Research from explicitly teaching the concepts of evidence is reported, and the implications for teaching and learning in science-based disciplines in HE are considered. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of using Google Docs in collaborative concept mapping (CCM) by comparing it with a paper-and-pencil approach. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in a physics course. The control group drew concept maps using the paper-and-pencil method and face-to-face discussion, whereas the experimental group employed Google Docs to create concept maps and used Google Chat for discussion. Learning achievements, physics concept representation, attitudes toward science, and attitudes toward CCM were examined to identify the differences between the two groups and the effectiveness of Google Docs. The results suggested that the use of Google Docs did not significantly affect physics achievement. However, Google Docs fostered physics concept representation and enhanced attitudes toward science. Moreover, the Google Docs group tended to learn more collaboratively. The students in this group also agreed with the superiority of observation and modification functions provided by the real-time co-editing mechanism and revision history. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This descriptive study examines online assessment strategies employed by preservice teacher candidates when creating thematic learning experiences in online teaching environments. Using the learning management system Moodle as part of their innovative training, this review of a sample of 395 candidate-created instructional units across all grades and most subject areas examines their use of a variety of assessment instruments to gather both formative and summative data. The large data set allowed the researcher to infer the teacher candidates' understanding of the value of different assessment types and their use in an assessment strategy for the unit. Learning management systems have many built-in affordances, including the ability for teachers to make quizzes, host discussion forums, use concept mapping, and facilitate collaborative projects using multimedia as well as text. In this study, the majority of students cautiously made use of more traditional tools such as quizzes and reports without taking full advantage of the power and potential of collaborative and creative potential in the development of authentic assessments. Analysis of these data showed that teacher candidates at the upper elementary level and in subjects like Science and Language Arts made far greater use of open-ended summative assessment activities than did other subgroupings. © 2016, © 2016 ISTE.

AB  - Nurses confront complex problems and decisions that require critical thinking in order to identify patient needs and implement best practices. An active strategy for teaching students the skills to think critically is the concept map. This study explores the development of critical thinking among nursing students in a required pathophysiology and pharmacology course during the first year of a Bachelor of Science in Nursing in response to concept mapping as an interventional strategy, using the Health Education Systems, Incorporated critical thinking test. A two-group experimental study with a pretest and posttest design was used. Participants were randomly divided into a control group (n = 42) taught by traditional didactic lecturing alone, and an intervention group (n = 41), taught by traditional didactic lecturing with concept mapping. Students in the concept mapping group performed much better on the Health Education Systems, Incorporated than students in the control group. It is recommended that deans, program directors, and nursing faculties evaluate their curricula to integrate concept map teaching strategies in courses in order to develop critical thinking abilities in their students. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - Background: Enhancing students’ metacognitive abilities will help to facilitate their understanding of science concepts. Purpose: The study was designed to conduct and evaluate the effectiveness of a repertoire of interventions aimed at enhancing secondary school students’ metacognitive capabilities and their achievements in science. Sample: A class of 35 Year 9 students participated in the study. Design and methods: The study involved a pre-post design, conducted by the first author as part of the regular designated science programme in a class taught by him. In order to enhance the students’ metacognitive capabilities, the first author employed clearly stated focused outcomes, engaging them in collaborative group work, reading scientific texts and using concept mapping techniques during classroom instruction. The data to evaluate the effectiveness of the metacognitive interventions were obtained from pre- and post-test results of two metacognitive questionnaires, the Metacognitive Support Questionnaire (MSpQ) and the Metacognitive Strategies Questionnaire (MStQ), and data from interviews. In addition, pre-test and post-test scores were used from a two-tier multiple-choice test on Light. Results: The results showed gains in the MSpQ but not in the MStQ. However, the qualitative data from interviews suggested high metacognitive capabilities amongst the high- and average-achieving students at the end of the study. Students gains were also evident from the test scores in the Light test. Conclusion: Although the quantitative data obtained from the Metacognitive Strategies Questionnaire did not show significant gains in the students’ metacognitive strategies, the qualitative data from interviews suggested positive perceptions of students’ metacognitive strategies amongst the high- and average-achieving students. Data from the Metacognitive Support Questionnaire showed that there were significant gains in the students’ perceptions of their metacognitive support implying that the majority of the students perceived that their learning environment was oriented towards the development of their metacognitive capabilities. The effect of the metacognitive interventions on students’ achievement in the Light test resulted in students displaying the correct declarative knowledge, but quite often they lacked the procedural knowledge by failing to explain their answers correctly. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The value of course evaluations has been debated since they frequently fail to capture the complexity of education and learning. Group Concept Mapping (GCM), a participant-centred mixed-method was explored as a tool for evaluation and development in nursing education and to better understand students' learning experiences, using data from a GCM-based evaluation of a research training assignment integrating clinical practice and research data collection within a Swedish university nursing program. Student nurses (n = 47) participated in a one-day GCM exercise. Focus group brainstorming regarding experiences from the assignment that the students considered important and instructive yielded 98 statements that were individually sorted based on their student-perceived relationships, and rated regarding their importance/instructiveness and need for development. Quantitative analysis of sort data produced a 2-dimensional map representing their conceptual relationships, and eight conceptual areas. Average cluster ratings were plotted relative to each other and provided a decision aid for development and planning by identifying areas (i.e., “Research methodology”, “Patients' perspectives”, and “Interviewer role”) considered highly important/instructive and in high need for development. These experiences illustrate the use and potential of GCM as an interactive participant-centred approach to evaluation, planning and development in nursing and other higher health science educations. © 2016

AB  - Among policy makers, there is an ongoing discussion about the need to improve undergraduate education in science and engineering. With many undergraduate students being taught by graduate teaching assistants (GTAs), it is important to explore the development of STEM knowledge for teaching by GTAs. This study follows ten GTAs as they participated in a GTA teaching program that included attending a “Scientific Teaching” course. Data collection consisted of open-ended questionnaires and concept maps. Analysis revealed that a majority of the GTAs employed more didactic, teacher-centered practices while having varied levels of development in the areas of student understanding and instructional strategies. Those GTAs with regularly scheduled opportunities to work directly with students increased their knowledge for teaching. Additionally, GTAs with lower levels of prior teaching experience and an expressed desire to improve their teaching had the highest levels of knowledge development. From this study, we suggest that GTA programs support GTAs by initiating the preparation for teaching early in the TA experience. Finally, we recommend that science departments place more emphasis on teaching by providing GTAs with additional science education coursework as well as structured opportunities to work directly with students and to practice making use of reformed teaching strategies. © 2016, Arizona State University.

AB  - A value-centered approach to science, technology and society (STS) education illuminates the need of reflexive and relational learning through communication and public engagement. Visualization is a key to represent and compare mental models such as assumptions, background theories and value systems that tacitly shape our own understanding, interests and interactions. Yet conventional approaches including concept mapping and multi-criteria value elicitation methods often have little suggestion or implication as to how participants themselves can address and deliberate the incompatibility of their perceptions, preferences and perspectives. This study proposes Q workshop as a legitimate eliciting and deliberation technique that can be employed in pluralistic discourse, exploring systematic divergences of perspective by constructing the participant‘s self in a formative, emergent and contingent manner. For this it introduces Q mapping as a novel visualization tool for the hybridity of qualitative and quantitative methods derived from Q methodology. Q mapping is a two-factor solution that transforms the similarities in participants’ individual Q scores into distances represented in two-dimensional space, for the sake of illustrating the relative positioning and partitioning of perspectives in a schematic figure. A case study on STS education for postgraduate students demonstrates that Q workshop can play a heuristic and abductive role in providing independent illumination of distinguishable perspectives and facilitating individual and collective learning among participants, suggesting a schematic two-dimensional basis for resolving the key differences. © 2016 The Author.

AB  - To determine the content of integrated curricula, clinical concepts and the underlying basic science concepts need to be made explicit. Preconstructed concept maps are recommended for this purpose. They are mainly constructed by experts. However, concept maps constructed by residents are hypothesized to be less complex, to reveal more tacit basic science concepts and these basic science concepts are expected to be used for the organization of the maps. These hypotheses are derived from studies about knowledge development of individuals. However, integrated curricula require a high degree of cooperation between clinicians and basic scientists. This study examined whether there are consistent variations regarding the articulation of integration when groups of experienced clinicians and basic scientists and groups of residents and basic scientists-in-training construct concept maps. Seven groups of three clinicians and basic scientists on experienced level and seven such groups on resident level constructed concept maps illuminating clinical problems. They were guided by instructions that focused them on articulation of integration. The concept maps were analysed by features that described integration. Descriptive statistics showed consistent variations between the two expertise levels. The concept maps of the resident groups exceeded those of the experienced groups in articulated integration. First, they used significantly more links between clinical and basic science concepts. Second, these links connected basic science concepts with a greater variety of clinical concepts than the experienced groups. Third, although residents did not use significantly more basic science concepts, they used them significantly more frequent to organize the clinical concepts. The conclusion was drawn that not all hypotheses could be confirmed and that the resident concept maps were more elaborate than expected. This article discusses the implications for the role that residents and basic scientists-in-training might play in the construction of preconstructed concept maps and the development of integrated curricula. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Computer hardware and mobile devices have developed rapidly in recent years, and augmented reality (AR) technology has been increasingly applied in mobile learning. Although instructional AR applications have yielded satisfactory results and prompted students’ curiosity and interest, a number of problems remain. The crucial topic for AR applications is the lack of appropriate instructional scaffolds to help students organize the content to be learned. Moreover, a lack of appropriate instructional activities and scaffolds often results in student confusion and frustration. Therefore, we integrated AR with concept maps to form a concept-mapped AR (CMAR) scaffold. Subsequently, whether CMAR improves learning outcomes, motivation, and attitude in mobile learning activities was determined. An empirical study was conducted on 71 fifth-grade elementary students in Southern Taiwan. The students were divided into CMAR and AR system groups. The results showed that students in the CMAR group performed significantly better than those in the AR group. The student interview results also showed that the CMAR system helped students organize what they wanted to learn. © 2016, De La Salle University.

Grade 7 students’ posttest performances on the light unit achievement and light unit attitude tests controlled for gender, previous semester science grade, and pretest scores were analyzed. No significant treatment effects were found between the inquiry and expository approaches. However, both groups demonstrated significant pretest–posttest gains in achievement and attitude. Independent from the method used, ONACOM was judged effective in both groups as students demonstrated increased achievement and attitude scores. ONACOM has a social and semantic network-aided infrastructure that can be adapted to both methods to increase students’ achievement and improve their attitude. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - As a graphical tool for knowledge organization, representation, and elicitation, concept mapping has received growing attention and application in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines as an effective instructional strategy to improve student conceptual understanding. This paper reports how the concept mapping approach was employed in a foundational undergraduate engineering dynamics course. In this course, students (rather than the instructor) developed their concept maps to illustrate the evolution of key concepts in engineering dynamics. Data were collected from students who took an engineering dynamics course in recent two semesters: Semester I when concept mapping was not employed and Semester II when concept mapping was employed. The results show that as compared to Semester I, students developed better conceptual understanding in Semester II. Four representative examples of concept maps generated by students in Semester II are presented in this paper. A representative set of student comments are also presented, which demonstrate how the concept mapping approach helped students develop better conceptual understanding. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.

AB  - The term sustainability is over-used and often misused in society. Further, sustainability and sustainable engineering are complex topics. This research explored how first year engineering students define these complex ideas, and the impacts of two different instructional methods on their ideas. Sustainability knowledge was evaluated using concept maps. Students' initial ideas about sustainability were explored based on concept maps that individual students generated in-class. This was followed by two different instruction methods. Civil and architectural engineering students in a two-credit first year introduction to engineering course learned about sustainable engineering rating systems in a two-week module; they repeated the concept map as part of the graded homework assignment on sustainability. This course was compared to a 1-credit seminar-style introductory sustainability course that focused on the social sciences aspects of sustainability over the whole semester via a series of readings and in-class discussions; these seminar students repeated the concept map as part of their final exam. The concept maps were scored by counting the number of individual concepts, cross-links, and highest hierarchy; these metrics were also combined into a total weighted score. Beyond these basic quantitative measures, the distribution of sustainability concepts across the three pillars of environmental, social, and economic issues was also determined. The in-class "pre" concept maps showed significant variability in students' sustainability knowledge, ranging from 3 to 34 concepts, 0 to 16 cross-links, hierarchical depth of 1 to 7, and total scores of 9 to 192. Students in both the civil & architectural engineering class (n=72) and the sustainability seminar course (n=44) had improved sustainability concept maps after instruction. Categorical scoring found that environmental aspects comprised the highest percentage of the concepts on both the pre- and post-instruction concept maps. However, the post-instruction concept maps in both courses had significantly higher percentages of both social and economic aspects compared to the preconcept maps. This indicates that students achieved both a richer and a more balanced understanding of sustainability. There were somewhat larger increases in the number of social and economic concepts on the concept maps of students in the sustainability seminar course as compared to the civil & architectural engineering course. This difference was expected based on the focus and greater depth of sustainability instruction in the seminar course. The concept maps seemed useful to judge the success of different instructional methods, and provided an assessment of students' sustainability knowledge. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.

AB  - Using multiple representations and argumentation are two fundamental processes in science. With the advancements of information communication technologies, these two processes are blended more so than ever before. However, little is known about how these two processes interact with each other in student learning. Hence, we conducted a design-based study in order to distill the relationship between these two processes. Specifically, we designed a learning unit on nuclear energy and implemented it with a group of preservice middle school teachers. The participants used a web-based knowledge organization platform that incorporated three representational modes: textual, concept map, and pictorial. The participants organized their knowledge on nuclear energy by searching, sorting, clustering information through the use of these representational modes and argued about the nuclear energy issue. We found that the use of multiple representations and argumentation interacted with each other in a complex way. Based on our findings, we argue that the complexity can be unfolded in two aspects: (a) the use of multiple representations mediates argumentation in different forms and for different purposes; (b) the type of argumentation that leads to refinement of the use of multiple representations is often non-mediated and drawn from personal experience. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this paper a research about the influence of concept mapping in teacher training programs is presented. A methodological proposal based on the STSE approach (science, technology, society and environment relationships) is described. It tries to promote meaningful learning, team work, communication abilities and teaching abilities. For that purpose, the analysis of documents related to climate change and concept mapping, with the software CmapTools, have been used. The results show that preservice teachers learn easily to create concept maps from the analysis of texts related to educational topics and that they value in a positive way the educational experience developed.

AB  - This classroom action research was conducted to analyze the development of the students’ inquiry abilities in science learning by a learning model of mindmap educative by using game observation normatively (Megono). The study was conducted in three cycles. In each cycle, the students were divided into five groups, each groups consisted of seven students. Each group was mandated to observe and to analyze the images/photos. After the image observations, they were asked to discuss, write and compile the information into a concept map. One of the students was act as a representative of the group in a game of observation. Data were obtained through the pre-test, post-test, and observation by the observers as well as from the photo and video recording. The results showed that the students’ inquiry ability increased by 63.27% at the end of the cycle. At the initial conditions, the ability of the student was low (0.49). After the first cycle, it increased to 0.63 (medium), and then increased to 0.68 (moderate) on the second cycle, and finally it increased to 0.80 (high) in the third cycle. The average increase in every aspect was 68.59%. The highest inquiry capability was achieved in aspects of reasoning amounted to 89.29 (very high). It was suggested to use the observation games fairly and needed more time adjustment to obtain higher learning outcomes. © 2016 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.

AB  - An important stage in any research inquiry is the development of research questions that need to be answered. The strategies to develop research questions should be defined and described, but few studies have considered this process in greater detail. This study explores pre-service science teachers’ research questions and the strategies they can engage in during inquiry. A total of 59 pre-service science teachers who attended an undergraduate Fieldwork Course participated in the study. A single, holistic case study design was used along with an open-ended questionnaire and documents for data collection. The questionnaire was conducted at the end of the course, and documented inquiry reports were analyzed. The results indicate there are 11 methods for defining driving questions. These range from consulting an instructor to group discussion; 21 different strategies can be produced using these methods. These research question defining methods and strategies should be applied as a coding scheme for future studies and expanded. Any research question defining strategies unfamiliar to pre-service science teachers, such as field trips, brainstorming, and concept maps, should then be taught. © 2016 by author/s.

AB  - Despite recent advances in undergraduate medical education, integration of vertical curricula and simultaneous delivery of competencies remain challenging. To address this educational challenge, we delivered a series of case-based exercises to a combined class of M1 and M2 students to achieve vertical (year-to-year) and horizontal (clinical and basic science) integration. These exercises consisted of a case, concept mapping activity to link basic science content to an underlying symptom, and follow-up discussion. Following the activities, students were asked to complete a survey evaluating the effectiveness of their experience including level of learning, effectiveness of peer teaching, and incorporation of core competencies. Overall, the students described the activity positively (informative and engaging). M1 students reported regularly helping M2 students review the M1 material. Unsurprisingly, the M2 students assisted the M1 students with the M2 material to a greater extent and significantly improved the M1 students’ confidence with that material. The M2 students generally felt successful in peer teaching but reported that it regularly revealed intrinsic knowledge gaps. As important, this activity reportedly addressed competencies in addition to Medical Knowledge, specifically Communication Skills, Practice-Based Learning, and Professionalism. In summary, this learning activity provided opportunities for students to (1) refine clinical reasoning and peer-peer teaching skills, (2) reinforce the basic science content within a clinical context, and (3) integrate several additional key core competencies into the heavily Medical-Knowledge-focused pre-clerkship curriculum. This novel activity facilitated vertical and horizontal integration of several key core competencies in a manner that could be incorporated and assessed in nearly any curricular structure. © 2015, International Association of Medical Science Educators.

AB  - The amount of substance and its unit the mole is a basic concept in chemistry. However, previous research has shown that teaching and learning the concept are challenging tasks for both teachers and students. The purpose of this study was to pinpoint the problems which emerge in the teaching and learning process, and provide integrated suggestions for classroom instruction. By means of videotaping and interviews, the case studies explored how the mole is presented and conceptualized in two secondary classrooms in two different countries, Australia and Taiwan. Data analysis was based on a concept map and focused on how two key ideas were presented in the lessons and perceived by the students: (1) the definition of the mole, and (2) the concept of molar mass. The findings show that during the lessons on the mole, most of the time was spent on solving stoichiometric problems. Conceptually, the number aspect of the mole, that is, Avogadro's number, was emphasized; the concept of molar mass was introduced without meaningfully connecting it to the concept of relative atomic/molecular mass. Although the students were able to solve relevant problems, they could not coherently explain the relations among the concepts. Two critical components for a conceptual understanding of the mole emerged: (1) the number aspect of the mole needs to be justified by its mass aspect, and (2) the connection between molar mass and relative atomic/molecular mass needs to be explicitly explained. The two components provide one explanation for students' algorithmic learning and their confusion in learning about the mole, and serve as concrete suggestions for improving classroom instruction. The study once again manifested the significance of teaching for conceptual understanding in science education. It also exemplifies how a concept map of a specific scientific concept can also be a useful analytical tool in educational research. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - To date, a look at the scientific literature on the construction and use of synchronous computer-mediated communication (CMC) support environments reveals that most researchers have focused either on exchanging information or on constructing and presenting posts. In this work, an intelligent collaborative synchronous CMC platform that detects whether the learners address the expected discussion issues is proposed. The concept maps related to the learning topics are first outlined by the instructor. After each learner issues a post on the synchronous CMC platform, a feature selection approach is adopted to derive the input parameters of a one-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifier. The classifier then determines if the learners' posts are related to the concept maps previously outlined by the instructor. Meanwhile, learner peers from the same group are asked to provide comments on the synchronous CMCs, and a group grading module is established in this work to evaluate the quality of the synchronous CMCs. If the evaluation results from the classifier and the group grading module are inconsistent, the instructor or the teaching assistant is consulted to verify the evaluation results. Notably, a feedback rule construction mechanism is used to issue feedback messages to learners in cases where the synchronous CMC support system detects that the learners have strayed astray from the expected learning topics in their posts. The classification rates for the one-class SVM classifier can reach up to 97.06%, and the average pre-test and post-test grades were 51.94 and 66.77, respectively, which revealed that the junior high school students participating in synchronous CMC activities related to natural science were benefited by the proposed intelligent synchronous CMC platform. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Digital games have become a popular source of entertainment. The main reason that players continue to play video games is that the game designers use scaffolding to bridge the gap between a player's current skills and those needed to be successful at the next level. Several mainstream digital games have the flexibility to become promising game-based learning environments, in which scaffolding could play a crucial role to improve the learning experience. This study examines the effectiveness of providing instructors with the opportunity to tailor a digital game in order to meet their personal teaching goals. The built-in game features in Crayon Physics Deluxe are blended with instructor-designed scaffolding to see whether such features can assist learning without impeding creativity. A total of 126 participants were divided into four groups. In three of the groups, Crayon Physics Deluxe was used with varied scaffolding conditions: demonstration scaffolding, non-scaffolding, and marking critical features scaffolding. The fourth group did not play the game. Learning outcomes were examined in terms of physics knowledge acquisition (in the form of concept maps) and creativity performance (in the form of game episode designs). The results show that the marking critical features scaffolding group performed significantly better than the demonstration scaffolding group in both conceptual knowledge acquisition and in the sensitivity dimension of design creativity. The group with demonstration scaffolding scored higher in the flexibility dimension of creativity when designing their own game episodes. These findings suggest that proper scaffolding does facilitate learning, and different learning purposes require various designs of scaffoldings. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Having students inspect and use each other's work is a promising way to advance inquiry-based science learning. Research has nevertheless shown that additional guidance is needed for students to take full advantage of the work produced by their peers. The present study investigated whether scaffolding through an integrated support tool could bring about the desired effect. This tool was embedded in an online inquiry learning environment and outlined the steps in searching for information in peer-created concept maps. It also contained specific directions to assess the quality of the retrieved information. The effectiveness of this search guidance tool was investigated during an inquiry-based science project. Main results indicated that high school students who were supported by the tool (n =19) developed a more differentiated and interconnected conceptual understanding than students who did not receive this scaffold (n =23). However, the search guidance tool also seemed to put additional demands on students' self-regulatory abilities, and might therefore require some practice or regulatory support to reach its full potential. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Spatial representations have been considered for their high didactical efficacy, as concept maps and mind maps. Graphical and spatial representations may be seen as key elements of knowledge management and may contribute to enhancing spatial knowledge. Even if isomorphisms between the physical and the mental dimension can be controversial in the field of spatial knowledge, it is nevertheless interesting to study the role of spatial interpretation in knowledge management processes. In science education, spatial skills are actually highly required due to the development of new technologies and their highly demanding spatial tasks they often work intertwined with other abilities, such as logical reasoning and verbal skills. Despite spatial knowledge being significative in the overall field of learning management, there is instead little research that shows its complex role in the comprehension of concepts in the humanistic fields, e.g. in philosophical conceptual reasoning. The Elementary Logic Theory—which underlies the philosophical maps of this Atlas—identifies at the basis of complex thinking prototypical knowledge units that may be activated in the possible collaboration between explicit and implicit thinking. In EL Theory, spatiality is considered the most suitable transition format for the hypothesized collaboration between implicit and explicit processing because it shares common aspects with both of them. The focus of EL Theory is to research particularly the role of the implicit in knowledge comprehension through spatial representations. In this Atlas, the role of Elementary Logic Theory is highlighted in shaping philosophical knowledge and comprehension of philosophical concepts and their intertwining. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - We have already proposed a framework of kit-build concept map where a learner is provided a set of parts of a concept map and is requested to build a concept map by composing the parts. In this framework, a build map by a learner is able to be diagnosed automatically. The kit-building task of a concept map is a promising exercise for strengthening and assessing learner's comprehension for a topic that a learner already has learnt. We have implemented an interactive learning environment based on the framework and practically used the environment in several schools. In this paper, in order to investigate the value of the kit-building task of a concept map, we compare it with multiple-choice task of fill-in-The-blank questions. The multiple choice task of fill-in-The-blank questions is also used to strengthen and assess learner's comprehension, and the answer can be automatically evaluated. Then, the both task can be generated from the same series of propositions, that is, from the same contents. We have compared the two tasks through 3 lessons of science learning of 5th grade students in two classes. One class used KB map (KB class) and another class used Fill-In-The-Blank questions (FIB class). Individual student in both classes used a tablet PC. The tablet PC was connected to a server though wireless LAN and a teacher could receive the results of evaluations of the maps or answers' of the questions immediately. Based on the evaluation results, the teacher conducted additional teaching. As the results, the KB task evaluated learner's comprehension more adequately than the question task, and the students in the KB class had higher performance than the students in the question class.

AB  - This study sought to determine the levels of conceptual understanding of undergraduate students regarding organic compounds within different functional groups. A total of 60 students who were enrolled in the Department of Secondary Science and Mathematics Education of a Faculty of Education at a state university in Turkey and who had followed an Organic Chemistry Laboratory Course participated in the study. The data were collected using two tools: functional group worksheets and concept maps. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations were used in analyzing the data. The findings showed that the students generally had low levels of understanding of concepts relating to functional groups, and they exhibited a considerable number of misconceptions. Considering the findings more fully, it was determined that students have remarkable misconceptions and low levels of understanding about certain topics regarding functional groups, including the physical properties of functional groups, intermolecular bonds, acidity and basicity, reduction and oxidation, stereoisomerism and structural isomerism, and aromaticity and aliphaticity, as well as other organic chemistry concepts (e.g. decarboxylation, oxyacide, and phenol). The results suggest that since students are unable to adequately comprehend the subjects of general chemistry, such as intramolecular and intermolecular bonds, acidity and basicity, oxidation and reduction and determination of molecular structures, they fail to accurately transfer their knowledge to learning about organic chemistry. In order to promote students' understanding of functional groups and prevent related misconceptions, it is recommended that basic chemistry topics should be reinforced, and the relationship between students' current knowledge and the new information to be learned in organic chemistry should be emphasized with the help of activities in which various forms of thinking are used. ©2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The aim was to identify and synthesize research evidence about how adults and older adults process somatosensory information in daily activities, and the interventions available to regain somatosensory function following stroke. We developed two interacting concept maps to address the research questions. The scoping review was conducted from 2005 to 2015 across Web of Science, AMED, CINAHL, Embase, Medline, and PsychInfo databases. Search terms included somatosensory, perception, performance, participation, older adult, stroke, intervention, discrimination, learning, and neuroplasticity. Contributions from 103 articles for Concept 1 and 14 articles for Concept 2 are reported. Measures of somatosensory processing, performance, and participation used are identified. Interventions available to treat somatosensory loss are summarized in relation to approach, outcome measures, and theory/mechanisms underlying. A gap exists in the current understanding of how somatosensory function affects the daily lives of adults. A multidisciplinary approach that includes performance and participation outcomes is recommended to advance the field. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Concept mapping has been widely used in various fields to facilitate students' organization of knowledge. Previous studies have, however, pointed out that it is difficult for students to construct concept maps from the abundant searched data without appropriate scaffolding. Thus, researchers have suggested that students could produce high quality concept maps when they construct them with appropriate guidance. Accordingly, this study proposes a question prompt-based concept mapping approach, which was conducted in a computer course with a duration of 14 weeks on the research issue of global warming. There were 176 senior high school students from four classes who participated in the experiment. The study adopted a quasi-experimental design for the investigation of the effectiveness of the proposed approach; two classes were randomly assigned to be the experimental group, learning with the question prompt-based concept mapping approach, while the other two groups were the control group, who used the conventional concept mapping approach. The results indicated that the students in the experimental group had better performance than those in the control group in terms of their learning achievement, 5C competences, and learning attitudes. In addition, the results also showed that students with a reflective style had better learning achievement than those with an active style. Thus, it is worth investigating, for such an issue, how to propose more effective learning models for diverse student learning styles in the future. This can provide useful guidance for educators, practitioners and researchers in the areas of science education and computer-assisted education.

AB  - In this study it was aimed to investigate cognitive structures of pre-service science teachers in some basic chemistry terms via word association test. Data were analyzed according to the number of responses to each key word in the word association test and concept maps were drawn according to frequencies as well as relatedness coefficient. Results of this study showed that participants’ strongest part of cognitive structures within the given keywords was “compound-molecule” relation and they have weaknesses/difficulties in “ion” concept. It can be said that the abstract feature of the given concepts and the difficulties on understanding of macro and micro relations were effective on these results. Besides, according to sentence analysis participants were most likely to “define” and “describe” the knowledge but have difficulties on “comparing” and “interpreting” the knowledge. This study was conducted at the beginning of the chapter and cognitive structures of the pre-service science teachers were explored. Therefore course can be designed according to the findings of the study. © 2016, Ankara University. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article seeks to reflect on the teaching and practice of the use of conceptual modeling that can assist the teaching-learning process of students in the classes of Geography in schools of the educational system of the State of Piauí (Brazil). This research was developed with Geography teachers in a training course for teachers for the use of Geotechnologies and Tools of Web interaction within the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Piauí (Brazil). As found by the analysis of data collected in this investigation, teachers agree that conceptual modeling contributes to the organization of the geographic knowledge of students. And yet it was evident the use of concept maps as a teaching and learning strategy, as well as an evaluation tool for student performance. Finally, the use of concept maps in teaching Geography brings up the idea of the development and exercise of autonomy by the students, since self-study is one of the essential factors for meaningful learning of spatial content in classroom.

AB  - A comparative study was conducted between a traditional methodology for teaching scientific contents and an experimental methodology based on the construction of a didactic sequence using concept maps as a resource for teaching-learning. Four groups of students aged 9–10 were selected, two acting as Control Groups and two as Experimental Groups. The objective was to find out the differences between the selected educational methods, in terms of the learning that 4th grade students acquire. The results showed a higher degree of effectiveness on the teaching methods used in the EG against the methods used in the CG. Students in the CG did not remember on the long term the contents taught in a traditional way, which seems related to rote learning. By contrast, students using concept maps had a more meaningful learning. In conclusion, concept maps are an important resource for improving the acquisition of scientific knowledge in primary education. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Much research has been done on the application of concept maps as means for learning assessment. Similarly, different types of Concept-Map Based Assessments (CMBA) and their validity have been examined as well in many studies, but to a far less extent. The present study uses a descriptive quantitative method and mainly aims to put forward the idea that the select-and-fill-in (SAFI) concept maps could be used as a valid instrument to assess the conceptual understanding of science among thermodynamics students. For this purpose, the concurrent validity of the SAFI concept map was evaluated according to the last version of the Thermodynamic Concept Survey (TCS) in order to develop a standard conceptual survey in thermodynamics. The TCS has a total KR-20 of approximately 0.78, an acceptable value, which could be employed as a valid test to assess teacher-made SAFI concept maps. The study population includes 60 students from two physics classes. An evaluation of the conceptual understandings of thermodynamics students were made concurrently using two assessment tools. Based on the study findings, there is a moderate to strong correlation (0.6) between the Teacher-made SAFI concept map and TCS. This leads us to the conclusion that SAFI concept maps are valid tools, at least, for evaluating conceptual understanding in thermodynamics. Moreover, the results of this study are confirmed a significant relationship between a student’s ability to read and comprehend a given question and his/her ability to solve it. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - As constructing concept maps from scratch can be time consuming, this study explores critiquing given concept maps with deliberate errors as an alternative. A form of concept map that distinguishes between different levels, called Knowledge Integration Map (KIM), was used as an assessment and embedded learning tool. The technology-enhanced biology unit was implemented in four high school science classes (n = 93). Student dyads in each class were randomly assigned to the KIM generation (n = 41) or critique (n = 52) task. Dyads in the generation group created their own connections from a given list of concepts, while dyads in the critique group received a concept map that included commonly found errors. KIMs in both groups consisted of the same concepts. Findings indicate that generating or critiquing KIMs can facilitate the construction of cross-level connections. Furthermore, results suggest that critiquing concept maps might be a more time-efficient alternative to generating concept maps from scratch. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the connections between the uses of concept mapping and structural equation modeling (SEM). Concept maps can also be used to help authors organize and structure reviewed literature in a manner that may help them find their voice when adding to the existing conversation on a particular topic. A discussion of the process recently utilized for a doctoral dissertation is presented to provide an example of this organizational process by presenting a summary of the literature review with a concept map of the review and the supporting documents attached to the appropriate concepts as re-sources. Dissertation examples are then used to further demonstrate how the connections between concept mapping the review of literature and using a concept map to visualize the analyses can help students demystify research methodology, especially, the use of SEM. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Inspired by the semantic network studies we propose additional conventions for choosing linking words and arrive at a Reference Set of semantically well-defined linking words drawn from the Knowledge Representation area of research in the domain of biology. Each linking word in the set is assigned a dimension: part-whole, class-inclusion, spatial-inclusion, function and attribution. We study expert representations by content analysis of biology texts at three levels of increasing subject complexity. We compare the linking words used in these representations with the Reference Set and find an increasing degree of proximity to the latter. This indicates that experts tend to use more well-defined linking words. Regarding this proximity as a characteristic of expertise, we can encourage novices to re-represent their concept maps using the linking words from the Reference Set. We discuss the implications of the approach for science education. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Users learning to concept map often confront the problem of when is it that their concept map is complete. They ask the question “Is my concept map large enough?”. As they progress in their understanding of concept maps, users often stop asking themselves whether the concept map is the appropriate size, which is key when using concept maps as means to communicate and share knowledge. In this paper we examine what factors need to be taken into account when determining the proper size for a concept map, and examine the importance of the purpose of the concept map and its intended audience. The stages through which a new Cmapper goes are also examining, and propose that to reach a Level 3 Excellent Cmapper, the question to be asked is “Is my concept map small enough?”. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to apply concept mapping to the design of an interdisciplinary approach for teaching middle school science. The study was centered around the question: What does it mean for pre-service teacher candidates to plan an integrated instructional unit using content from different science disciplines taught in middle school grades? The study required preservice teachers to (through their own understanding of science, math, and literacy content) be able to identify with an authentic real-world scenario and apply core elements to the design of an interdisciplinary approach to lesson planning, classroom instruction, and student assessment. Designing the unit involved the use of concept maps to visualize and communicate essential pedagogical elements and their relationships to each other. Analysis of pre-service teacher candidate concept maps provided a fluid basis for peer-learning, facilitated co-planning, and created a context for next level content understanding. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Concept map analysis usually focuses only on the final product. This case study used a talk aloud protocol to study the concept map construction processes of novices and experts. Three biology experts and three novices (9th/10th grade high school students) constructed a concept map from a given list of concepts. Findings suggest that final concept maps of high performing students cannot be distinguished from expert-generated maps. However, analysis of oral elaborations during the construction process revealed that experts often used the same link labels as novices but associated more complex knowledge with the label. Some final propositions would be considered incorrect without an oral explanation. Findings suggest extending concept map evaluation by complementing the final product with an analysis of intermediate stages and accompanying elaborations. Additionally, this study highlights that each expert created a different map and that there is no single best expert map. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Concept map as an effective tool allows learners to deal with an in depth analysis rather than keeping more information which is transferred through lecture based teaching. Concept map also improves the efficiency of computer assisted simulation techniques in learning environments. This research especially focuses on effectiveness of a computer simulated environment and concept mapping and its effect on conceptual understanding of science. In this study, we selected 60 high school students and divided them into two groups (30 students in Group A and 30 students in Group B). The goal of this research is to investigate how the concept maps influence the learning of Direct Current (DC) concept in electric circuits. We collected data by using Determining and Interpreting Resistive Electric Circuit Concepts Test (DIRECT). Covariance analysis indicates significant difference between two groups. Adjusted pretest scores also approve the significant effect of learning with simulation plus concept map in comparison with the sole simulation among learners (Partial eta Squared = 0.08; F = 4.84; p < 0.03). We conclude that students who used simulation along with a concept map (group B) showed better learning than students who used only a simulation software. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - As the rapid development of technology and the popularity of computer equipments, Computer aided learning makes learning effective and interesting through the use of interactive multimedia technology. In the past decade, augmented reality has become an popular technology and has widely utilized in many researches. Many researchers have integrated AR technology into multimedia instructional practices, increasing instructional flexibility and interaction. However, most of augmented reality learning system didn't have the learning scaffold or method to support learning activity, and often been designed from the perspective of developers, without considering the instructors' instructional progress and methods. Therefore, this study proposed an concept-mapping augmented reality learning system whose architecture and implementation are detailed. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, a questionnaire was given to 36 eleven years old students after their hands-on experience with the system. Results of the questionnaire showed that the proposed AR learning system support students a motivating, pleasant, and satisfying learning experience. Limitation, conclusion and future studies are given.

AB  - Concept maps are a technique used to obtain a visual representation of a person's ideas about a concept or a set of related concepts. Specifically, in this paper, through a qualitative methodology, we analyze the concept maps proposed by 52 groups of teacher training students in order to find out the characteristics of the maps and the degree of adequacy of the contents with regard to the teaching of human nutrition in the 3rd cycle of primary education. The participants were enrolled in the Teacher Training Degree majoring in Primary Education, and the data collection was carried out through a training activity under the theme of what to teach about Science in Primary School? The results show that the maps are a useful tool for working in teacher education as they allow organizing, synthesizing, and communicating what students know. Moreover, through this work, it has been possible to see that future teachers have acceptable skills for representing the concepts/ideas in a concept map, although the level of adequacy of concepts/ideas about human nutrition and its relations is usually medium or low. These results are a wake-up call for teacher training, both initial and ongoing, because they shows the inability to change priorities as far as the selection of content is concerned. © 2016, Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

AB  - This study investigates the parameters obtained through the generalizability theory which measures the topic “basic concepts related with measurement and evaluation” in the measurement and evaluation course. Data for the research were collected from 91 (49 girls 42 boys) students who are studied in the Sakarya Unıversity science education department in 2011-2012 semester. The o (student), X m (item) X h (map) were crossed in the study, and due to the fact that the item facet was random but the map facet was fix, the mixed design was used. The variances of the results obtained with filling concept maps and the percentages of explaining the total variances were researched with the G study and with the C and S techniques; and the changes in the G and Phi coefficients were researched by increasing and decreasing the item numbers with the D study. With this study, we aimed to exemplify the preferability compared to the classical test theory in having reliability of the concept map by leaning on the power, suitability and flexibility of the G theory. On the other hand, this current research is different from the generalizability studies available in literature in that it includes the mixed design sample, and therefore, it is believed to be important. © 2016, Hacettepe University, All rights reserved.

It also can support kinesthetic pedagogical practices to benefit learners with strong bodily-kinesthetic intelligence. But without proper assistance or guidance, learners' learning performance are usually disappointing. To cope with this problem, the aim of this paper proposed a concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching system in earth science course. There were 90 participants in the experiments designed with the three teaching strategies (concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching system, conventional gesture-based teaching system, and traditional e-book teaching materials). The experimental results show that the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy and traditional e-book teaching materials also improve the learning performance of the students in earth science course than conventional gesture-based teaching strategy. Learners' cognitive load was also measured and showed that the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy had lower cognitive load than conventional gesture-based teaching strategy. There was no significant difference in learning performance and cognitive load between the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy and traditional e-book teaching materials. © 2016 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research.

AB  - Concept map activities often lack a subsequent revision step that facilitates knowledge integration. This study compares two collaborative critique activities using a Knowledge Integration Map (KIM), a form of concept map. Four classes of high school biology students (n = 81) using an online inquiry-based learning unit on evolution were assigned to one of two conditions. Student dyads in one condition compared their concept maps against an expert map while dyads in the other condition conducted a peer-review. Analysis of the concept maps suggests that students in both conditions improved their understanding of evolution from pretest to posttest. However, the two conditions lead to different criteria: Students in the expert-map condition focused mostly on concept-focused criteria like concept classification while students in the peer-review condition used more link-focused criteria like link labels and missing connections. This paper suggests that both forms of KIM critique activities can be beneficial for constructing more coherent connections across different topics in evolution education. These results support the value of collaborative KIM critique activities and help clarify the forms of collaborative activities that are most likely to be effective to facilitate knowledge integration processes. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: The explication of relations between clinical and basic sciences can help vertical integration in medical curricula. Concept mapping might be a useful technique for this explication. Little is known about teachers' ability regarding the articulation of integration. We examined therefore which factors affect the learning of groups of clinicians and basic scientists on different expertise levels who learn to articulate the integration of clinical and basic sciences in concept maps. Methods: After a pilot for fine-tuning group size and instructions, seven groups of expert clinicians and basic scientists and seven groups of residents with a similar disciplinary composition constructed concept maps about a clinical problem that fit their specializations. Draft and final concepts maps were compared on elaborateness and articulated integration by means of t-tests. Participants completed a questionnaire on motivation and their evaluation of the instructions. ANOVA's were run to compare experts' and residents' views. Data from video tapes and notes were qualitatively analyzed. Finally, the three data sources were interpreted in coherence by using Pearson's correlations and qualitative interpretation. Results: Residents outshone experts as regards learning to articulate integration as comparison of the draft and final versions showed. Experts were more motivated and positive about the concept mapping procedure and instructions, but this did not correlate with the extent of integration fond in the concept maps. The groups differed as to communication: residents interacted from the start (asking each other for clarification), whereas overall experts only started interaction when they had to make joint decisions. Conclusions: Our results suggest that articulation of integration can be learned, but this learning is not related to participants' motivation or their views on the instructions. Decision making and interaction, however, do relate to the articulation of integration and this suggests that teacher learning programs for designing integrated educational programmes should incorporate co-construction tasks. Expertise level turned out to be decisive for both the level of articulation of integration, the ability to improve the articulated integration and the cooperation pattern. © 2015 Vink et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - Background: The multiple levels of knowledge related to the neurological system deter many students from pursuing studies on this topic. Thus, in facing complicated and uncertain medical circumstances, nursing students have difficulty adjusting and using basic neurological-nursing knowledge and skills. Scenario-based concept-mapping teaching has been shown to promote the integration of complicated data, clarify related concepts, and increase the effectiveness of cognitive learning. Purpose: To investigate the effect on the neurological-nursing cognition and learning attitude of nursing students of a scenario-based concept-mapping strategy that was integrated into the neurological nursing unit of a medical and surgical nursing course. Methods: This quasi-experimental study used experimental and control groups and a pre-test/post-test design. Sopho more (2nd year) students in a four-year program at a university of science and technology in Taiwan were convenience sampled using cluster randomization that was run under SPSS 17.0. Concept-mapping lessons were used as the intervention for the experimental group. The control group followed traditional lesson plans only. The cognitive learning outcome was measured using the neurological nursing-learning examination. Results: Both conceptmapping and traditional lessons significantly improved posttest neurological nursing learning scores (p &lt;.001), with no significant difference between the two groups (p =.51). The post-test feedback from the control group mentioned that too much content was taught and that difficulties were experienced in understanding mechanisms and in absorbing knowledge. In contrast, the experimental group held a significantly more positive perspective and learning attitude with regard to the teaching material. Furthermore, a significant number in the experimental group expressed the desire to add more lessons on anatomy, physiology, and pathology. These results indicate that this intervention strategy may help change the widespread fear and refusal of nursing students with regard to neurological lessons and may facilitate interest and positively affect learning in this important subject area. Conclusion: Integrating the concept-mapping strategy and traditional clinical-case lessons into neurological nursing lessons holds the potential to increase posttest scores significantly. Concept mapping helped those in the experimental group adopt views and attitudes toward learning the teaching material that were more positive than those held by their control-group peers. In addition, while 59% of the experimental group and 49% of the control group submitted opinions related to learning attitude in the open-ended questions, positive feedback was greater in the experimental group than in the control group.

AB  - A pervasive notion in the literature is that complex concept maps reflect greater knowledge and/or more expert-like thinking than less complex concept maps. We show that concept maps used to structure scientific writing and clarify scientific reasoning do not adhere to this notion. In an undergraduate course for thesis writers, students use concept maps instead of traditional outlines to define the boundaries and scope of their research and to construct an argument for the significance of their research. Students generate maps at the beginning of the semester, revise after peer review, and revise once more at the end of the semester. Although some students revised their maps to make them more complex, a significant proportion of students simplified their maps. We found no correlation between increased complexity and improved scientific reasoning and writing skills, suggesting that sometimes students simplify their understanding as they develop more expert-like thinking. These results suggest that concept maps, when used as an intervention, can meet the varying needs of a diverse population of student writers. © 2015 J. E. Dowd et al. CBE—Life Sciences Education.

AB  - The use of a companion app to augment viewing of information-rich television programmes is investigated. The app displays a synchronised graphical abstraction of a programme’s content in the form of a concept map. Two experiments were conducted involving participants watching an astronomy documentary with the app. The first compared watching the programme with and without the app, and the second compared non-interactive and interactive versions of the app. Understanding of the programme, cross-device gaze behaviour, and user experience of the app were assessed. Our results show that the companion app improved participants’ understanding and recall of the programme. Participants were found to manage their visual attention systematically when using the companion app, and correlations were found in the way they shifted their gaze from TV screen to tablet and back in response to changes in the programme content. Increasing interaction with the app disrupted understanding of the television programme and visual attention. Participants were positive about the value of companion apps for understanding and recall of programmes, but distraction and ‘knowing where to look’ were significant concerns. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.

AB  - Teaching students to use and interpret representations in science is critically important if they are to become scientifically literate and learn how to communicate their understandings and learning in science. This study involved 248 students (119 boys and 129 girls) from 26 grade 6 teachers’ classes in nine primary schools in Brisbane, Australia. Teachers were randomly allocated by school to one of three conditions: the contemporary science + representations condition (Experimentala), the contemporary condition (Experimentalb), or the comparison condition as they participated in an eight-week inquiry-science unit on Natural Disasters. Data on students’ discourse were collected at two time points during the implementation of the unit and data on the concept maps were collected pre- and post-intervention while data on the reasoning and problem-solving (RP-S) task were collected following the intervention. The results show that when students participate in an inquiry-based science unit that is augmented with a variety of multimedia resources presenting a range of current contemporary events (Experimentala and Experimentalb conditions), they demonstrate significantly more social language and basic scientific language and marked increases in moderate scientific language than their peers in the comparison condition. Interestingly, although there were no significant differences on the Personal Concept Map scores between the conditions at Times 1 and 2, the students’ scores in all conditions improved decidedly across time. It appears that as the children had more time to engage with the material, participate in cooperative peer discussions, and receive encouragement from their teachers to provide elaborated feedback to each other, their conceptual understandings of earthquakes were enhanced. However, although the children in the experimental conditions demonstrated significantly more social and scientific language than their peers in the comparison condition, these oral language skills did not transfer to the RP-S task, possibly because they may not have had enough time to consolidate their application in a novel context where they had to work independently. © 2015 University of Cambridge, Faculty of Education.

AB  - Quantitative assessment of learning is an important indicator of teaching practices apart from the depth and grasp of content being assessed. Fundamental objective of assessment approaches should help promote learner engagement and is appropriate to the diversity of learners that may be present in any class. Learning from online or virtual classrooms can be more challenging due to lack of direct personal engagement between the teacher and the student. There are various modes of assessment commonly adopted today and students may exhibit different levels of performance based on the assessment method. This paper focuses on cross-comparison of these techniques to learning of laboratory concepts in a virtual environment. Apart from comparison of the commonly used assessment methods such as multiple choice questions, descriptive questions, true/false statements etc., the work explores the best methodology to correlate assessment from a reliability and validity perspective to the learning objectives and measure the progress of individual students. Correlating the innate learning styles of students to assessment approaches is another outcome of this work. In addition, the use of concept maps to assess the relationship between various science based principles is characterized for two different experimental labs with N=147 students. The advantages to using assessment techniques from a 'time-toassess' is also elaborated in this work. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Background and purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate and identify the nature and the interrelatedness of pre-service teachers’ misconceptions and scientific concepts for explaining dissolving before, during, and after a 5E learning cycle lesson on dissolving, the intervention. Sample, design, and methods: Guided by Vygotsky’s theory of concept development, the study focused specifically on the spontaneous, and spontaneous pseudo-concepts held by the 61 elementary pre-service teachers during a 15-week science methods course. Data included concept maps, interview transcripts, written artifacts, drawings, and narratives, and were thematically analyzed to classify concepts and interrelatedness. Results: Results of the study showed that spontaneous pseudo-concepts (1) dominated pre-service teachers’ understandings about dissolving throughout the study, and (2) were simply associated with scientific concepts during and after the intervention. Conclusion: Collectively, the results indicated that the pre-service teachers’ did not acquire a unified system of knowledge about dissolving that could be characterized as abstract, generalizable, and hierarchical. Implications include the need for (1) familiarity with pre-service teachers’ prior knowledge about science content; (2) a variety of formative assessments to assess their misconceptions; (3) emphasizing the importance of dialectical method for concept development during instruction; and (4) skillful content instructors. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In secondary science education, the learning and teaching of coherent conceptual understanding are often problematic. Context-based education has been proposed as a partial solution to this problem. This study aims to gain insight into the development of conceptual coherence and how context-embedded learning-teaching activities (LT) can promote this. We describe a case study in which a context-based lesson sequence about protein-rich food production was designed and conducted in a 10th-grade biology class. The conceptual framework consisted of transformations of forms of energy and matter in photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and biosynthesis. All relevant concepts and their interconnections (propositions) were captured in a reference concept map. A research scenario was used to evaluate whether the lesson sequence was conducted as intended. Learning outcomes were determined by analyzing written products on the occurrence of propositions from the reference concept map. Additional interviews provided insight into the development of conceptual coherence in relation to three context-embedded LT activities: using graphic visualizations, writing, and concept mapping. The results indicated that students improved in mentioning propositions from the reference concept map. Propositions relating metabolic processes and including forms of energy were still difficult. Finally, successful elements of the three LT activities are considered. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc..

AB  - Experimental learning combined with theoretical learning enhances the conceptual understanding of a subject. Therefore, the Online Labs (OLabs) that hosts science experiments was developed. OLabs uses interactive simulations with theory, procedure, animations, videos, assessments and reference material. Our study blended OLabs with concept maps to examine if it enhances students' learning in Biology. Concept mapping is a framework that provides a deeper knowledge of a subject by understanding the relationships among concepts. The study was quasi-experimental; pre-test, post-test and a satisfaction survey was used as measurement instruments. The study sample was 54 students from a school in Haripad, Kerala, India. The students were randomly grouped into a control and an experimental group. The experimental group that used concept maps as a learning aid scored slightly higher, suggesting blending concept maps can lead to a deeper understanding of the subject. Gender difference did not significantly affect the scores. © 2015 ACM.

AB  - Background: Literature contends that a teacher’s knowledge of concept map-based tasks influence how their students perceive the task and execute the creation of acceptable concept maps. Teachers who are skilled concept mappers are able to (1) understand and apply the operational terms to construct a hierarchical/non-hierarchical concept map; (2) identify the legitimacy of the constructed concept map by verifying its graphical structure and its educational utility; and (3) determine the inherent ‘good’ and ‘poor’ qualities of the resulting graphical structure to reiterate the ‘good’ qualities and to coach and provide feedback to alleviate ‘poor’ qualities. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of prospective teachers’ knowledge underpinning the technique used to construct concept maps and thus, explicate their facility to construct concept maps. Sample, Design and Methods: Data consisted of 200 concept maps constructed by prospective teachers in an elementary science methods course. Results: Analysis revealed that the prospective teachers had predominantly constructed either hierarchical and/or non-hierarchical concept maps. It is likely that their maps reflect the teaching that they themselves would have experienced in their science classrooms during their own education. Additionally, most of these concepts maps only contained the root concept and subordinate concepts and lacked directional linking lines, linking phrases, labelled lines and propositions. Conclusions: We argue that teacher educators need to assess their prospective teachers’ understanding of concept mapping in relation to the legitimacy (the nature and quality) of the end-products (graphical structures) of such practices. Prospective teachers also need to understand the educational utility of concept mapping in terms of how these end-products impact and/or effectuate learning. © 2015 NFER.

AB  - Recent school science curriculum developments in many countries emphasise that scientists derive evidence for their claims through different approaches; that such practices are bound up with disciplinary knowledge; and that the quality of data should be appreciated. This position paper presents an understanding of the validity of data as a set of conceptual relationships, illustrating the application of the network of ideas and their inter-relationships necessary for the ‘thinking behind the doing’ with examples from practice. We explore ways in which this understanding of data is inherently related to underpinning disciplinary ideas. We suggest how the recognition of a conceptual basis for understanding the quality of data represents an ontological shift with respect to widespread characterisations of scientific practices which addresses some long-standing issues in science education research, policy, curricula and practice. © 2015 British Educational Research Association.

AB  - Concept mapping is a pedagogical technique that was developed in the 1970s and is being used in K–12 and postsecondary education. Although it has shown excellent results in other fields, it is still rare in political science. In this research note, I discuss the implementation and testing of concept mapping in my Advanced Introduction to International Relations course. I find that student self-reporting indicates that this approach has a positive impact on student comprehension of texts and learning in the course. I suggest improvements that I intend to implement with the technique, as well as a future research agenda. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate experienced science teachers’ perceptions regard integrating literacy and technology while teaching science at an elementary level. A concept map and rubric were developed based on the TPACK model to assess teachers' understanding and an in-depth interview technique was used to collect more data from the teachers. For the analysis, the concept map was graded based on the rubric and in-depth interviews were thematically analyzed. The data indicated that teachers have a negative perception about integrating technology and literacy in their classes, due to several barriers. This paper concludes with recommendations to facilitate the use of technology and literacy when teaching science in the elementary schools in Kuwait. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

AB  - When entering the classroom, adolescents already hold various conceptions on science topics. Concept maps may function as useful tools to reveal such conceptions although labor-intensive analysis often prevents application in typical classroom situations. The authors aimed to provide teachers with an appropriate approach to analyze students concept maps within daily school routine. They intended to conclude qualitative changes from analyzing quantitative parameters. To test the approach, high school students were asked to map their conceptions before and after attending an educational program on climate change. For the analyses, quantitative as well as qualitative methods were applied. A comparison of pre- and postmaps pointed to a conceptual change. From strong correlations between qualitative and quantitative parameters we assumed our approach to be applicable. Due to its simple and barely time-consuming handling, the authors approach is suitable for application in conventional classroom situations and may contribute to inform teachers about students conceptions. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study explored the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and its development of four experienced biology teachers in the context of teaching school genetics. PCK was defined in terms of teacher content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and knowledge of students’ preconceptions and learning difficulties. Data sources of teacher knowledge base included teacher-constructed concept maps, pre- and post-lesson teacher interviews, video-recorded genetics lessons, post-lesson teacher questionnaire and document analysis of teacher's reflective journals and students’ work samples. The results showed that the teachers’ individual PCK profiles consisted predominantly of declarative and procedural content knowledge in teaching basic genetics concepts. Conditional knowledge, which is a type of meta-knowledge for blending together declarative and procedural knowledge, was also demonstrated by some teachers. Furthermore, the teachers used topic-specific instructional strategies such as context-based teaching, illustrations, peer teaching, and analogies in diverse forms but failed to use physical models and individual or group student experimental activities to assist students’ internalization of the concepts. The finding that all four teachers lacked knowledge of students’ genetics-related preconceptions was equally significant. Formal university education, school context, journal reflection and professional development programmes were considered as contributing to the teachers’ continuing PCK development. Implications of the findings for biology teacher education are briefly discussed. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The goal of care mapping in the clinical setting in undergraduate nursing education is to determine the student's ability to collect, present, and connect relevant data points in order to evaluate and understand the medical plan of care and to develop a priority based nursing plan of care. This same process can be utilized across all health science education programs. The purpose of this chapter is to share how the author has modified the traditional concept map tool to a more user friendly format and to present a process of implementation that may be used in the clinical setting as part of any undergraduate health science program. The benefits of such an implementation are that of more enriched learning to include the development of critical thinking skills, the use of a common sense approach, and the recognition of the patient as a holistic being. © 2015, IGI Global.

AB  - Biomechanics education is a vital component of kinesiology, sports medicine, and physical education, as well as for many biomedical engineering and bioengineering undergraduate programmes. Little research exists regarding effective teaching strategies for biomechanics. However, prior work suggests that student learning in undergraduate physics courses has been aided by using the Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT). As physics understanding plays a role in biomechanics understanding, the purpose of study was to evaluate the use of a JiTT framework in an undergraduate biomechanics course. This two-year action-based research study evaluated three JiTT frameworks: (1) no JiTT; (2) mathematics-based JiTT; and (3) concept-based JiTT. A pre- and post-course assessment of student learning used the biomechanics concept inventory and a biomechanics concept map. A general linear model assessed differences between the course assessments by JiTT framework in order to evaluate learning and teaching effectiveness. The results indicated significantly higher learning gains and better conceptual understanding in a concept-based JiTT course, relative to a mathematics-based JiTT or no JiTT course structure. These results suggest that a course structure involving concept-based questions using a JiTT strategy may be an effective method for engaging undergraduate students and promoting learning in biomechanics courses. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

In experimental group 1 courses were conducted through technology supported mind mapping activities, while courses in experimental group 2 were conducted through technology supported concept mapping activities. The courses in the control group were conducted through activities in the science and technology curriculum. The results revealed that the students in experimental group 1 had a higher level of understanding concepts than the other groups. Students in experimental group 1 stated that it was fun and instructive to prepare mind maps; students in experimental group 2 stated that the concept maps were fun and instructive. © Kamla-Raj 2015.

AB  - Medical school education has traditionally been driven by single discipline teaching and assessment. Newer medical school curricula often implement an organ-based approach that fosters integration of basic science and clinical disciplines. Concept maps are widely used in education. Through diagrammatic depiction of a variety of concepts and their specific connections with other ideas, concept maps provide a unique perspective into learning and performance that can complement other assessment methods commonly used in medical schools. In this innovation, we describe using concepts maps as a vehicle for a modified a classic Team-Based Learning (TBL) exercise. Modifications to traditional TBL in our innovation included replacing an individual assessment using multiple-choice questions with concept maps as well as combining the group assessment and application exercise whereby teams created concept maps. These modifications were made to further assess understanding of content across the Fundamentals module (the introductory module of the preclerkship curriculum). While preliminary, student performance and feedback from faculty and students support the use of concept maps in TBL. Our findings suggest concept maps can provide a unique means of determining assessment of learning and generating feedback to students. Concept maps can also demonstrate knowledge acquisition, organization of prior and new knowledge, and synthesis of that knowledge across disciplines in a unique way providing an additional means of assessment in addition to traditional multiple-choice questions. © Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S. All rights reserved.

AB  - The basic premise underlying this research is that scientific phenomena are best learned by creating an external representation that complies with the complex and dynamic nature of such phenomena. Effective representations are assumed to incorporate three key characteristics: they are graphical, dynamic, and provide a pre-specified outline of the domain. This study examined the impact of these characteristics on performance and learning. High school students first read an instructional text about glucose–insulin regulation and then created a representation of its content. Representations differed regarding the key characteristics such that the summary (n = 15), concept map (n = 16), model (n = 23), and outlined model (n = 21) all incorporated one additional characteristic compared to their precursor. Main results indicated learning effects in each of these four conditions. Furthermore, creating a model was found to enhance students’ learning more than creating a concept map, and students who completed an outlined model were found to learn more than those who created a model from scratch. In conclusion, this study does not univocally verify the necessity of all key characteristics individually, but the results do show that a representational format that combines all key characteristics enhances learning more than other formats. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - While the utility of concept mapping has been widely reported in primary and secondary educational contexts, its application in the health sciences in higher education has been less frequently noted. Two case studies of the application of concept mapping in undergraduate and postgraduate health sciences are detailed in this paper. The case in undergraduate dental education examines the role of concept mapping in supporting problem-based learning and explores how explicit induction into the principles and practices of CM has add-on benefits to learning in an inquiry-based curriculum. The case in postgraduate medical education describes the utility of concept mapping in an online inquiry-based module design. Specific attention is given to applications of CMapTools™ software to support the implementation of Novakian concept mapping in both inquiry-based curricular contexts.

AB  - We present research carried out with university students taking the subject "Concept Maps in Teaching" within the Master's Degree on Research in Teaching and Learning of the Experimental Sciences. The objective of this study was to elaborate a reasoning model, created using concept maps, that captures modes of thinking of expert teachers about solving kinematics problems. This model, used as a framework for those with less expertise in a particular form of argumentation, identifies approaches to solving certain types of problems. This paper focuses on the creation, utilisation, and validation of a reasoning model for solving kinematics problems. This model may apply to other types of learning content (concepts, procedures, but primarily arguments). The study was conducted during a school year with 60 students using a pre-test and post-test method to quantify the effectiveness of the reasoning model developed in problem solving. The statistical analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the performance of the experimental and control groups. The results suggest that the development and use of this type of metareasoning, which is necessary for building a reasoning model, are of great help in teaching our students to reason about kinematics problem solving.

AB  - The Aquarius satellite mission and Salinity Processes in the Upper-ocean Regional Study (SPURS) are providing the scientific community with new insights into the role seawater salinity plays in the Earth system. Aquarius and SPURS scientists and engineers, working with the University of Maine-based Salinity Public Engagement and Communications team, developed webinars that focused on how these programs’ findings increase knowledge about topics such as the water cycle, ocean circulation, and climate. Direct involvement of research scientists and engineers was key to the success of these efforts. These experts learned how to use interactive concept maps to “deconstruct” scientific content into simpler graphical formats for their presentations. A benefit to webinar participants, presenters, and facilitators was that they honed their critical thinking skills. In addition, the webinars allow people traditionally not represented in science, technology, engineering and math to gain better access to high-quality NASA materials. Post-event audience evaluation data provide valuable feedback on the impacts of sharing the results of ocean salinity research beyond the scientific community. © 2015 by The Oceanography Society.

AB  - Concept maps have been extensively used in education, especially in science teaching. There is strong evidence that their use is associated with increased knowledge transfer and retention across several instructional conditions, settings and methodological features. However, constructing a concept map is complex and difficult for students, especially newbies. Consequently, there is a necessity to provide feedback to the learners during the authoring of their concept maps. There are several concept-mapping tools that provide feedback but none of them provide immediate or just-in-time (JIT) feedback. This kind of feedback is important for two reasons: First, low achieving or low mastery students benefit greatly from this type of feedback. Second, when students start out badly, with incorrect propositions, they tend to continue with further incorrect propositions until the map is grossly incorrect and JIT feedback could prevent this situation. This paper presents a practical application of Ohlsson's theory of learning from performance errors to provide JIT feedback during the construction of concept maps. It is shown that by creating an Entity-Relationship (E-R) schema that incorporates additional elements into the standard schema for concept maps, the schema can be implemented with Datalog, benefiting from the use of its deductive features to provide immediate feedback to the learner. Finally, some field related examples are provided. ©2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Concept maps have been used to help students with learning disabilities (LD) improve literacy skills and content learning, predominantly in secondary school. However, despite increased access to classroom technology, no previous studies have examined the efficacy of computer-based concept maps to improve learning from informational text for students with LD in elementary school. In this study, we used a concurrent delayed multiple probe design to evaluate the interactive use of computer-based concept maps on content acquisition with science and social studies texts for Hispanic students with LD in Grades 4 and 5. Findings from this study suggest that students improved content knowledge during intervention relative to a traditional instruction baseline condition. Learning outcomes and social validity information are considered to inform recommendations for future research and the feasibility of classroom implementation. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Companion apps for television programmes provide additional, synchronized and interactive content on mobile devices such as tablets or smartphones. With the television screen they create dual screen interfaces with multiple modalities and require viewers to actively manage their visual attention. We outline a model of interactions with companion apps used with information-rich television programmes where a primary purpose of the app is to support understanding and learning. Our model summarises perceptual and cognitive processes involved by drawing on theories and findings from Human Factors and the learning sciences. We use the model to assess CompanionMap, an app for accompanying science documentaries with synchronized, animated concept maps. We show how the model provides explanations for four findings obtained from an experiment with CompanionMap, including how users managed their visual attention and how they learnt about astrophysics when using the app to watch an astronomy programme.

AB  - Despite many efforts from both industry and academia to prepare students for professional practice, the disconnect between what industry would like students to know and the quality and adequacy of the skills with which students graduate still remains. In an attempt to address this disparity, a flipped classroom approach and a strong liaison with an industry partner have been implemented in two consecutive second year Information Systems courses since 2013. A design science methodology, implemented through a theory of coherent practice, was used to guide the design of the curriculum for this approach. As part of the evaluation of this approach, each course was executed as an action experiment. A set of carefully designed interventions to foster an interactive and integrated pedagogy, where students actively participated in their own learning, constituted the elements of these experiments. Interventions, such as quizzes, exercises, discussions, polls, projects and more, were structured to ensure that students experience the three learning stages of knowing, understanding and applying. It was a dynamic and ongoing process of fusing practical experience with theoretical concepts. It further helped to determine what level of competency students have reached and guided their growth to the next level through enhanced skills, experience and deep approaches to learning as well as through changes in attitude. An additional advantage was that students already started to prepare for their careers during the early stages of their studies. The paper will report on the outcomes of the four specific action experiments and the rationale behind their design. Concept maps were used to evaluate the feedback from these experiments, illustrating the benefits and the limitations in each one of the three learning phases. The reflections on and lessons learnt from each action experiment helped to conceptualise new interventions and adapt existing ones. The nature of the involvement of the industry partner will also be highlighted and further improvements will be proposed.

AB  - In the last decennium learning outcomes became a key factor in quality assurance in higher education in Europe causing an increased interest in methodologies for specifying learning outcomes of a study programme. At the Faculty of Engineering Science, KU Leuven, the ACQA (Academic Competence and Quality Assurance) framework [1] was adopted and implemented. Competence profiles based on ACQA criteria were compiled for all engineering programmes and actively used in accreditation procedures, quality assurance and curriculum development [2]. Despite the proven value of the use of learning outcomes and competence profiles in curriculum development, education developers at the Faculty of Engineering Science felt a need for additional tools to analyse the curriculum with the feeling of ownership as an important additional scope. The use of concepts to analyse the curriculum felt to be very approachable and open to large groups of lecturers. In general, concept mapping is a visual representation of ideas designed to illustrate the relationships between ideas. Previous experiences with concept mapping as a tool for course design proved to be inspiring to elaborate these principles to a curriculum level. In this paper, we will describe the use of concepts and concept mapping as an innovative tool for curriculum development. The use of diverse formats of concept mapping at the Faculty of Engineering Science will be described and discussed in the context of qualitative support in curriculum development.

AB  - As an interdisciplinary team of educational researchers we explored pre-service science teachers' perspectives on using digital technologies and social media to address socially relevant issues in science teaching. The rationale for teaching socially relevant science was embedded in the concept of renaiscience, thus underscoring the need for science to be perceived as a human activity. We drew on generational theory to consider the educational significance of digital technologies and social media. Two diffierent activities were used to elicit the pre-service science teachers' perspectives. First, we invited them to reflect on a digital animation that we had produced, and they highlighted the advantages of digital animation as a medium to communicate a socially relevant message more appealingly to the Millennial generation. We then engaged these pre-service teachers in a structured concept-mapping activity to consider how digital technologies and social media might be used to address social challenges in South Africa. They drew our attention to the affordances of digital technologies and social media as a means to facilitate critical thinking, cater for diverse learning styles, and make high-quality scientific knowledge more accessible. They highlighted that teaching socially relevant science using digital resources can be cheap, convenient, collaborative, and creative. © 2015 University of the Free State.

AB  - Question answering (QA) is the automated process of answering general questions submitted by humans in natural language. QA has previously been explored within the educational context to facilitate learning, however the majority of works have focused on text-based answering. As an alternative, this paper proposes an approach to return answers as a concept map, which further encourages meaningful learning and knowledge organisation. Additionally, this paper investigates whether adapting the returned concept map to the specific question context provides further learning benefit. A randomised experiment was conducted with a sample of 59 Computer Science undergraduates, obtaining statistically significant results on learning gain when students are provided with the question-specific concept maps. Further, time spent on studying the concept maps were positively correlated with the learning gain. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine relationships among pre-service science teachers' conceptual knowledge of electric current, motivational beliefs, and self-regulation. One hundred and twenty-seven students (female = 107, male = 20) enrolled in the science education program of a public university in Ankara participated the study. A concept map technique was used to determine students' conceptual knowledge level of electric current. To determine students' motivational beliefs and self-regulation, a scale developed by Velayutham, Aldridge, and Fraser (2011) was first translated into Turkish and adapted to Turkish culture and then used as a measurement tool. Results showed that students' motivational beliefs were positively associated with their self-regulation, and students' task value, self-efficacy, and self-regulation were positively related with students' conceptual knowledge of electric current. These results show that students' motivational beliefs and self-regulation have important roles in students' conceptual knowledge level when assessed using concept map technique. © 2015 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research.

AB  - Traditional instructional materials such as textbooks contain significant educational content, but thenavigational mechanisms to access that content are limited and, more importantly, not designed with learning in mind. To address this gap, we present the Adaptive Map, a novel organization and navigation tool designed to help students better understand large collections of information such as those found in textbooks. The tool promotes conceptual understanding by leveraging expert-generated concept maps, which have been shown to improve learning. In addition, to alleviate problems associated with visually processing large-scale concept maps, our design integrated information visualization techniques to increase usability and facilitate processing. To evaluate the approach, a prototype was developed and tested in an engineering statics class. A multiple case study methodology was used to explore how students used the tool. Results show that the tool promoted conceptual understanding by facilitating advance organizer usage and students' exploration of relevant prior content.

AB  - Concept Maps are graphic representations of topics, ideas, and their relationships. They allow users to group information in related modules so that the connections between the modules become more readily apparent. Among the potential uses of concept mapping for the improvement of learning and teaching in classrooms, the powerful technique of concept mapping could improve education in four different categories: (1) as a planned learning strategy, (2) as an instructional strategy, (3) as a strategy for planning curriculum, and (4) as a means of assessing students understanding of science concepts. Concept Maps are essential to increase meaningful learning in students and for representing the knowledge, experience of individuals and teams in education, science, medical and management course. In this paper we have made exhaustive survey to bind up various research works carried on concept maps in the above mentioned disciplines and have simplified the things for beginners to carry out research on concept mapping. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - During the last two decades it has been observed that there has been substantial advancement in the domain of E-Learning systems. This may be attributed to development in the field on networking and communication. However most of these systems lack face to face interaction between the learner and the tutor and hence are unable to pinpoint the learner deficiencies. In this context, several researchers have used Concept Maps for identifying student learning barriers. However a major drawback of Concept Map approach is that all concepts are given equal degree of importance from the learner point of view. In this work a Weighted Concept Map based approach is proposed to provide remedial learning guidance to the learners. The system works by generating automated Concept Map and assigning weights to the concepts based on their importance for computation of best remedial learning path. The approach has been tested with a set of middle school students for identifying their learning deficiencies in science courses and the results found to be satisfactory. © Springer India 2015.

AB  - In this paper we describe the architecture of an e-learning environment that blends concept maps with Online Labs (OLabs) to enhance student performance in biology. In the Indian context, a secondary school student’s conceptual understanding of hard topics in biology is at risk because of a lack of qualified teachers and necessary equipments in labs to conduct experiments. Concept map provides a visual framework which allows students to get an overview of a concept, its various sub concepts and their relationships and linkages. OLabs with its animations, videos and simulations is an interactive, immersive approach for practicing science experiments. The blended e-learning environment was tested by systematically developing a concept map for the concept “Photosynthesis” and by successfully integrating it into the OLabs environment. Our blended approach to concept understanding has interesting implications for the teacher who is engaged in training programs. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

In recent years, several methods have been presented to automatically construct concept map that achieved encouraging results, while ignoring some critical issues when applied in actual E-learning system. In this paper, we propose a practical approach for constructing concept map, which is adapted to the dynamic character of a real system. Moreover, we apply fuzzy set theory and fuzzy reasoning basis on fuzzy rules for similarity degree between two concepts, to find direct prerequisite relationship among concepts. It provides a useful way to improve accuracy and reduce complexity of the concept map. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The Go-Lab federation of online labs opens up virtual laboratories (simulation), remote laboratories (real equipment accessible at distance) and data sets from physical laboratory experiments (together called “online labs”) for large-scale use in education. In this way, Go-Lab enables inquiry-based learning that promotes acquisition of deep conceptual domain knowledge and inquiry skills, with the further intent of interesting students in careers in science. For students, Go-Lab offers the opportunity to perform scientific experiments with online labs in pedagogically structured learning spaces. Go-Lab’s inquiry learning spaces (ILSs) structure the students’ inquiry process through an inquiry cycle and provide students with guidance in which dedicated (and connected) scaffolds for inquiry processes play a pivotal role. Teachers can create and adapt inquiry learning phases and the associated guidance in an ILS through a simple wiki-like interface and can add scaffolds and tools to an ILS using a straightforward drag and drop feature. Teachers can also adapt scaffolds and tools (e.g., change the language or the concepts available in a concept mapper) through an “app composer”. In creating ILSs, teachers are supported by scenarios and associated defaults ILSs that can be used as a starting point for development. In addition, teachers are offered a community framework to disseminate best practices and find mutual support. For lab-owners, Go-Lab provides open interfacing solutions for easily plugging in their online labs and sharing them in the Go-Lab federation of online labs. In its first year, Go-Lab created ILSs for thirteen online labs from different lab providers, including renowned research organizations (e.g., CERN, ESA) that participate in the consortium. The design of these inquiry learning spaces has been evaluated through mock-ups and prototypes with students and teachers. More advanced and later versions will be evaluated and validated in large scale pilots. The sustainability of Go-Lab will come from the opportunity for the larger science education community to add new online labs and share ILSs. An open and Web-based community will capitalize on the “collective intelligence” of students, teachers, and scientists. © 2014, de Jong et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - The value of collaborative concept mapping in assisting students to develop an understanding of complex concepts across a broad range of basic and applied science subjects is well documented. Less is known about students' learning processes that occur during the construction of a concept map, especially in the context of clinical cases in veterinary medicine. This study investigated the unfolding collaborative learning processes that took place in real-time concept mapping of a clinical case by veterinary medical students and explored students' and their teacher's reflections on the value of this activity. This study had two parts. The first part investigated the cognitive and metacognitive learning processes of two groups of students who displayed divergent learning outcomes in a concept mapping task. Meaningful group differences were found in their level of learning engagement in terms of the extent to which they spent time understanding and co-constructing knowledge along with completing the task at hand. The second part explored students' and their teacher's views on the value of concept mapping as a learning and teaching tool. The students' and their teacher's perceptions revealed congruent and contrasting notions about the usefulness of concept mapping. The relevance of concept mapping to clinical case-based learning in veterinary medicine is discussed, along with directions for future research. © 2014 AAVMC.

AB  - This study investigated the conceptions of 340 Taiwanese high school students (grades 10 to 12) regarding oxidation–reduction reactions. The diagnostic tool used was a two-tier test based on a concept map of redox reactions as presented in high school curriculums. The reliability of the two-tier test items was 0.82. The results show that most 11th graders performed equally well in questions related to the concept of the gain and loss of electrons during oxidation–reduction. In terms of working with oxidation numbers, scores increased with grade level. The results of this study provide valuable reference for curriculum designers and science instructors. © 2014(Publisher Name). All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Conceptual acquisition is an important aspect of science education, especially with regard to committing things to long term memory. Three case studies were carried out to examine approaches to conceptual acquisition in science education. The aim of these studies was to determine whether concept mapping method is a valid research method. To answer the question, studies were developed. Two of them used animation to describe abstract topics in chemistry. The aim of the third study was to compare the diferences in higher taxonomy concept maps, created in an allocated timeframe. The fndings of the studies indicate that the use of voiced interactive animation without teacher explanation does not lend itself to superior concept acquisition. As a result of the study it was concluded that concept mapping as an assessment method provides a unique possibility to visualize the structure of students’ conceptual achievements. Based on the outcomes it is recommended concept mapping should be used more as an assessment or research method. © 2014(Publisher Name). All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an experiment regarding the effects of using one of two different programming environments in secondary schools. Both "Scratch" and "Karel the Robot" have been successfully used in these settings previously. These two environments are also representative for two classes of programming environments for beginners. One is more graphically oriented and may therefore alleviate the steep learning curve of programming while the other is text-based and therefore more akin to"real"programming. Also, one places more emphasis on the visualization of program structure and the other emphasizes visualizing program ow. The experiment has been conducted in parallel in two school classes, each using one of the two approaches. The abilities of the students were tested before and after the experiment as well as their intrinsic motivation and the perceived self-regulation. The results show, that the class using Scratch has higher intrinsic motivation and performs better, however the Karel class shows a higher identified regulation. © 2014 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Over the past two decades, science educators increasingly have become interested in the role of language in the learning of science and have drawn on the work of Bakhtin, among others, for understanding the dialogical nature of knowledge in a sociocultural framework. However, the nature of language and its relation to thinking have not substantially changed and, in many ways, are incommensurable with the cultural-historical, materialist dialectical underpinning of the original framing of the sociocultural and dialogical approaches in the theories of L. S. Vygotsky and M. M. Bakhtin and his circle (e.g., V. N. Vološinov). Most importantly, currently available analyses of science classroom talk do not appear to exhibit sufficient appreciation of the fact that words, statements, and language are living phenomena, that is, they inherently change in speaking. In this paper, I begin by working out the premise that language is a living phenomenon that changes in use. I then present two key insights on language-in-use that derive from the works of Vygotsky and the Bakhtin circle, which are used to develop a theoretical and methodological frame. These key insights and the theoretical aspects of this paper are exemplified with materials from a concept mapping session in a 12th-grade physics course. The proposed model has considerable implications for theorizing the relation between classroom talk and formal written genres of expression, and gives rise to many newresearch questions. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - As work is an inherently cooperative phenomenon, it requires a common understanding of the nature of collaboration for all involved parties. In this way, explicit articulation work becomes an integral and essential part of collaboration. Implicit aspects of collaboration have impact on the quality of work results, mainly through social norms and observations of working together. Eliciting those aspects interactively helps in avoiding (mutual) misrepresentations and lack of understanding. Tangible articulation support systems allow aligning mental models of how work should be carried out. Stakeholders can develop a common understanding of collaboration in a semantically open and non-intrusive way. They are not burdened by explication features and diagrammatic notations. We have utilised experiences with model-centred learning theory to support explicit articulation work. According to our field studies, the resulting models can be fed back to current work practices and help in preventing problematic work situations. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Environmental education in the 21st century requires well-instructed teachers with teaching and communication abilities. This paper presents an educational experience developed in several biology and environmental teacher training courses and focused on the treatment of environmental education as a transversal educational topic. For that aim, text analysis techniques, concept mapping and informatics tools have been used to represent individual and collaborative knowledge about environmental topics. 69 students participated in the research. Data about the educational activities developed by the participants have been collected. Furthermore, students have expressed their opinions on the formative process by means of an opinion survey. The outcomes of this study reveal that future teachers and environmental educators consider that concept mapping is a valuable tool to represent their knowledge about environmental education, to encourage reflexive and collaborative learning, to improve teaching communicative abilities and to use effectively ICT in the classroom.

AB  - To support effective science teaching, educators need methods to reveal student understandings and misconceptions of science concepts and to offer all students an opportunity to reflect on their own knowledge construction and organization. Students can benefit by engaging in scientific activities in which they build personal connections between what they learn and their own experiences. Integrating studentconstructed concept mapping into the science curriculum can reveal to both students and teachers the conceptual organization and understanding of science content, which can assist in building connections between concepts and personal experiences. This chapter describes how a class of third grade students used concept maps to understand science concepts (specifically, "watershed systems"). During class discussions and interviews, students revised concept map content and structure as their ideas developed. The study's results demonstrate how students' critical thinking (self-reflection and revision) was supported as misconceptions were revealed through their construction of concept maps over time. © 2014, IGI Global.

AB  - Helping students learn the basic sciences and demonstrating their importance in the practice of medicine presents a challenge for the majority of medical science educators. A curriculum change of medical biochemistry was implemented to include concept mapping as a visual strategy to enhance the analytical and critical thinking skills during clinical case-based workshops. A rubric was used to give detailed feedback and provide guidance to students. A number of clinical cases were judiciously selected to illustrate specific topics. Students meet with a faculty member to discuss the concept map prior to the workshop. During such meetings, all members are asked to participate in explaining their reasoning and decisionmaking and to thereby justify the flow of the concept map. This activity gives students the opportunity to demonstrate their capacity to visualize their knowledge using the concept map construction. © 2014, IGI Global.

AB  - Funded by the Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (COSEE) program of the National Science Foundation (NSF), COSEE-Ocean Systems (OS) has employed concept mapping to facilitate collaboration and communication between ocean scientists and educators. Based on iterative feedback from and interaction with its participants, COSEE-OS has developed online concept mapping software linked to an ever-growing database with thousands of scientist-vetted resources, known as the Concept Linked Integrated Media Builder (CLIMB; cosee.umaine. edu/climb). Concomitant with the evolution of its CLIMB software functionality, COSEE-OS has transitioned from exclusively holding in-person concept mapping workshops to predominantly preparing for and delivering concept map-based webinar events, featuring ocean science researchers. This transition to webinars has greatly increased the number of participants and expanded the geographic reach from local to global. This chapter focuses on three key areas in which COSEE-OS has supported critical thinking: (1) the collaborative process of making meaningful learning by creating, analyzing, and improving concept maps with others; (2) facilitating subject-matter experts in the formulation of concept map-based presentations, which audiences can use to evaluate the validity of their connections and conclusions; and (3) the training of scientists to use concept mapping as a technique to more clearly delineate and explain how their research is tied to societally relevant issues. Three case descriptions on how COSEE-OS concept mapping facilitation and infrastructure have been applied to ocean sciences education efforts-both within the COSEE Network and beyond to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-are also presented. © 2014, IGI Global.

AB  - Environmental, economic, and social trends suggest the need for more sustainable ways of thinking and patterns of behaviour. Such a shift would require humanity to function at high levels of ecological literacy, which relies on a certain amount of scientific literacy. However, troubling evidence indicates an international pattern of student disengagement with science at the secondary level. Evidence also suggests that it is difficult to integrate environmental or sustainability education at this level, both within New Zealand and elsewhere. This research was aimed at examining the use of a novel approach, using permaculture, in junior secondary science (Years 9 and 10) to enhance students’ ecological and scientific literacy, as well as their attitudes toward studying science in school. Permaculture is an ecological design system based on science and ethics. A permaculture approach to science education involves eco-design thinking, as well as the use of local permaculture properties and practitioners, and the science behind common permaculture practices. The approach is also meant to be relevant and engaging, and to promote systems thinking. This study involved the design and delivery of an intervention based on permaculture principles to one Year 10 science class in New Zealand. Research took the form of a naturalistic, interpretive, mixed methods case study, which included the use of questionnaires, interviews, and observations. Data collection focused on the impacts of a permaculture approach on the teaching and learning of science, on students’ ecological literacy, and on students’ attitudes toward learning science in school. Pre- and post-intervention questionnaires probed students’ opinions on the environment, science, and learning science in school, and tested their sustainable thinking and systems thinking with concept mapping and SOLO Taxonomy exercises. Classroom observations took place over the course of 12 weeks, on average 3 days per week, totalling 31 days. Before and after some classroom visits, I had informal conversations with the teacher, along with three formal interviews before, during and after the intervention. Three focus groups of students were interviewed immediately following the intervention. Findings show that a permaculture approach to junior secondary science can impact positively on students’ understanding of science and sustainability, and may impact on their attitudes toward studying science in school. It also appeared to impact positively on the science teacher's attitude toward including sustainability in his teaching practice, and on his own sustainability learning. Regarding both students and teachers, a permaculture approach appears to have been effective to cultivate attitudes and trellis learning. The teacher and the students responded favourably to many aspects of the intervention, including the overall focus on the environment, the field trips, and some classroom learning activities. The teacher reported appreciating the way the intervention contextualised science with real world examples. Most students reported appreciating the experiential aspects of the intervention, as well as the relevance that a permaculture approach to science education provided. Findings indicate that advances in ecological and scientific literacy varied among students. Some students appeared to: improve their use of science and sustainability vocabulary; become more aware of select socio-scientific issues; better recognise scientific and ecological limits and possibilities. Some students also showed advances in sustainable thinking and systems thinking. Although many students expressed concern about issues such as pollution, wildlife, and genetic engineering’” and prioritised protecting the environment over making money’” there appeared to be a disconnect between these feelings and a sense of personal responsibility to act. Most students reported enjoying learning science with a focus on the environment, with one cohort indicating much greater enjoyment of the permaculture approach than their usual level of enjoyment of learning science in school. Trends in environmental degradation, population growth, energy inflation, and economic stagnation’” especially pronounced since the beginning of this inquiry in 2008’” indicate that the world of the future will require ecologically literate citizens who can design and create truly sustainable systems for all human endeavors. Cultivating such citizens, and trellising their science and sustainability learning has implications for science education. This thesis identifies an innovative approach for junior secondary science in New Zealand that provides a way towards a more sustainable future. © 2014, The Authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work contrasts Giovanni Sartor's view of inferential semantics of legal concepts (Sartor in Artif Intell Law 17:217-251, 2009) with a probabilistic model of theory formation (Kemp et al. in Cognition 114:165-196, 2010). The work further explores possibilities of implementing Kemp's probabilistic model of theory formation in the context of mapping legal concepts between two individual legal systems. For implementing the legal concept mapping, we propose a cross-categorization approach that combines three mathematical models: the Bayesian Model of Generalization (BMG; Tenenbaum and Griffiths in Behav Brain Sci 4:629-640, 2001), the probabilistic model of theory formation, i.e., the Infinite Relational Model (IRM) first introduced by Kemp et al. (The twenty-first national conference on artificial intelligence, 2006, Cognition 114:165-196, 2010) and its extended model, i.e., the normal-IRM (n-IRM) proposed by Herlau et al. (IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing, 2012). We apply our cross-categorization approach to datasets where legal concepts related to educational systems are respectively defined by the Japanese- and the Danish authorities according to the International Standard Classification of Education. The main contribution of this work is the proposal of a conceptual framework of the cross-categorization approach that, inspired by Sartor (Artif Intell Law 17:217-251, 2009), attempts to explain reasoner's inferential mechanisms. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This paper presents a study on the role of the teacher in computer-supported class group activities. We discuss various teacher tools that support this role. In the reported studies the students are engaged in group activities through networked computers. Typically they use a two-space collaboration tool. One shared space used for jointly producing a diagrammatic representation (concept map or other form of diagram), and one for text based communication. The group activities have a time span of typical classes: i.e. a few minutes to a few hours. In this context, we focus on the study of typical teacher actions and used representations and on the support that the tools used provided to the teacher for supervision of the class and group activities. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Curriculum units, based on an Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM), were developed for high-ability learners, but tried out with all students in Title I settings to study the efficacy of the units with all learners. The units focus on the development of students’ conceptual understanding to undergird science content attainment. Teaching and learning models, such as concept formation and concept mapping were used to scaffold science learning and reasoning for appropriate curriculum differentiation. Science content mastery was measured using the Metropolitan Achievement Tests. Reasoning skills were measured using the Test of Critical Thinking. Understanding of macro-concepts and content attainment were measured by curriculum-embedded performance-based assessments. Students with the ICM outperformed students without the specialized curriculum in science content and reasoning skills, and showed greater growth in both conceptual understanding and content attainment. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - In this paper we present a descriptive research that shows the relationships between conceptual knowledge structure, working memory, academic level and science text comprehension. High school students (10th and 12th grade students) have participated in this research. Students’ working memory capacity was measured by means of the Daneman and Carpenter’s test. Next, the students read a science text, and starting from the textual information, they constructed a concept map. Finally, they carried out a reading comprehension test. Results indicate that: a) the academic level produces significant differences in working memory, concept map, and reading comprehension tests scores; b) high and significant correlations have been found between the scores of these last three tests; c) concept map and memory working tests scores are significant predictors of reading comprehension test scores. © 2014 Universidad Autonoma de Madrid.

AB  - Sustainability is fast becoming a, if not the, central research issue of our time. The inexorable press of climate change, population growth and resource consumption highlights the need to produce knowledge that enables us to act with our future in mind. Transdisciplinary sustainability science (TDSS) has emerged in response to this need. TDSS is driven by complex sustainability problems, such as siting of waste facilities or formulation of climate adaptation policies, that require input from many disciplines, professions and communities (Spangenberg 2011), thereby motivating the democratization of science and new forms of engagement (Carolan 2006). Many of the problems TDSS addresses resist precise formulation, are irreducibly normative, and are better understood as treated rather than solved (Miller 2013; Spangenberg 2011). TDSS problems operate at multiple scales, involving social and ecological elements across space and time, and exhibit non-linear behaviour (Miller 2013). Because these problems cut across multiple sectors, including science, policy, technology and business, often in unprecedented ways, formulaic responses must give way to highly contextual responses that make use of heuristic strategies targeted at overcoming specific types of challenges. Responses to TDSS problems take many forms, from large-scale initiatives to smaller-scale projects focusing on specific problems that lend themselves to treatment by teams of collaborators. These smaller projects often focus on research, development, or both in a particular location. In this chapter, we focus our attention on the project level. Not surprisingly, complex TDSS projects confront many challenges, from uncertainty on the side of society to methodological incommensurability on the side of science (Lang et al. 2012). Principal among these challenges are those that turn on communication, understood as involving both social relationships and information. Successful communication by collaborators in TDSS projects builds the common ground and mutual understanding necessary to support effective responses to TDSS problems. Fortunately, there are ways to respond to communication challenges when they arise. Responses range from tools (e.g. concept mapping) that can be used to address specific challenges, to broader approaches (e.g. deliberative strategies) that can facilitate communication at all stages of the project. We consider these tools and approaches heuristics, in that they supply details about how to respond to novel situations and as such are sensitive to the unique nature of each challenge, exhibiting the kind of ‘ecological rationality’ that Huutoniemi (Chapter 1, this volume) argues is the hallmark of heuristics. While others have addressed the broad range of challenges confronting TDSS (e.g. Lynam et al. 2007; Lang et al. 2012), our focus is more limited. Concentrating on communication in the context of TDSS decision-making at the project level, we review several best practices that use communication heuristics, illustrating them with recent examples from the literature. After first providing a characterization of communication, we briefly survey communication challenges that can undermine decisions aimed at advancing TDSS project goals. These challenges motivate attention to responses. Drawing from the social psychology of small groups and sociocultural theory of learning, we describe several tested, heuristic responses to communication challenges that arise at each stage of a TDSS project within diverse decisionmaking groups. In describing these responses, we illustrate our points with recent examples from TDSS research and emphasize mechanisms that have yet to receive sustained attention in the TDSS literature. © 2014 selection and editorial material, Katri Huutoniemi and Petri Tapio; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Novakian Concept maps (N-Cmaps) and the hierarchical reductionism method are combined to create a new pedagogic architecture to address highcomplexity issues in classrooms. This strategy considers the epistemological challenge of managing a substantial amount of information from diverse disciplinary fi elds and the need to engage students in productive, collaborative work sessions to generate the synergistic effect of combining many informed individuals' perspectives. Discussions through peer collaboration can be organised to achieve the creation of a knowledge model (KW), i.e. A hypertext structure containing a collection of N-Cmaps with any digital resources about the fi eld under study. Students create their own hypertext and use it as visual resource of information to navigate through the complexity they are learning. After discussing the theoretical foundations that underlie our instructional design, we present a case study involving the collaborative creation of a KM to characterise the interdisciplinary connections among six undergraduate courses offered at the School of Arts, Sciences and Humanities (University of São Paulo, Brazil). Fifty-two students worked collaboratively to map the connections among these courses and the results revealed an interesting perspective. The structured approach adopted to organise the collaborative knowledge construction process allowed students to make explicit several latent information about the courses they were enrolled. The possibility of reducing cognitive overload explains why the combination of N-Cmaps and the hierarchical reductionism method is useful to grasp complexity in classrooms. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

AB  - Given the vast amount of information readily available through the Internet in different forms of representation, learners need to organize their knowledge strategically in order to make a sound argument, especially on a complex topic such as socioscientific issues. In this study, we designed a science unit on nuclear energy using a newly developed online knowledge and learning management system that offers three types of representations: pictorial, textual, and concept maps. We investigated how learners organized their knowledge with multiple external representations and how their knowledge organization practices interacted with their argumentation. Our results indicated that concept maps and wiki entries were more connected than the pictorial modes in the network of knowledge entries created by the learners. Moreover, we found evidence showing that students' knowledge organization enabled them to draw information while arguing and that their argumentation guided them to advance their knowledge organization practices. © 2014 ISLS.

AB  - Digital knowledge maps are rich sources of information to track students' learning. However, making sense of concept maps has been found challenging. Using multiple quantitative and qualitative methods in combination allows triangulating of changes in students' understanding. This chapter introduces novel form of concept map, called knowledge integration map (KIM), and uses KIMs as examples for an overview of concept map analysis methods. Kims are a form of digital knowledge maps. Kims have been implemented in high school science classrooms to facilitate and assess complex science topics, such as evolution. Kim analysis aims to triangulate changes in learners' conceptual understanding through a multilevel analysis strategy, combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Quantitative analysis included overall, selected, and weighted propositional analysis using a knowledge integration rubric and network analysis describing changes in network density and prominence of selected concepts. Research suggests that scoring only selected propositions can be more sensitive to measuring conceptual change because it focuses on key concepts of the map. Qualitative analysis of KIMs included topographical analysis methods to describe the overall geometric structure of the map and qualitative analysis of link types. This chapter suggests that a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis methods can capture different aspects of KIMs and can provide a rich description of changes in students' understanding of complex topics. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

AB  - It is possible that e-textbook readers and tablet PC's will become mainstream reading devices in the future. However, knowledge about instructional design in this field of learning sciences is inadequate. This study aimed to analyse how two factors, that is, presentation methods and concept maps, interact with cognitive load and learning outcomes when the contents of e-textbooks are compiled. Further, it endeavored to suggest an adequate logic of instructional design based on the findings. An empirical method was adopted, and 78 participants - either undergraduates or graduates in college - were recruited. Regarding the compilation of e-textbooks, the findings can be summarised as follows: (a) Providing concept maps not only reduces learners' cognitive load but also enhances their learning outcomes of cognition, affection, and psychomotor performance. (b) Overall, video (V) is superior to text and diagram interaction (TDI) in terms of learning outcomes, and TDI is superior to text and diagram (T&D). Nevertheless, within the cognitive domain, learning outcomes produced by V are not necessarily superior to those produced by TDI. When learners are not provided with concept maps, TDI is superior to V in terms of learning outcomes. Conversely, if learners are provided with concept maps, V is superior to TDI. © Australasian Journal of Educational Technology 2014.

AB  - The combination of the process of pedagogical planning within the Blended (b-)learning environment with the users' quality of interaction (QoI) with the Learning Management System (LMS), serving as an effective feedback, is explored here. The required QoI (both for teachers and students) is estimated by adopting a fuzzy logic-based modeling approach, namely FuzzyQoI, applied to LMS Moodle data from two academic teaching of dance disciplines, including rare and contemporary dances, respectively. The latter are used as paradigms that comply with the educational scenarios of the i-Treasures project (www.i-treasures.eu), which refers to the intangible cultural heritage. Based on documental analysis, the pedagogical design strategies per semester were transcribed to concept maps and the dynamically (per week) estimated QoIs were presented as feedback to the teachers at the end of the first semester, so they could reflect and update their pedagogical planning, anticipating more enhanced QoI at the second one. The results presented here show the beneficial role of QoI to shift the educational scenarios and strategies towards a more dynamic design, yet taking into consideration the inherent tendencies and attitudes of the users' interaction within the blearning context.

AB  - Researching conceptual understanding and development in learning requires recording and evaluating students' knowledge structures, either collaboratively or individually formed, but also requires investigating equally the learning process as well as the learning outcomes. The dynamic nature of knowledge maps, their potential as a life-long learning strategy, and their evaluation through a valid assessment protocol could serve those requirements. The following chapter records a case study in which 16 sixth grade students (10 years old) participated of a Greek state elementary school of an urban area, randomly selected. The students constructed and revised digital knowledge maps at various phases of a Science course both individually and in pairs. The research process involved collecting a succession of individually and collaboratively constructed knowledge maps. The series of knowledge maps was evaluated with a specifi cally designed protocol to assess multiple aspects of the knowledge structure process. The research aims at highlighting knowledge maps as a more sensitive assessment method of the learning process, compared to traditional tests and at underlining their effective use as a monitoring and assessment tool in collaborative environments. Results showed that graphics such concepts maps are more sensitive to subtle changes in student's understanding. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

AB  - Due to rapid advancement in the field of computer communication there has been a lot of research in development of Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). However ITS fails to pinpoint the exact concept the student is deficient in. We propose the development of an Intelligent Diagnostic and Remedial learning system which aims to diagnose the exact concept the student is deficient in. The proposed system composed of three modules is derived from David Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning which consists of three learning elements. The system is implemented in mobile environment using Android Emulator. Finally an experiment was conducted with a set of 60 students majoring in computer science. Experimental results clearly show that the system improves the performance of the learners for whom they are intended. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - This paper presents a study describing the development of an Evaluation Framework (EF) for data competitions in TEL. The study applies the Group Concept Method (GCM) to empirically depict criteria and their indicators for evaluating software applications in TEL. A statistical analysis including multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering on the GCM data identified the following six evaluation criteria: 1.Educational Innovation, 2.Usability, 3.Data, 4.Performance, 5.Privacy, and 6.Audience. Each of them was operationalized through a set of indicators. The resulting Evaluation Framework (EF) incorporating these criteria was applied to the first data competition of the LinkedUp project. The EF was consequently improved using the results from reviewers' interviews, which were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. The outcome of these efforts is a comprehensive EF that can be used for TEL data competitions and for the evaluation of TEL tools in general. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - We attack the problem of learning concepts automatically from noisy Web image search results. The idea is based on discovering common characteristics shared among subsets of images by posing a method that is able to organise the data while eliminating irrelevant instances. We propose a novel clustering and outlier detection method, namely Concept Map (CMAP). Given an image collection returned for a concept query, CMAP provides clusters pruned from outliers. Each cluster is used to train a model representing a different characteristics of the concept. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art studies on the task of learning from noisy web data for low-level attributes, as well as high level object categories. It is also competitive with the supervised methods in learning scene concepts. Moreover, results on naming faces support the generalisation capability of the CMAP framework to different domains. CMAP is capable to work at large scale with no supervision through exploiting the available sources. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - The iCollaborate Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) project is a multiyear, multifaceted research project designed to understand how student learning outcomes, student engagement, and successful course completion rates in introductory MSE courses are affected by a variety of programs and activities that are based upon best practices from STEM education research. A number of interventions and active techniques were used in the classroom, at first, singularly and, as the project progressed, in various combinations. Additionally, a wide variety of faculty and student resources were created as part of this project. For example, test device MSE iPod applications were developed for iCollaborate: Concept Questions, Vocabulary, Basic Knowledge, Tune-Up, Material Properties, Composite Calculator, MSE Convert, and MSE Knowledge Tools and Review. Furthermore, a concept map based web site, which includes web applications of key iPod applications is currently under construction. Initially, the purpose of the website was envisioned as a repository of project resources, but as our research proceeded, it became obvious that the students perceived the concept map and web tools as essential parts of the project and their view of their personal success strategies. Overall, the basic principles implemented in the project are supported by theory based in cognitive and social constructivism and the substantial body of evidence that favors collaborative learning and the inductive approach over the traditional lecture driven, deductive teaching approach. Collaborative learning, active/inquiry learning, concept learning, peer learning, problem/case-based learning, low stakes quizzing, mini-lectures with just-in-time reading, collaborate research writing, and constructive alignment are all part of the project. The newly developed iCollaborate learning exercises are conceptually targeted, designed to provide scaffolds to prior knowledge, and are active, inquiry based modules. Not surprisingly, we found that students come to the course with different levels of preparation and that scores in prerequisite courses do matter, but these are not always perfect indicators that key information from those courses was retained. Students enter the course with a wide range of learning styles, and some prerequisite information is retained or learned differently based on individual learning styles (as measured by our assessments). Based on our findings, we recommend that every instructor evaluate the prerequisite knowledge of their students and complete targeted interventions aimed at known robust MSE misconceptions and local knowledge gaps. Overall, the students were able to understand the relationships between the collaborative assignments, the low stakes quizzes, and the mini-lectures in helping them learn different types of concepts. This paper concentrates on previously unreported components of the iCollaborate project that were investigated, evaluated, or developed during the 2012-2013 academic year. The development of the iCollaborate concept map and web applications web site is emphasized in this paper. The paper concludes with a summary of findings thus far from the project and a discussion of future directions and research opportunities. The plans for the final year of the project will be discussed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.

AB  - Chemistry courses remain a challenge for many undergraduate students. In particular, first-semester organic chemistry has been labeled as a gatekeeper with high attrition rates, especially among students of color. Our study examines a key factor related to conceptual understanding in science and predictive of course outcomes - knowledge structures. Previous research on knowledge structures has focused on differences between experts and novices. Given the increasing ethnic diversity of college classrooms and research indicating unique differences in certain higher order cognitive processes associated cultural practices and ethnicity, it is important to investigate whether similar patterns exist with respect to knowledge structures. Our study utilized concept maps to measure knowledge structures. Two separate analyses where performed to determine whether or not ethnically diverse students' organize their knowledge of organic chemistry content in structurally different ways. The first analysis utilized concept map proposition scoring to examine the influence of prior science achievement and ethnicity on knowledge structures. The second analysis examined holistic map structures to determine whether or not ethnically diverse students show qualitatively distinct structures overall. Results show significant mean differences on concept map proposition scores related to both prior science achievement and ethnic group membership. However, examination of holistic structures revealed that students' qualitative holistic structures did not vary by ethnic group membership. Taken together, our findings suggest that variation in students' knowledge structures are related to prior science achievement across ethnic groups, not qualitative differences in the ways ethnically diverse students' structure knowledge. Implications for teaching and learning in organic chemistry are discussed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Improving students scientific explanations is one major goal of science education. Both writing activities and concept mapping are reported as effective strategies for enhancing student learning of science. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a teaching model, named the DCI model, which integrates a Descriptive explanation writing activity, Concept mapping, and an Interpretive explanation writing activity, is introduced in a 4th grade science class to see if it would improve students' scientific explanations and understanding. A quasi-experimental design, including a non-randomized comparison group and a pre- and post-test design, was adopted for this study. An experimental group of 25 students were taught using the DCI teaching model, while a comparison group received a traditional lecture teaching. A rubric and content analysis was used to assess students' scientific explanations. The independent sample t test was used to measure difference in conceptual understanding between the two groups, before and after instruction. Then, the paired t test analysis was used to understand the promotion of the DCI teaching model. The results showed that students in the experimental group performed better than students in the comparison group, both in scientific concept understanding and explanation. Suggestions for using concept mapping and writing activities (the DCI teaching model) in science classes are provided in this study. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In this paper, we describe the effects of using Kit-Build concept map (KB-map) method as a supportive tool for the reading comprehension of English texts as EFL reading. Reading comprehension is the ability to read text, it is intentional, active, interactive process in all the stages of study for the students and in the daily working activities. One of the most common research points in this field is the English as Foreign Language (EFL) reading comprehension. We have conducted an experiment composed of six experimental reading comprehension sessions. We found that there is no significant difference in the comprehension between the two conditions groups just after the experimental using, but there is noticed difference in the comprehension two weeks after. It shows that the using of KB-map building helps learners to keep their information for long time, and we can say that the using of KB-Map help the students to use and recall, after two weeks, most of the information that are included in their student map. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - This paper investigates an experienced high school science teacher's content knowledge for teaching Doppler Effect to Grade 12 learners. The topic is new in the physical science National Curriculum Statement and therefore posing some difficulties for teachers when teaching. The aim of this paper is to investigate the content knowledge that the teacher has in order to teach this unfamiliar topic. A research question about what content knowledge for teaching does an experienced teacher possess is answered in this paper. A teacher was interviewed and observed when teaching. A concept map was then constructed based on what was taught. The concept map was then given to different experts for validation of the content before the analysis. Quantitative analysis using the constructs of correctness, connectedness and complexity was then applied and the qualitative analysis was done based on the actual details on the map. In terms of correctness, the findings revealed that the teacher showed a good understanding of Doppler Effect. However, there were some few incorrect links that contributed to the score. There were also only four cross links made by the teacher from his teaching which affected connectedness of the map and hence his conceptual understanding of the topic.

AB  - A concept map for taking biodiversity to school is proposed here using a novel approach that combines systematics, evolutionary biology, and the nature of science. The concept map is tied to the recently published next generation science standards (NGSS). The problem of biodiversity is presented as a way to justify the need to take it to school. Biological classification is presented as a hypothesis about order in nature that is based on the evolutionary history of the organisms. Classification is the reference system of the entirety of biology with predictive and explanatory power. Homology is the concept that connects systematics to evolutionary biology. Evolutionary biology explains and systematics reflects the unity and diversity of life. © Copyright 2014 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.

AB  - Introduction: the objectives of this study are to appreciate the evolution of cystis fibrosis patient's perceptions about lung transplantation, one-two years after transplantation in order to identify their educational needs, and to collect their proposals to improve the preparation for transplantation. Method: Qualitative Study led by interviews with nine patients on the base of their concept map realized before the transplantation. Results: The patients confirm most of their initial perceptions. Some evolve positively (less pain, management of medicine easier than planned), others in a more negative sense (resuscitation, difficulty to have professional activity). The suggestions to improve preparation for transplantation are: stress management, psychological and physical preparation, quality of information during preparation and about period of resuscitation, meeting with transplanted patients, relations with caregivers. Conclusion: A list of competencies for patient therapeutic education before lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis is proposed. This list is useful for elaborating educational sessions to increase patient learning and to structure a therapeutic educational program around transplantation. © 2014 EDP Sciences, SETE.

AB  - Scholars have identified that learning in an authentic environment with quality contextual and procedural supports can engage students in thorough observations and knowledge construction. Moreover, the target is that students are able to experience and make sense of all of the learning activities in the real-world environment with meaningful supports, such that their learning motivation can be promoted, knowledge can be sensibly constructed, and skills can be fully developed. To develop potential tutoring strategies and learning activity models using mobile, wireless, and sensing information and communication technologies (ICT) in a real-world learning environment, a four-year national e-learning research project entitled "Mindtool-Assisted In-field Learning (MAIL)" has been funded by the National Science Council of Taiwan since 2008 in an effort to lead the development and innovation of Learning Technology. The integrated project aimed to develop Mindtool-assisted knowledge construction models, assessment models, guidance models, and reflection strategies for cutting-edge context-aware ubiquitous learning. Moreover, a series of learning activities has been conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed learning strategies and models. Each year, more than 1,500 students have participated in the in-field learning activities with the designed approaches. Based on the results of a series of experiments, it was found that the students' learning performance as well as their in-field inquiry ability was significantly improved, showing the effectiveness of the Mindtool-assisted ubiquitous learning approach and the success of the MAIL project. In this paper, the background, objectives, theoretical foundations, systems, research issues, applications, and findings of the MAIL project are presented. Finally, the scaling-up plan for applying these research-proven learning models to all levels of educational settings in Taiwan is also addressed. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - A group of engineering and education faculty members at Virginia Tech received a five-year (2004-2009) grant through the Department-Level Reform (DLR) program of the National Science Foundation. The goal of the project was to adopt the spiral curriculum approach to the bioprocess engineering option within the undergraduate BSE program at Virginia Tech. The spiral curriculum approach is based on the work of Jerome Bruner. The first step of implementing the approach was to define overall outcomes that focused on professional skills. Then the researchers developed concept maps to identify knowledge areas, or subject matter expertise, related to each outcome. For each subject matter or knowledge area identified, they selected the specific topics that the students need to know to attain each outcome. The researchers also developed learning modules, such as combinations of learning activities, to facilitate student achievement of a set of learning objectives, as well as activities to assess student learning.

AB  - The present research is a survey study carried out on pre-service teachers in the Education Faculty at Celal Bayar University (n=174). The study employed a questionnaire consisting of close-ended and semi-open-ended questions administered to determine the opinions of pre-service teachers about the alternative assessment-evaluation approaches they prefer. Furthermore, the self-efficacy scale was used to determine the efficacy of pre-service teachers towards alternative assessment-evaluation approaches. As shown by the results of the analysis, the pre-service teachers stated that they would like to use frequently instruments such as portfolios, performance assessment, concept maps, observation, and concept cartoons in their future teaching careers. Moreover, the MANOVA results revealed a significant difference in the self-efficacy of pre-service teachers about alternative assessment-evaluation approaches according to gender, while it did not significantly differ with the variables of department and grade. On the basis of the obtained results, certain suggestions are made with regard to the use of alternative assessment-evaluation approaches. © 2014 Eǧitim ve Bilim Dergisi.

AB  - The Online Course Tool for Adaptive Learning (OCTAL) is an adaptive exercise system that customizes the progression of question topics to each student. By creating a concept dependency graph of topics in a course and modeling a student's knowledge state, the tool presents questions that test knowledge within a student's zone of proximal development. We intend OCTAL to be a formative assessment tool that is not tied to any specific course by providing language-agnostic questions on computer science concepts. While the tool will be generalizable for many courses, our first prototype includes a concept map and question set for UC Berkeley's introductory computer science course, CS10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing. Using the tool, we will launch an experiment in the spring to investigate metacognitive improvements in the identification of knowledge gaps by presenting online course material in a nonlinear fashion.

AB  - The goal of this study was to explore how designated experts (subject experts with extensive experience in science education and concept mapping) and novices (pre-service teachers) establish concept map (CM) development processes while considering their cognitive processes. Two experiments were conducted in which eye-tracking, written, and verbal data were collected from 29 novices and 6 subject matter experts. The results showed that despite some similar strategies, novices and experts followed different patterns during the CM development process. Both experts and novices embraced deductive reasoning and preferred hierarchical type CMs. Additional points studied during the process include filling out requested information in different orders, branch construction pattern, content richness and progress pattern. Furthermore, eye behavior patterns also differed among experts and novices. Expert participants differed from novices in all eye behavior metrics (fixation count, fixation and visit duration for specific actions). Novices' fixation count (FC) numbers were higher than the experts' during the entire process and in specific periods. In conclusion, these pattern differences affect the CM development process directly. Considering the patterns revealed in the study may help instructors guide learners more adequately and effectively. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge structure is an important aspect for defining students' competency in biology learning, but how knowledge structure is influenced by the teaching process in naturalistic biology classroom settings has scarcely been empirically investigated. In this study, 49 biology lessons in the teaching unit blood and circulatory system in 9th grade German classrooms were videotaped and analyzed. Before the lesson, a questionnaire was administered to the students to solicit their responses about learning motivation. After the lesson, students' learning outcomes on knowledge structure were examined with the concept mapping method. The video coding used in this study focused on the knowledge linking levels during the biology lesson. Out of the 49 classes, those with the highest and those with the lowest linking levels were selected based on the coding results. In high-linking classes, interrelated facts were introduced more often in the lessons, whereas in the lessons of the low-linking classes, isolated pieces of knowledge were predominant. The results from the concept mapping task showed that the students in the high-linking classes constructed more correct relations among the concepts compared to the students in the low-linking classes. The results remained stable even after controlling for learning motivation. These findings confirm the importance of teaching interrelated facts and concepts instead of isolated facts for fostering students' knowledge structure. As a result, based on the Bavarian biology curriculum, we develop materials and programs to enable students, student teachers, and teachers to focus on interrelated facts and basic concepts instead of isolated facts in biology lessons. © 2013 National Science Council, Taiwan.

AB  - Researchers at the University of Colorado Denver (U(D) are focusing on computer design. constructi\e learning theory and cognitive linguistics to develop and test a cloud computing learning system to increase achievement among students in the STEM disciplines. This paper describes Efficient Learning Maps (eLms), an education technology designed to enhance logical thinking through the construction of concept maps using seven basic graphic symbols that represent logical operations. After and presenting evidence that the technology may prove cffectic and a strong need exists for effective education technologies the paper asks the question as to why the Visual Logic Maps technology appears work as intended when recent reports indicate that the efficacy of education technologies have resulted in negative or negligible results. The researchers of this paper suggest that the reason for the effectiveness of one technology versus others can be explained by I) the design of the software which uses enhancement of mapping skills to enhance reading comprehension and vice versa: and 2) the findings of social scientists and media studies experts associated with Marshall MeLuhan and the hypothesis of left and right brain diffcrcnce. The paper concludes with the obser',ation that before educators and software engineers can deselop computer applications to advance knowledge and improve learning, they must first ask the basic question as to what constitutes knos ledge in the twenty-first century lien new technotogies may be changing our very understanding of knos ledge iiself.

AB  - Knowledge Assessment is an important part of the learning process as it allows the learner to keep track of their progress in the knowledge acquisition process. There are several types of assessment techniques. Among them, we find questions with short and open answers (SOA Questions). The evaluation of these questions with open and short answers, where the learner has to develop a response going of some words to 5 lines, constitutes a type of complex assessment technique. This paper presents a novel approach regarding knowledge assessment of SOA questions using concept maps. We propose a scenario for using this type of questions in online learning environments and describe our approach for automatically evaluating this type of questions using concept maps and similarities measures. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effects of creating concept maps by using paper and pencil on primary school students critical thinking skills in science education. Experimental research model was used with pre- and post-test control group design. The participants of the study were 60 6th graders (ages 11-12) at a primary school, which was randomly chosen among the public primary schools in Uskudar, Istanbul, during the 2011-2012 school period. The experimental group and the control group were designated objectively among the student groups that have similar characteristics. Implementation period had lasted for 20 class hours in total. The reliability coefficient of the critical thinking skills scale (the Cronbach alpha) was 0.87. It was seen that there were significant differences between the critical thinking scores of the students who created their concept maps by using paper and pencil and those of the students who were instructed not to create the concept maps. Thus, it could be said that creating the concept maps enables the students to develop their critical thinking skills in science education.

AB  - Interactive tabletops can be used to provide new ways to support face-to-face collaborative learning. A little explored and somewhat hidden potential of these devices is that they can be used to enhance teachers' awareness of students' progress by exploiting captured traces of interaction. These data can make key aspects of collaboration visible and can highlight possible problems. In this paper, we explored the potential of an enriched tabletop to automatically and unobtrusively capture data from collaborative interactions. By analyzing that data, there was the potential to discover trends in students' activity. These can help researchers, and eventually teachers, to become aware of the strategies followed by groups. We explored whether it was possible to differentiate groups, in terms of the extent of collaboration, by identifying the interwoven patterns of students' speech and their physical actions on the interactive surface. The analysis was validated on a sample of 60 students, working in triads in a concept mapping learning activity. The contribution of this paper is an approach for analyzing students' interactions around an enriched interactive tabletop that is validated through an empirical study that shows its operationalization to extract frequent patterns of collaborative activity. © 2013 International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc. and Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Concept maps are playing an increasingly important role in various computing fields. In particular, they have been popularly used for organizing and representing knowledge. However, constructing concept maps manually is a complex and time-consuming task. Therefore, the creation of concept maps automatically or semi-automatically from text documents is a worthwhile research challenge. Recently, various approaches for automatic or semi-automatic construction of concept maps have been proposed. However, these approaches suffer from several limitations. First, only the noun phrases in text documents are included without resolution of the anaphora problems for pronouns. This omission causes important propositions available in the text documents to be missed, resulting in decreased recall. Second, although some approaches label the relationship to form propositions, they do not show the direction of the relationship between the subject and object in the form of Subject-Relationship- Object, leading to ambiguous propositions. In this paper, we present a cluster-based approach to semi-automatically construct concept maps from text documents. First, we extract the candidate terms from documents using typed dependency linguistic rules. Anaphoric resolution for pronouns is introduced to map the pronouns with candidate terms. Second, the similarities are calculated between the pairs of extracted candidate terms of a document and clusters are made through affinity propagation by providing the calculated similarities between the candidate terms. Finally, the extracted relationships are assigned between the candidate terms in each cluster. Our empirical results show that the semi-automatically constructed concept maps conform to the outputs generated manually by domain experts, since the degree of difference between them is proportionally small based on a Likert scale. Furthermore, domain experts verified that the constructed concept maps are in accordance with their knowledge of the information system domain. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - Self-evaluation is not an easy step for learners even if it is a decisive step in self-regulated learning. The goal of our study was to test concept maps effect on learning performance and self-evaluation accuracy. 136 students were assigned over five experimental groups in which the format used (consultation/construction) and the moment of use (simultaneous of the learning task vs. after the learning task) of concept map varied. Cognitive load was also measured in order to explain differences in performance and self-evaluation. Results suggested that participants in the consultation conditions have a more accurate self-evaluation and better performance than participants in the construction condition. More studies are required to identify more precisely what factors influence the efficiency of use conceptual map.

AB  - Concept map is a technique that arranges knowledge in a form of connected nodes. In our hypothesis, applying a concept map approach in teaching and learning History as a courseware can improve students' understanding and cognitive development. Therefore, we developed a courseware to complement the text book and were distributed to students in a Secondary School. For the purpose of this study, an experimental assessment was conducted among students where twenty students responded and went through the courseware assessment session. They filled in a form which was purposely designed to assess the effectiveness of the concept map instructional delivery and learner-friendliness of the design interface. In particular, the study looked at the effectiveness of a simulated learning experience, interface design as well as the technical aspects of the courseware. The findings from the study suggested that, in general, an implementation of concept map has been effective and useful. The outcome of the study concluded that concept map is one of the promising methods that can be effectively used to teach history in secondary students. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - In this study, we investigated whether concept maps were used as often and as effectively in elementary science and technology classrooms as recommended by the National Ministry of Education (MEB) in the new curricula in Turkey. In the new elementary science and technology curricula, the MEB provides a general concept map for each unit. We used concept maps provided for the Light and Sound units for fourth, fifth, and sixth grades as content to determine whether students were able to use concept maps to gather information from them. Our analyses showed that most of the students did not use the concept maps to answer the questions. Rather they used their own knowledge and cognitive structures about light and sound to answer the questions. Therefore, we concluded that students do not know how to read the concept maps and gather knowledge from them. Also, we ran an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test to explore whether grade level has an effect on students' performance in reading the concept maps and gathering information from them. We found that grade level has a significant effect on students' performance in using concept maps. © 2006-2013 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The paper details an exploratory qualitative study that investigated 61 prospective teachers' conceptual understanding of dissolving salt and sugar in water respectively. The study was set within a 15-week elementary science methods course that included a 5E learning cycle lesson on dissolving, the instructional context. Oversby's (Prim Sci Rev 63:6-19, 2002, Aspects of teaching secondary science, Routledge Falmer, London, 2002) ladder of explanations for the context of dissolving, current scientific explanations for dissolving and perspectives on conceptions and misconceptions provided the unified framework for the study. Concept maps, interview transcripts, written artifacts, and drawings and narratives were used as data to investigate these prospective teachers' conceptual understanding of dissolving throughout the 15-weeks of the methods course. Analysis revealed that participants' explanations of dissolving were predominantly descriptive explanations (39 %) and interpretative explanations (38 %), with lower percentage occurrences of intentional (14 %) and cause and effect (9 %) level explanations. Most of these explanations were also constructed by a set of loosely connected and reinforcing everyday concepts abstracted from common everyday experiences making them misconceptions. Implications include: (1) the need for science teacher educators to use multiple platforms to derive their prospective elementary teachers' conceptual understandings of science content; and (2) to identify and help them identify their own scientific conceptions and misconceptions and how they influence the construction of scientific/nonscientific explanations. Science teacher educators also need to emphasize the role of meaningful frameworks associated with the concept that is being introduced during the Engage phase of the 5E learning cycle. This is important because, relevant prior knowledge is associated with the knowledge of the particle theory of matter and both are part of larger knowledge system comprised of interrelated scientific concepts. © 2013 The Association for Science Teacher Education, USA.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to explore that using creative problem solving can promote students' performance of concept mapping (CMPING). Students were encouraged to use creative problem solving (CPS) in constructing nanometer knowledge structure, and then to promote the performance of CMPING. The knowledge structure was visualized through CMPING which helps students to improve their performance. The participants were 42 college juniors who selected the course "Nano-environmental Engineering Technology". Four instruments were used to classify student learning performance (meaningful learning, rote learning and non-learning). This study included three main issues: (1) Student learning quality was determined by the change in concept map construction. (2) In-depth interviews were applied to understand student's CPS process. (3) Student interaction quality in a discussion board on a web-platform was evaluated. The results showed that meaningful high-level learners successfully applied CPS in constructing concept maps and they presented better performance of CMPING. Rote learners' results were in the second place, and non-learners achieved the worse outcomes. It is suggested that a future teaching study can use creative problem solving to promote students' performance of CMPING in other courses. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Some task analysis methods break down a task into a hierarchy of subgoals. Although an important tool of many fields of study, learning to create such a hierarchy (redescription) is not trivial. To further the understanding of what makes task analysis a skill, the present research examined novices' problems with learning Hierarchical Task Analysis and captured practitioners' performance. All participants received a task description and analyzed three cooking and three communication tasks by drawing on their knowledge of those tasks. Thirty six younger adults (18-28 years) in Study 1 analyzed one task before training and five afterwards. Training consisted of a general handout that all participants received and an additional handout that differed between three conditions: a list of steps, a flow-diagram, and concept map. In Study 2, eight experienced task analysts received the same task descriptions as in Study 1 and demonstrated their understanding of task analysis while thinking aloud. Novices' initial task analysis scored low on all coding criteria. Performance improved on some criteria but was well below 100 % on others. Practitioners' task analyses were 2-3 levels deep but also scored low on some criteria. A task analyst's purpose of analysis may be the reason for higher specificity of analysis. This research furthers the understanding of Hierarchical Task Analysis and provides insights into the varying nature of task analyses as a function of experience. The derived skill components can inform training objectives. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Constructivist learning theory is used to examine students' individual understandings from a collaborative science-writing project on alternative energies supported by Web 2.0 technologies. We examine how high school chemistry students (n=30) make sense of alternative energy constructs through analyzing changes in pre- and post-intervention concept maps. Through statistical and structural analysis of their concept maps, we investigate changes in the students' understandings about alternative energy. Our findings suggest that students increased their knowledge about alternative energies at different levels, reflecting both surface and deep learning of related environmental education concepts, as well as creating strong connections between concepts related to safety, costs, and health for different types of alternative energy. In addition, student elaboration increased for all energy types, suggesting that the jigsaw pedagogy was successful in improving individual understandings. © ISLS.

AB  - This paper presents a framework for the evaluation of concept maps. We focus on supporting the student in dealing with ill-structured and complex problems. We argue that these problems require the application of the modularity approach. In view of this, the paper describes ways of providing student support for the implementation of this approach within the context of a concept mapping activity. As a basis we make use findings from the field of brain science and mathematical concepts and tools from the field of network theory, in order to present specific evaluation methods, the further development of which we consider extremely promising.

AB  - Climate change is a complex environmental problem that can be used to examine students' understanding, gained through classroom communication, of climate change and its interactions. The present study examines a series of four science sessions given to a group of primary school student teachers (n = 20). This includes analysis of the communication styles used and the students' pre- and post-conceptualisation of climate change based on results obtained via essay writing and drawings. The essays and drawings concerned the students' unprompted pre- and post-conceptions about climate change, collected before and after each of the four inquiry-based science sessions (in physics, chemistry, biology and geography). Concept mapping was used in the analysis of the students' responses. The communication used in the four sessions was analysed with a communicative approach in order to find out the discussion about climate change between teacher and students. The analyses indicated that the students did not have the knowledge or the courage to participate in discussion, but post-conceptualisation map showed that students' thinking had become more coherent after the four sessions. Given the results of the present study, proposals for using concepts maps and/or communication analysis in studying students' conceptions are presented. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The iCollaborate Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) project is a comprehensive research program that has an overarching goal of improving student outcomes in introductory materials engineering courses. The project is multifaceted and includes several interwoven components, all of which are founded upon literature based best practices in STEM education. The project components include: a detailed study of precourse knowledge and misperceptions, an investigation of student preparation influencing course outcomes, an analysis of Index of Learning Styles (ILS) data, a switch to inductive teaching practices which include collaborative, active learning modules and concept/peer learning opportunities, collaborative writing of research papers, low stakes quizzing, the development of targeted iPod applications that promote enhanced student understanding of known conceptual difficulties, MSE vocabulary terms, visual and conceptually contained presentations of material properties, material calculators and conversion tools, and the development of a web site based upon concept maps. The project includes formative and summative assessment elements. This paper focuses on previously unreported components of the iCollaborate project that were researched, analyzed or developed during the 2011-2012 academic year. A detailed analysis of student preparation coupled with the comprehensive study of pre-course conceptual knowledge and misperceptions provided particularly rich and extremely informative data sets that are outlined in this paper. Additionally, students perceive that low stakes quizzing improve personal outcomes more than the targeted, collaborative and active modules and iPod applications, but traditional test scores indicate all three enhance certain student learning outcomes when at least two are present. The entire suite of MSE iPod applications developed for this project (Concept Questions, Vocabulary, Basic Knowledge, Tune-Up, Material Properties, Composite Calculator, MSE Convert, MSE Knowledge Tools and Review) is described in detail. The supporting web site for the project is currently under development, is concept mapped based, built upon student input/assessments, and targeted to address known conceptual difficulties in MSE. The concept map base for the project is reported in this paper. The paper concludes with a description of the remaining objectives for the iCollaborate project for the next academic year and further dissemination plans. At the conclusion of the project, all materials will be placed on the NSF sponsored National Science Digital Library (NSDL).

AB  - A teachable agent (TA) is an instructional technology that capitalizes on the organizing metaphor of teaching another, in this case, a computer agent. As one instance, students teach their agents by creating concept maps that connect nodes with relational links. TAs use simple artificial intelligence to draw conclusions based on what they have been taught and to trace the path of their reasoning visually. TAs literally make thinking visible, with the goal of helping children learn to reason. TAs also provide interactive feedback and engender in students a sense of responsibility toward improving their agents' knowledge. We describe, in detail, a TA designed to teach hierarchical reasoning in science, and then present a 2-year research study using this TA with 153 fourth-grade children learning about organisms, taxonomies, and ecosystems. We show that the TA improved learning from the standard curriculum as measured by the curriculum's accompanying tests. The TA also helped children learn hierarchical reasoning, as measured by researcher-designed tests. The research indicates that, contrary to some theoretical positions, it is possible to help younger children learn scientific modes of reasoning, specifically by means of TA software. © 2008-2011 IEEE.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to use a comparative approach to scrutinize the common assumption that certain school science activities are theoretical and therefore particularly suited for engaging students with scientific ideas, whereas others are practical and, thus, not equally conducive to engagement with scientific ideas. We compared two school science activities, one (laboratory work) that is commonly regarded as focusing attention on artefacts that may distract students from central science concepts and the other (concept mapping) that is thought to make students focus directly on these concepts. We observed students in either a laboratory activity about real galvanic cells or a concept-mapping activity about idealized galvanic cells. We used a practical epistemology analysis to compare the two activities regarding students' actions towards scientific ideas and artefacts. The comparison revealed that the two activities, despite their alleged differences along the theory-practice scale, primarily resulted in similar student actions. For instance, in both activities, students interacted extensively with artefacts and, to a lesser extent, with scientific ideas. However, only occasionally did students establish any explicit continuity between artefacts and scientific ideas. The findings indicate that some of the problems commonly considered to be unique for school science practical work may indeed be a feature of school science activities more generally. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Many recent studies have reported the benefits of educational computer games in promoting students' learning motivations. On the other hand, however, the effect of digital game-based learning in improving students' learning performance has been questioned. Several previous studies have reported that without properly integrating learning strategies into gaming scenarios, the effectiveness of educational computer games could be limited, or may be even worse than that of the conventional technology-enhanced learning approach. In this study, a concept map-embedded gaming approach is proposed for developing educational computer games by integrating concept mapping as part of the gaming scenarios to help students organize what they have learned during the game-based learning process. Moreover, a role-playing game has been developed for an elementary school natural science course based on the proposed approach. From the experimental results, it is found that the concept map-embedded gaming approach can significantly improve the students' learning achievement and decrease their cognitive load. Moreover, the students who learned with the proposed approach revealed a significantly higher degree of perceived usefulness than those who learned with the conventional game-based learning approach. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Research in contemporary biology has become increasingly complex and organized around understanding biological processes in the context of systems. To better reflect the ways of thinking required for learning about systems, we developed and implemented a pedagogical approach using box-and-arrow models (similar to concept maps) as a foundational tool for instruction and assessment in an Introductory Biology course on genetics, evolution, and ecology. Over the course of one semester, students iteratively constructed, evaluated, and revised "Gene-to-Evolution" (GtE) models intended to promote understanding about the connections linking molecular-level processes with population-level outcomes. In practice, a successful GtE model contextualizes information provided in a case study and explains how genetic-level variation originates at the molecular level, is differentially expressed among individuals, and is acted upon by the environment to produce evolutionary change within a population. Our analyses revealed that students' ability to construct biologically accurate models increased throughout the semester. Model complexity peaked near mid-term then subsequently declined. This suggests that, with time, students were building more parsimonious models, shedding irrelevant information, and improving in their ability to apply accurate and appropriate biological language to explain relationships among concepts. Importantly, we observed the greatest relative gains in model correctness among students who entered the course with lower mean GPA. In an analysis comparing performance among achievement tritiles, lower-performing students effectively closed the achievement gap with the highest performing students by the end of the semester. Our findings support the effectiveness of model-based pedagogies for science teaching and learning, and offer a perspective on pedagogical application of modeling strategies to foster systems thinking and knowledge structuring in college-level biology.

AB  - The challenge of teaching new subject matter is a familiar one for most teachers. This paper investigates the content knowledge gains made by seven teachers as they learn to teach the topic of semiconductors through a process of self-study. 'Semiconductors' is a new topic in the curriculum which looks at the sub-microscopic properties of materials used in electronics and is important because of its applications in modern technology. We present a phenomenographic analysis of 21 concept maps produced by seven teachers at various stages of their self-study project. Four categories of description emerged in the analysis, viz. no meaning, orientation to understanding of subject matter (SMK), a pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) context focus, and a PCK strategy focus. The last category proved to be the most interesting as it suggested that the teacher saw the learning of SMK and learning to teach the SMK as a single process. This finding was considered as important in understanding how teachers learn new SMK for teaching. We found that experienced teachers make sense of their new SMK in different ways. There is a variation of orientation in their learning and sense-making. The data also showed progression of teachers' understanding of the topic through the self-study process. The findings suggest that learning SMK for the purposes of teaching is different to learning for fulfilling the requirements of a study programme. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Following earlier studies aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of digital competence through a review of literature and current digital competence frameworks, this paper focuses on experts' views on digital competence. It describes the results of a Delphi study investigating experts' ideas on what it means to be digitally competent today. The study involved two online consultations, one directed at gathering individual ideas and one directed at validating the aggregated mapping of digital competence, established through various qualitative and quantitative data analysis steps. The paper describes and discusses the final results from the Delphi study involving 95 experts from across Europe and beyond. Results indicate that digital competence is built up of knowledge, skills, and attitudes pertaining to twelve different areas. Besides, results show that several issues of debate can be identified when it comes to establishing the boundaries of digital competence. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The greenhouse effect is a reasonably complex scientific phenomenon which can be used as a model to examine students' conceptual understanding in science. Primary student-teachers' understanding of global environmental problems, such as climate change and ozone depletion, indicates that they have many misconceptions. The present mixed method study examines Finnish primary student-teachers' understanding of the greenhouse effect based on the results obtained via open-ended and closed-form questionnaires. The open-ended questionnaire considers primary student-teachers' spontaneous ideas about the greenhouse effect depicted by concept maps. The present study also uses statistical analysis to reveal respondents' conceptualization of the greenhouse effect. The concept maps and statistical analysis reveal that the primary student-teachers' factual knowledge and their conceptual understanding of the greenhouse effect are incomplete and even misleading. In the light of the results of the present study, proposals for modifying the instruction of climate change in science, especially in geography, are presented. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - To understand genetics, students need to be able to explain and draw connections between a large number of concepts. The purpose of the study reported herein was to explore the way upper secondary science students reason about concepts in molecular genetics in order to understand protein synthesis. Data were collected by group interviews. Concept maps were constructed using the interview transcripts, and analysed. The most central concept was DNA, which served as a link between the concepts of genes and proteins. Students spontaneously introduced concepts from classical genetics to explain molecular genetics. The concept maps generated from the different group interviews were similar in that various concepts consistently appeared within specific sub-groups of interconnected concepts, ie clusters. Five main clusters were identified. The students were better able to relate between concepts within a cluster than between concepts in different clusters. The clusters can be seen as representations of the students knowledge structures, and could be used as starting points in teaching genetics. We recommend that courses in genetics should begin by focusing on students existing connections between concepts from different clusters and then point out concepts that feature in two or more clusters such as DNA, gene, and protein. © 2013 Copyright Society of Biology.

AB  - The concept map tool set forth by Novak and colleagues is underutilized in education. A meta-analysis has encouraged teachers to make extensive use of concept mapping, and researchers have advocated computer-based concept mapping applications that exploit hyperlink technology. Through an NSF sponsored geosciences education grant, middle and secondary science teachers participated in professional development to apply computer-based concept mapping in project-based learning (PBL) units that investigated local watersheds. Participants attended a summer institute, engaged in a summer through spring online learning academy, and presented PBL units at a subsequent fall science teachers' convention. The majority of 17 teachers who attended the summer institute had previously used the concept mapping strategy with students and rated it highly. Of the 12 teachers who continued beyond summer, applications of concept mapping ranged from collaborative planning of PBL projects to building students' vocabulary to students producing maps related to the PBL driving question. Barriers to the adoption and use of concept mapping included technology access at the schools, lack of time for teachers to advance their technology skills, lack of student motivation to choose to learn, and student difficulty with linking terms. In addition to mitigating the aforementioned barriers, projects targeting teachers' use of technology tools may enhance adoption by recruiting teachers as partners from schools as well as a small number that already are proficient in the targeted technology and emphasizing the utility of the concept map as a planning tool. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Two studies were conducted to examine content knowledge changes following 2 weeks of professional development that included scientific research with university scientists. Engaging teachers in scientific research is considered to be an effective way of encouraging knowledge of both inquiry pedagogy and content knowledge. We used concept maps with two cohorts of teachers to assess changes in science teacher knowledge. In study 1, 34 teachers developed pre- and post-concept maps in one of the nine different content areas. A repeated measures analysis of six quantitative scores showed statistically significant increases in knowledge representation. Quantitative and qualitative scoring methods indicate that concept maps are effective for assessing teacher knowledge gains from professional development. Study 2 replicated the results with 24 teachers and provided further information about how knowledge changes. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Public appreciation and basic understanding of the role the ocean plays in the global environment has become more important as the urgency to make decisions on complex environmental issues has increased. Because communicating science to the public is often challenging for scientists, they can benefit from employing methods such as concept mapping, which "deconstructs" science into discrete ideas and organizes them into graphical formats. Responding to recommendations by ocean science faculty who participated in concept-mapping workshops with pre-college educators, four Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence designed, implemented, and evaluated a series of professional development workshops for graduate students. These workshops engaged 20 faculty-level ocean scientists to help 73 graduate students depict complex scientific ideas using concept maps. Evidence shows that operationally breaking down topics and reorganizing them into graphical formats benefited faculty and graduate students alike. Each workshop culminated with the graduate students delivering oral presentations to nonscientist audiences such as high school students. Graduate students were highly rated on their abilities to place topics within a broad societal context. In a follow-up survey, graduate students recognized the potential of concept mapping to enhance their professional skills and to organize their own research. © 2013 by The Oceanography Society.

AB  - We have argued that apps can be used in innovative ways to support science and literacy learning. With the skilled guidance of teachers, students can exploit app affordances for learning and use disciplinary literacies unique to science. For example, students can build conceptual understanding and communicate ideas through the use of concept-mapping, note-taking/annotation, and screencasting apps. These apps allow students to access information and create their own digital products that include rich visual representations. The use of note-taking/annotation apps further supports close reading of science texts. One key affordance across apps involves an awareness of the potential for transfer of visual and verbal analysis. This is evidenced in the use of drawing in the ShowMe and VoiceThread apps, which foster the use of visual representations and narration to convey ideas. The act of inviting viewer commentary into the projects encouraged students to revise the construction of their ideas, their drawings, and verbal explanations. Take Action offers additional ideas for instructional uses of these apps. Our classroom examples serve to illustrate that these app affordances were not simply in the apps but, rather, that they were fostered by how teachers exploited these affordances to achieve their own specific learning objectives. This suggests that, as with any learning tool, teachers who are beginning to incorporate apps into their instruction need to carefully consider how to use these tools in ways that best serve to enhance their students' learning. © 2013 International Reading Association.

AB  - Good conceptual understanding of physics is based on understanding what the key concepts are and how they are related. This kind of understanding is especially important for physics teachers in planning how and in what order to introduce concepts in teaching; connections which tie concepts to each other give direction of progress-there is "flux of information" so that what was learned before provides the basis for learning new ideas. In this study, we discuss how such ordering of concepts can be made visible by using concept maps and how they can be used in analysing the students' views and ideas about the inherent logic of the teaching plans. The approach discussed here is informed by the recent cognitively oriented ideas of knowledge organisation concentrating on simple knowledge organisation patterns and how they form the basis of more complex concept networks. The analysis of such concept networks is then very naturally based on the use of network theory on analysing the concept maps. The results show that even in well-connected maps, there can be abrupt changes in the information flux in the way knowledge is passed from the initial levels to the final levels. This suggests that handling the information content is very demanding and perhaps a very difficult skill for a pre-service teacher to master. © 2012 National Science Council, Taiwan.

AB  - A study was conducted to quantify the effectiveness of concept maps in learning physics in engineering degrees. The following research question was posed: What was the difference in learning results from the use of concept maps to study a particular topic in an engineering course? The study design was quasi-experimental and used a post-test as a measuring instrument. The sample included 114 university students from the School of Industrial Engineering who were divided into two equivalent homogeneous groups of 57 students each. The amount of learning attained by the students in each group was compared, with the independent variable being the teaching method; the experimental group (E. G.) used concept maps, while the control group (C. G.) did not. We performed a crossover study with the two groups of students, with one group acting as the E. G. for the topic of optical fibers and as the C. G. for the topic of the fundamental particles of matter and vice versa for the other group. For each of the two topics studied, the evaluation instrument was a test of 100 dichotomous items. The resulting data were subjected to a comparative statistical analysis, which revealed a significant difference in the amount of learning attained by the E. G. students as compared with the C. G. students. The results allow us to state that for the use of concept maps, the average increment in the E. G. students' learning was greater than 19 percentage points. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The ability to monitor the status of one's own understanding is important to accomplish academic tasks proficiently. Previous studies have shown that comprehension monitoring (metacomprehension accuracy) is generally poor, but improves when readers engage in activities that access valid cues reflecting their situation model (activities such as concept mapping or self-explaining). However, the question still remains as to which process, encoding or retrieving, causes the improvement of metacomprehension accuracy, and the findings of previous research on this matter have been inconsistent. This study examined whether college students' metacomprehension accuracy improves when they expect, at the time of reading, that they will explain the content later (active encoding) or when they actually generate an explanation (encoding plus active retrieving). In the experiments, college students read five texts. During reading, some students expected that they would generate explanations but did not actually generate them. In contrast, some students actually generated an explanation of the text after reading. All students then rated their comprehension of each text. Finally, they completed tests on the materials. Results of both studies revealed that metacomprehension accuracy, operationalized as the association between comprehension ratings and test performance, was greater for the group that actually generated explanations than for the expectancy or control groups. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background: Teaching basic science courses is challenging in undergraduate medical education because of the ubiquitous use of didactic lectures and reward for recall of factual information during examinations. The purpose of this study is to introduce concept maps with clinical cases (the innovative program) to improve learning of biochemistry course content. Methods: Participants were first year medical students (n=150) from Saveetha Medical College and Hospital (India); they were randomly divided into two groups of 75, one group attending the traditional program, the other the innovative program. Student performance was measured using three written knowledge tests (each with a maximum score of 20). The students also evaluated the relevance of the learning process using a 12-item questionnaire. Results: Students in the innovative program using concept mapping outperformed those in the traditional didactic program (means of 7.13-8.28 vs. 12.33-13.93, p<0.001). The students gave high positive ratings for the innovative course (93-100% agreement). Conclusion: The new concept-mapping program resulted in higher academic performance compared to the traditional course and was perceived favorably by the students. They especially valued the use of concept mapping as learning tools to foster the relevance of biochemistry to clinical practice, and to enhance their reasoning and learning skills, as well as their deeper understanding for biochemistry. © 2013 Krishna M.

AB  - What is environment? The answer to this question is fundamental to how we teach environmental studies and sciences (ESS). We follow recent scholarly literature in approaching environment as connection, not as some category of reality, and consider pedagogical implications via concept mapping, a new learning technology. Concept maps potentially offer a visually explicit means of representing and analyzing the hybrid connections between actors that define environmental issues. We explore the utility of concept mapping as pioneered by Joseph Novak and others via the Cmap Tools application, in which concept maps (cmaps) consist of concepts connected by propositions; both can include linked resources, and the resultant cmap can be collaboratively edited and shared online. We evaluate concept mapping in the context of a sophomore-level environmental methods course taught annually at Lewis & Clark College. The course includes adaptations of concept mapping drawing on Novak's work and actor-network theory, designed for students to reflect on their environmental perspectives, synthesize course material, and explore a proposed topic for environmental research. These exercises were evaluated in fall 2010 using self-reports, assessment rubrics, and open-ended student responses. Results showed that higher achieving students generally found concept mapping more demanding and attained more sophisticated understandings of connections. This suggests that concept mapping helps facilitate the intellectual struggle that characterizes engaged learning, yet also that not all students embrace this struggle to fully grasp environment-as-connection. In a larger sense, the study illustrates challenges in cultivating new approaches to environment in the ESS community. © 2013 AESS.

AB  - In physics teacher education, one of the recurrent themes is the importance of fostering the formation of organised and coherent knowledge structures, but a simple shared understanding of what coherence actually means and how it can be recognised, is not easily found. This study suggests an approach in which the coherence of students' views about the relatedness of physics concepts can be identified and evaluated. Six pre-service physics teachers presented their understanding of the relatedness of physics concepts in the form of specially designed concept maps in which experimental or modelling procedures were required as links between physics concepts. The acceptability of the links was evaluated by using four criteria for epistemic analysis introduced in this study. The weighted values describing the maps' structural features were calculated, and finally, the cases were compared and the differences between them were discussed. The results show that the epistemic analysis of links affects remarkably to the acceptability of knowledge and thus also the coherence of such knowledge. The highest criterion set for acceptability seems to be very demanding to fulfil and even in the advanced level of studies only a fraction of students manage to reach it. The cases examined here show that the knowledge structures are partly fragmented and not as coherent as one would have expected them to be. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Science Sifting is designed primarily as a textbook for students interested in research and as a general reference book for existing career scientists. The aim of this book is to help budding scientists broaden their capacities to access and use information from diverse sources to the benefit of their research careers. The book describes why the capacity to access and integrate both linear and nonlinear information has been an important historic feature of pivotal scientific breakthroughs. Yet, it is a process that our students are rarely, if ever, taught in universities. This book goes beyond simply describing the features of great scientific breakthroughs. It discusses the basis for accessing and using nonlinear information in the linear research context. It also provides a series of tools and exercises that can be used to enhance access to nonlinear information for application to research and other endeavors. Topics covered include focal points in scientific breakthroughs, the use of concepts maps in research, use of different vantage points, information as patterns, fractals for the scientist, memory storage and access points, and synchronicities. Young researchers need useful tools to help with a more holistic approach to their research careers. This book provides the useful tools to support flexibility and creativity across a long-term research career. © 2013 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to examine the literacy of senior high school students regarding marine-science concepts by using the concept-map method (open-ended tasks) and an open-ended question, and to assess their misconceptions about marine science. A survey was conducted among students from five senior high schools in northern Taiwan. A total of 361 questionnaires were distributed and a validity count of 346 was returned. The results of this study were as follows: The terms "warming," "earthquake," and "earth" were most commonly used by students to express marine-science concepts. The terms "bioenergy," "Kuroshio Currents," and "Oyashio Currents" caused the most confusion among students. The marine concepts described by the students were more in cognitive domain, than in attitude and affective domains. The students' average correct response rate in the marine-science misconception assessment was 53%. The term "Kuroshio Currents" received the lowest score (16% correct) in the marine-science misconception assessment of students. Students typically misconstrued the following marine-science competence index: "Increases and decreases in sea levels during glacial and interglacial periods may influence global biology and the natural environment." The results of this study can assist marine-science researchers and senior high school teachers to improve the quality and effectiveness of marine-science education and promote marine-science literacy.

AB  - Classroom-based science teaching tends to be dominated by teaching that stifles the students' natural curiosity and eagerness to discover their surroundings. Knowledge makes sense to students particularly when it is learned within the context of an authentic experience. Thus classroom-based science needs to be complimented by out-of-classroom activities which offer direct and relevant information that influences students' learning. Students build new knowledge on already existing schema, thus it is important for both teacher and students to question and evaluate their knowledge to be able to build on solid grounds. This paper illustrates examples of meta-cognitive tools (i.e. Vee diagrams and concept maps) used before and after site-visits to explore the contribution of out-of-classroom activities to the students' biological cognitive development. This research shows that site-visits are a necessary part of science learning because they help students develop observational and reasoning skills, link biology to personal life experiences and contextualise inert classroom knowledge, making it more meaningful and easier to remember.

AB  - Background: Nursing education encounter many challenges and continuously attempt to improve teaching and learning strategies in theory and practice. With the advanced clinical practice and complexity of students' assessment, nursing students who are the future nurses needs to improve their critical thinking and problem solving skills. The role of nurse educators is to develop critical thinking abilities of students through engaging students in active learning and move from the traditional linear way of thinking. Concept mapping (CM) is one strategy that makes learning meaningful. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of concept mapping as a learning strategy on developing care plan for adult 2 clinical course. Students' attitude and satisfaction toward using CM in clinical nursing education were also assessed. Method: Eighteen students enrolled in adult 2 course at College of Nursing, King Saud Bin Abdul Aziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, KSA were included in the study. A quasi experimental design, pre and post test with a control group was utilized. The questionnaire developed to measure students' knowledge and attitude toward using CM. A modified version of the satisfaction questionnaire was used to measure the students' satisfaction with CM. Evaluation of submitted CMs was done to assess effectiveness of using CM in developing care plan for adult 2 clinical course. Results: Results indicated that students' knowledge about CM was improved in the post test. Students reported a positive attitude toward using CM in nursing courses. The mean score for the set of CMs developed by the students at the end of the course was higher. CMs developed at the end of the course were more comprehensive and creative. In addition, students showed high satisfaction with using CM strategy in nursing education. Conclusion and Recommendation: Nursing education requires understanding and should not based on memorization. Concept mapping can enhance students' creative, logical, and critical thinking which improve independent learning. Adopting CM in all nursing courses and non nursing courses were recommended.

AB  - Structured argumentation support environments have been built and used in scientific discourse in the literature. These environments emphasized either on exchanging information or on constructing arguments for presentation. In this work, an intelligent online asynchronous argumentation platform that detects whether the learners address the expected discussion issues is proposed. After each learner issues an argument on the learning platform, a term weighting method is adopted to derive inputs parameters of a SVM classifier. The classifier then determines if the learners' arguments are related to the concept maps outlined by the instructor. Notably, a peer review mechanism is established in this work to improve the quality of term weighting approach. The experimental results revealed that the students in a junior high school participating in argumentation learning activities of natural science were benefited by the proposed argumentation based learning assistance platform. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Design in the 21st century is expanding its effectiveness, influence, and reach through research methods borrowed from other disciplines, such as the social sciences. However, those other disciplines can also benefit by borrowing theoretical and practical understanding from the design field. Speaking and writing skills have long been prized in academia and business, resulting in many universities implementing communication across the curriculum programs. Historically, this "communication" has excluded visual communication or design knowledge. In our increasingly visual culture - and online culture of user-created content - non-designers are called upon in the professional realm to illustrate their ideas. Graduates entering the workforce will encounter situations where they will benefit from possessing some level of design sensibility, even if only to communicate effectively with professional designers. As educators and researchers from different ends of the visual communication spectrum, we believe professional designers should lead the way in integrating visual communications literacy into higher education curricula. They also present an outline of basic design elements and practices that could be incorporated into a visual communication initiative across the curriculum program (or visual communication center), from color, layout, and composition to iterative sketching, modeling, and concept mapping. © Common Ground, Authors, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Creating learning experiences that are meaningful and motivational is crucial in learning. Research demonstrates that effectively organizing ideas via concept maps allows students to view prior knowledge with new perspectives. Recently, embodied computation has emerged as an effective means of meeting educational objectives due to its intuitive, gesture-based control and to its promotion of associating knowledge with physical events. Unfortunately, a majority of systems tailored for such interaction are expensive prototypes. However, the release of depth cameras has brought embodied interaction into the commercial realm, allowing users' bodies to "become" controllers. This research presents a novel, low cost system that provides embodied interaction with a computer and depth camera, through which learners can create concept maps with gestures. Current work involves defining intuitive gestural controls. Future work will involve evaluating the system for use in a classroom with the aim to create opportunities to easily incorporate embodiment into collaborative learning. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - There is evidence that Pen-based Technologies (PBTs) can facilitate radical changes that would make it possible to address problems typically associated with lecture-based pedagogical models. In the context of universitylevel Computer Science studies, there is widespread consensus that PBTs-and tablet PCs, in particular-are tools that have great potential for encouraging interaction in the classroom and promoting a far more dynamic learning environment. In view off the complexity of these types of technology and their explosive evolution, it would be advisable to assist teachers who wish to utilize them by developing strategies based on a conceptualization of their educational capabilities. With this objective in mind, this article analyzes the use of concept maps as tools for modeling both the instructional domain and the PBTs domain. To validate the proposed approach, a number of workshops were conducted, in which professors of Engineering were given a presentation on the educational capabilities of these technologies and then had the opportunity to experiment with tablet PCs and other digital ink devices. Participants completed a prequestionnaire at the start of the workshop; its questions were generated from a generic concept map for the instructional domain, and its purpose was to list each professor's instructional requirements. Next, recommendations for use were developed, based on the PBTs concept map, and converted to the questions on a post-questionnaire completed at the end of the workshop, on which the teachers indicated the degree to which they agreed with the recommendations. More than 70 professors from different departments participated in these workshops, and their overall evaluation was quite favorable.&copy;Common Ground, José-Vicente Benlloch-Dualde, Félix Buendía-García, Juan-Carlos Cano, Sara Blanc, Lenin-Guillermo Lemus-Zúñiga.

AB  - Printed books have long been an important means for people to obtain knowledge; nevertheless, educators have pointed out problems of learning from some printed books, in particular, the lack of learning supports, such as supplementary materials and learning guiding tools. In this study, a concept map-oriented ubiquitous learning approach is proposed for supporting printed science book reading activities for children via mobile devices with QR-code facilities. A quasi-experiment has been conducted in an elementary school to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in which 92 sixth graders participated. The experimental results show that the concept map-oriented ubiquitous learning approach is significantly more helpful to the students in reading printed books than traditional book reading and the conventional ubiquitous learning approach in terms of learning achievements; moreover, the students had a high level of acceptance of such a mobile technology-assisted learning system in terms of "ease of use", "usefulness" and & quotattitude and intention of future use." © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).

AB  - Concept maps have become a widely used educational tool around the globe. The advancements in computerized interface technologies have enabled even more alternatives for using concept maps in teaching and learning. This study investigates the effects of two different touch technology-based concept mapping interaction modes on students' learning achievements and learning attitudes in a natural science course, as well as their degree of acceptance of using concept maps to learn. Ninety two sixth graders were randomly divided into three groups. Experimental Group One was taught using the Interactive Whiteboard (IWB)-based concept mapping approach, Experimental Group Two learned with the touchscreen-based concept mapping approach, while the control group learned with the traditional paper-and-pencil-based concept mapping approach. The experimental results show that, in terms of learning attitudes toward the natural science course and the degree of acceptance of using concept maps to learn, the students were significantly more positive about the two touch technology-based interaction modes than they were about the traditional paper-and-pencil mode. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).

AB  - This paper proposes a scaffolded concept mapping strategy, which considers a student's (high or low) prior knowledge, and provides flexible learning aids (scaffolding and fading) for reading and drawing a concept map. The goal is that the whole class should progress in synchronized fashion through this strategy, with each student achieving meaningful learning. The scaffolding is tailored to the student's needs, with various levels of support. The increasing demand for scaffolding, and its constant evolution, means that software aids are needed. The authors adopted a systematic instructional design, with associated software, to create a learning environment that supports the execution of the strategy. The paper also investigates whether this strategy improved student learning for 54 undergraduates in a database management system course. The results indicate that the students who used the strategy had better learning achievements than those who only experienced traditional lectures. Moreover, the implementation of the strategy received positive student feedback. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Teaching basic science courses is challenging in undergraduate medical education because of the ubiquitous use of didactic lectures and reward for recall of factual information during examinations. The purpose of this study is to introduce concept maps with clinical cases (the innovative program) to improve learning of biochemistry course content. Participants were first year medical students (n=150) from Saveetha Medical College and Hospital (India); they were randomly divided into two groups of 75, one group attending the traditional program, the other the innovative program. Student performance was measured using three written knowledge tests (each with a maximum score of 20). The students also evaluated the relevance of the learning process using a 12-item questionnaire. Students in the innovative program using concept mapping outperformed those in the traditional didactic program (means of 7.13-8.28 vs. 12.33-13.93, p<0.001). The students gave high positive ratings for the innovative course (93-100% agreement). The new concept-mapping program resulted in higher academic performance compared to the traditional course and was perceived favorably by the students. They especially valued the use of concept mapping as learning tools to foster the relevance of biochemistry to clinical practice, and to enhance their reasoning and learning skills, as well as their deeper understanding for biochemistry.

AB  - Background: This study combines work on concept mapping with scripted collaborative learning. Purpose: The objective was to examine the effects of self-regulated science learning through scripting students' argumentative interactions during collaborative 'multimedia-enriched skeleton concept mapping' on meaningful science learning and retention. Programme description: Each concept in the enriched skeleton concept map (ESCoM) contained annotated multimedia-rich content (pictures, text, animations or video clips) that elaborated the concept, and an embedded collaboration script to guide students' interactions. Sample: The study was performed in a Biomolecules course on the Bachelor of Applied Science program in the Netherlands. All first-year students (N=93, 31 women, 62 men, aged 17-33 years) took part in this study. Design and methods: The design used a control group who received the regular course and an experimental group working together in dyads on an ESCoM under the guidance of collaboration scripts. In order to investigate meaningful understanding and retention, a retention test was administered a month after the final exam. Results: Analysis of covariance demonstrated a significant experimental effect on the Biomolecules exam scores between the experimental group and the control, and the difference between the groups on the retention test also reached statistical significance. Conclusions: Scripted collaborative multimedia ESCoM mapping resulted in meaningful understanding and retention of the conceptual structure of the domain, the concepts, and their relations. Not only was scripted collaborative multimedia ESCoM mapping more effective than the traditional teaching approach, it was also more efficient in requiring far less teacher guidance. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Critical pedagogy also searches for new ways to make inclusive schools a reality. An intelligent use of the possibilities of literary texts is becoming nowadays more and more accepted in educational circles. The fact of applying different techniques to expose concept maps and mind maps of literary texts in the classroom, works as an excellent teaching tool especially in the case of students who are unable to immerse into literary texts by themselves. Thus, using literary texts in that particular way either in experimental science subjects or in secondary language learning classes, not only requires a major commitment from the student, but it also provides more coherence among activities and the communicative competence of the student. By including a wide variety of literary text and some specific activities, we boost the grammatical, linguistic and communicative competences of the student on the one hand, and test the linguistic skills of the student on the other. This theoretical article analyses the best options to deal with activities and literary text efficiently while taking into account the short period for lecturers.

AB  - Background: Clinical Physiology Grand Rounds (CPGR) is an interactive, case-based conference for medical students designed to: (1) integrate preclinical and clinical learning; (2) promote inductive clinical reasoning; and (3) emphasise students as peer teachers. CPGR specifically encourages mixed learning level student interactions and emphasises the use of concept mapping. We describe the theoretical basis and logistical considerations for an interactive, integrative, mixed-learner environment such as CPGR. In addition, we report qualitative data regarding students' attitudes towards and perceptions of CPGR. Context: Medical students from first to fourth year participate in a monthly, interactive conference. Programme description: The CPGR was designed to bridge gaps and reinforce linkages between basic science and clinical concepts, and to incorporate interactive vertical integration between preclinical and clinical students. Medical education and content experts use Socratic, interactive teaching methods to develop real-time concept maps to emphasise the presence and importance of linkages across curricula. Programme evaluation: Student focus groups were held to assess attitudes towards and perceptions of the mixed-learner environment and concept maps in CPGR. Qualitative analyses of focus group transcripts were performed to develop themes and codes describing the students' impressions of CPGR. Discussion: CPGR is a case-based, interactive conference designed to help students gain an increased appreciation of linkages between basic science and clinical medicine concepts, and an increased awareness of clinical reasoning thought processes. Success is dependent upon explicit attention being given to goals for students' integrated learning. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2013.

AB  - The objectives of this study were (1) to determine physics student teachers' understanding of energy and related concepts and (2) to determine how they associate energy with other related concepts. Twenty six first-year physics student teachers (STs) participated in this study. STs' understanding levels were determined using a questionnaire requiring defining energy and related concepts verbally, and how they associate these concepts was determined through concept mapping. Findings revealed that the STs were not able to use their understandings they were supposed to have about the energy and related concepts while linking energy and related concepts. In the light of this study, it was concluded that students have difficulty in learning energy and related concepts in an instructional approach based on work concept. © Sila Science.

AB  - We present the results of an investigation on how well students are able to understand object-oriented programming (OOP) when learning with only very minimal guidance. We analyzed the source code that the students of a preparatory course produced during the course as well as concept maps that they were asked to draw before and after the course. Our findings show, that there are observable differences between what students know about some concepts and what they're able to do with it. Generally speaking, it seems that several OOP related concepts can be applied successfully without fully understanding the underlying concepts, while others are hard to understand and apply without a significant amount of prior knowledge. This gives rise to the suspicion that it might be possible to apply a concept without having understood it, at least with respect to some algorithmic concepts of CS. Copyright 2012 ACM.

AB  - Every human being should possess problem solving skills in order to reach one's desired goals in life. Problem solving skills become even more important when sustainable solutions are desperately needed to cope with twin problems of growing scarcity of resources and increasing populations. Practical problem solving skills, with clear economically viable, timely and implementable solutions are highly valued. Unfortunately the traditional curricula of most Universities, does not teach these skills up to the level which is desired by employers. The immediate and short term purpose of this research is to study and improve the problem solving skills of undergrad Computer Science (CS) students. In this paper, the long term objective is to learn the tools and techniques by which it can be achieved and then employ those in other disciplines also. The paper highlights three main folds of the research areas, firstly problem solving skills play a significant role in technical capabilities of people in general but more so for students studying in applied science and engineering areas, such as CS, secondly, problem solving skills can be "measured" and thirdly, problem solving skills can be improved with exercising and training. © IDOSI Publications, 2012.

AB  - This chapter compares faculty self-assessment of teaching with student opinion of instruction in an online environment, in order to determine the level of agreement between faculty self-assessment and student assessment, in areas of overall program strength and directions for individual and whole-group professional development. A faculty selfassessment of teaching inventory based on established guidelines was administered to participating faculty in the Master of Library Science program at East Carolina University, and scores were compared to students' ratings of instruction for one academic year. Scores were corrected for bias, tabulated, and Pearson correlation and t-scores were calculated. The method used produced an effective benchmarking and diagnostic tool, and indicated directions for instructional improvement. Because the study was for the express purpose of internal, formative evaluation, model data tabulations are presented as examples only. Data from the actual study are not presented. Limitations of the study are that items on student evaluation of teaching surveys may not always lend themselves to concept mapping, and that data were collected only for one academic year in a single program. The chapter contributes a method that is replicable and scalable, demonstrates that data are relatively easy to acquire, and that procedures are simple to implement, requiring only basic statistical tests and measures for analysis. Results can be interpreted and understood without extensive knowledge of quantitative methods. There are few studies that compare students teaching evaluations with faculty self-evaluations, and none that specifically address it for library and information science education programs. © 2012 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Developing requirements for software projects require shared understanding of requirements among all the team members. But in Global Software Development (GSD) this shared understanding becomes harder to achieve because of the challenges inherited in GSD; these challenges include cultural diversity, inadequate communication, Time Zone difference and improper knowledge management. By its very nature, software development consists of many knowledge management practices. One of the important needs is to study the impact of these practices on shared understanding of requirements in GSD. During three months controlled experiment in an academic setting with two groups of geographically distributed students; we studied the impact of "clear organizational structure with communicating responsibilities" a practice of Knowledge Management on shared understanding of requirements. We observed the understanding patterns of both teams by conducting multiple concept mapping exercises. This paper presents comparison of results obtained from concept mapping exercises of both development teams. These results demonstrate that how selected knowledge management practice helps to improve shared understanding of requirements among GSD team members. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this work, an intelligent online argumentation platform that detects whether the learners address the expected discussion issues is proposed. The concept maps related to the learning topics are first outlined by the instructor. After each learner issues an argument on the learning platform, a term weighting method is adopted to derive inputs parameters of a Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifier. The classifier then determines if the learners' arguments are related to the concept maps outlined by the instructor. Notably, a peer review mechanism is established in this work to improve the quality of term weighting approach. The experimental results revealed that the students in a junior high school participating in argumentation learning activities of natural science were benefited by the proposed argumentation based learning assistance platform. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - This work explores the conceptual understanding attained by students in the area of parallel computing. Parallelism is continuing to grow as an important topic area in computer engineering and computer science. Even as it increases in popularity, only a limited amount of research has been done to determine how well students construct their knowledge of the field. This work aims to begin exploring the structure of parallel computing as understood by undergraduate computer engineering students. A small group of students was selected to create concept maps that illustrate their understanding. These maps have been used in many different areas of science and engineering. The maps were then analyzed and compared to a reference concept map developed by a group of computer engineering faculty. The results of this analysis revealed that students in this sample demonstrated a limited knowledge of parallelism and concurrency through the organization of their concept maps. The analysis of the concept maps also provides evidence that there is a moderate level of understanding of the challenges to implementing and controlling concurrency. However, the linkages created in the maps reveal students' misinterpretation of the goals of exploiting parallelism. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) promises to reshape the way ocean science is conducted by providing ocean researchers with access to near real-time data, the ability to control/configure sensors and mobile assets, high-bandwidth infrastructure for images, powerful cyberinfrastructure, and data visualization and modeling tools to conduct their research. Recent advances in the delivery of web-based education, and the use of visualization technology in educational contexts, have led to the development of on-line platforms for instruction that engage students in active scientific inquiry by collecting and analyzing real world data. The OOI Education and Public Engagement (EPE) Implementing Organization will leverage these technologies for ocean education. EPE will construct a series of software tools and a web-based social network that leverages the OOI Cyberinfrastructure to support engagement of a wide range of users. These tools will enable educators and developers to enhance their undergraduate education programs and engage free choice learners using real-time and streaming data provided by the OOI. EPE will enable a new approach to oceanography research, where scientists, students and the public can explore and research the ocean in real-time from their classrooms, offices, dorm rooms, and even their homes. The face of an oceanographer will be expanded well beyond the professor at sea to to a student at home viewing and analyzing exactly the same data at exactly the same time. In addition to the OOI EPE Implementing Organization (IO), there are additional IOs supporting the OOI construction (Figure 1): Regional Scale Nodes (RSN): RSN will deploy sensors to study Hydrate Ridge, an area of massive sub-seafloor gashydrate deposits, and Axial Seamount, an active submarine volcano. Coastal and Global Scale Nodes (CGSN): CGSN will deploy a global array of moorings and underwater gliders to provide sustained, but adaptable, access to complex coastal and global systems. Cyberinfrastructure (CI): The CI will provide a common operating infrastructure connecting and coordinating the operations of the marine components with the OOI scientific and educational pursuits. Program Management Office (PMO): The OOI program is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and managed by the OOI PMO, located at the Consortium for Ocean Leadership (COL) offices in Washington, D.C. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The way teachers organize and transfer their subject matter knowledge has played a crucial role in science education. However, it seems that more attention should be paid on the forms of representation and knowledge organization of teachers that they apply for transferring their knowledge. Therefore, teachers' knowledge organization and representation forms were investigated with an emphasis on the topics of Biot- Savart law and Ampère's law. Four physics teachers of introductory-level University who used, concept cards and concept maps were interviewed, and finally an interpretative analysis was performed. The results showed teachers' knowledge organization was strongly connected only for the topic of Biot-Savart law. Moreover, descriptive and explanatory mathematical models were the most applied forms of representation that teachers used for representing their knowledge. The possibility to recognize the differences in knowledge organization and representation forms of different teachers is the first step towards developing more effective teaching and learning solution.

AB  - This study deals with the application of constructivist approach through individual and cooperative modes of spider and hierarchical concept maps to achieve meaningful learning on science concepts (e.g. acids, bases & salts, physical and chemical changes)). The main research questions were: Q (1): is there any difference in individual and cooperative modes of spider concept maps' to achieve meaningful learning in science? Q (2): is there any difference in individual and cooperative modes of hierarchical concept maps' to achieve meaningful learning in science? Q (3): out of spider and hierarchical maps, which one is more effective to achieve meaningful learning in science? Q (4): is this concept map is being applicable for constructivist approach? Sixty-four 7th grade students from an Indian elementary school participated in the study. Thirty-four and thirty participants treated through spider and hierarchical concept map approach with both cooperative and individual modes. It was an immediate and delayed test experimental design. Two teaching approaches used for two experimental groups: one based upon spider concept map approach and other was hierarchical map approach. After all, students' immediate and delayed, cooperative and individual map of both groups were scored and analyzed by using, Jena & Panda, 2009 scoring procedure. The parametric tests, such as one-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer Multiple Comparisons Test used to identify any differences between spider and hierarchical map approach, concerning cooperative and individual modes of learning. Both cooperative spider and hierarchical concept map were significantly better than individual learning in science concept. Therefore, concept map is a constructivist learning. © 2012 HKIEd APFSLT.

AB  - Research has identified the value of students constructing their own representations of science concepts using modes such as writing, diagrams, 2-D and 3-D models, images or speech to communicate meaning. "Slowmation" (abbreviated from "Slow Animation") is a simplified way for students, such as preservice teachers, to make a narrated animation using a combination of modes. In this study, 13 preservice primary teachers learned how to create a slowmation during a two-hour class in a science methods course and then created one about an allocated science topic as an assignment. The research question that guided this study was, "What are the preservice teachers' perceptions of making a slowmation and how was the science concept represented in the animation?" Data included pre and post individual interviews, concept maps constructed during the interviews and the animations as artifacts. Three case studies provide a window into the perceptions of preservice teachers making a slowmation and show how they represented their concept. Slowmation is a new form of student-generated representation which enables them to use their own technology to construct a narrated animation as a multimodal representation to explain a science concept. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Groups of children at a science museum were pre- and post-assessed with a type of concept map, known as personal meaning maps, to determine what new understandings, if any, they were gaining from participation in a series of structured hands-on activities about bones and the process of bones healing. Close examination was made regarding whether children's prior knowledge or a ceiling effect was influencing results. Children made significant gains in vocabulary and concepts related to both bones and the bone healing process. Many children also demonstrated that their comprehension moved from a novice level to a transitional level of understanding. Prior to participation, children were more uniformly unacquainted with ideas about the healing process of bones than they were about bones; this led to more consistent learning gains related to the healing process. There was some indication of a ceiling effect occurring when children revealed what they had learned about bones, but not when they revealed what they had learned about the bone healing process. Although the prior knowledge theory was not statistically supported, data did show that children with greater understanding prior to the Busy Bones Lab activities end up with correspondingly greater understanding. This suggests that addressing concepts related to bones prior to a lab experience may bring more children to a higher level of understanding before engaging in the lab experience. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Computational life sciences and informatics are inseparably intertwined and they lie at the heart of modern biology, predictive quantitative modeling and high-performance computing. Two of the applied biological disciplines that are poised to benefit from such progress are pharmacology and toxicology. This review will describe in silico chemoinformatics methods such as (quantitative) structure-activity relationship modeling and will overview how chemoinformatic technologies are considered in applied regulatory research. Given the post-genomics era and large-scale repositories of omics data that are available, this review will also address potential applications of in silico techniques in chemical genomics. Chemical genomics utilizes small molecules to explore the complex biological phenomena that may not be not amenable to straightforward genetic approach. The reader will gain the understanding that chemoinformatics stands at the interface of chemistry and biology with enabling systems for mapping, statistical modeling, pattern recognition, imaging and database tools. The great potential of these technologies to help address complex issues in the toxicological sciences is appreciated with the applied goal of the protection of public health. Published 2012.

AB  - In this study, a computerized collaborative concept-mapping approach is proposed. To evaluate the effectiveness of this innovative approach, a learning activity has been conducted on an elementary school natural science course. Two hundred and twenty fifth graders from seven classes were divided into an experimental group, in which the students learned with the proposed approach, and a control group, in which the students learned with conventional computerized concept map approach. From the experimental results, it was found that the students in the experimental group had significantly better learning achievement than those in the control group. Furthermore, the cognitive load of the experimental group students were significantly lower than the ones in the control group, implying that computerized collaborative concept-mapping approach not only reduced the cognitive load, but also improved the learning achievements of the students. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to measure the effects of higher level, inquiry-based science curricula on students at primary level in Title I schools. Approximately 3,300 K-3 students from six schools were assigned to experimental or control classes (N = 115 total) on a random basis according to class. Experimental students were exposed to concept-based science curriculum that emphasized 'deep learning' though concept mastery and investigation, whereas control classes learned science from traditional school-based curricula. Two ability measures, the Bracken Basic Concept Scale-Revised (BBCS-R, Bracken 1998) and the Naglieri Nonverbal Intelligence Test (NNAT, Naglieri 1991), were used for baseline information. Additionally, a standardized measure of student achievement in science (the MAT-8 science subtest), a standardized measure of critical thinking, and a measure for observing teachers' classroom behaviors were used to assess learning outcomes. Results indicated that all ability groups of students benefited from the science inquiry-based approach to learning that emphasized science concepts, and that there was a positive achievement effect for low socio-economic young children who were exposed to such a curriculum. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Higher professional education aims to prepare students for entering practice with an adequate theoretical body of knowledge. In constructivist programmes, authentic learning contexts and self-directed learning are assumed to support knowledge learning and the transition from education to practice. Through an in-depth exploration, this case study aimed at defining and assessing the qualities of social work students' theoretical knowledge at initial qualification. Participants were final-year bachelor's students (n = 18) in a constructivist professional programme of social work. Students' knowledge concerning a real-life practical case was elicited through an interview and a form of concept mapping. A six-step procedure was used for a qualitative appraisal of students' knowledge with the assistance of seven expert teachers. During this procedure an instrument for analysing knowledge qualities was developed, comprising 13 aspects representing four features of expert knowledge: extent, depth, structure, and critical control. Results showed that 13 students received high appraisals for their knowledge extent and depth. Only 4 students received high appraisals for knowledge structure and critical control. 5 Students who received overall lower appraisals seemed inhibited to show their knowledge qualities by preoccupations with self-concerns about their own professional role. Conclusion is that the majority of students needs more learning support for knowledge structure and critical control than offered by their constructivist programme. Further research is needed into the personal factors that influence students' theoretical knowledge learning and which knowledge qualities can be reached by young adults in a 4 year educational programme. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Most students think animals are more interesting than plants as a study topic believing that plants are inferior to animals because they are passive and unable to respond to external challenges, particularly biological invaders such as microorganisms and insect herbivores. The purpose of this study was to develop an inquiry-based learning unit, the Fighting Plant Learning Unit (FPLU), which focuses on plant defense responses to biological stimuli. The study also investigated students' perceptions of the FPLU implemented in a constructivist classroom. A total of 31 Thai science majors from grade 12 participated in this study. Multiple data-gathering techniques (quantitative and qualitative) were employed: conceptual testing, concept mapping, the Constructivist Learning Environment Survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. It was found that from their active participation, the students developed a better conceptual understanding of plant defense mechanisms. In addition, they appeared to have positive attitudes toward the FPLU as evidenced by their preference for inquiry-based teaching in a constructivist learning environment. Finally, their perspectives on and appreciation of plants as active organisms had been favorably changed by the experience. © 2011 National Science Council, Taiwan.

AB  - Due to the advancement in information and communication technology and vast varied learner group, e-learning has become popular. For achieving the adaptivity in learning, predefined concept map is used to provide proper guidance. In most of the researches, weight of concepts in each learning item is not properly considered. In this study, a three phase prerequisite concept map formulation for adaptivity is proposed. This approach is a most efficient one, since the first phase discards all the unrelated items which may distract the further analysis. Here, Norm-referencing in Item Analysis approach is used to find the item discrimination for elimination of irrelevant items. The second phase, computes all the grade association rules. The weight of concept in each learning item is considered and prerequisite concept sets are found which is not having any redundancy and cyclic in its map, thereby facilitating the next step of procedure. The final phase constructs the concept map with maximum confidence in a capable manner. Finally, the Prerequisite concept map can be used in tutoring system, thereby enhancing the adaptivity in e-learning. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Our study focuses on the correlation of concept map (CMap) structures and learning success tested with short answer tests, taking into particular account the complexity of the subject matter. Novice sixth grade students created CMaps about two subject matters of varying difficulty. The correlation of the complexity of CMaps with the post-test was small but highly significant in both subject matters. The complexity of the CMaps correlated with the long-term knowledge in the difficult subject matter but not in the context of the easy one. Furthermore, the high number of technical errors makes it close to impossible to estimate students' knowledge. In summary, CMaps do not provide an adequate alternative to conventional short answer knowledge tests, but together with them they may offer a better comprehension of a student's knowledge structure and aid in the preparation of further instruction tailored to individual needs. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Introduction: Within the framework for the long-term educational follow-up of patients with chronic disease, the methods used to identify patient educational needs are not well described. Objective: Investigate the educational advantages of using concept mapping to make decisions about the educational follow-up of patients with cardiovascular risk factors in a specific educational structure. Method: Elaboration of a concept map and negotiation of an educational contract during an interview with 16 patients. Results: Two-thirds of the needs expressed by the patients after the concept map are new compared with the expectations expressed before concept mapping. The needs of 11 patients are fully or partially similar compared with those identified by the caregiver. For 13 patients, all the needs expressed by the patients are connected with a knowledge field found in their concept map. For 14 patients, the negotiated educational contracts take into account needs expressed by the patients. Conclusion: The study shows that concept mapping might help to identify patients' educational needs as well as to negotiate a therapeutic educational contract. It allows this follow-up to meet the patient's needs and the caregiver's educational objectives. © EDP Sciences, SETE, 2012.

AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze the results of a survey on students regarding the integration of their institution's health science curriculum. Methods: One hundred and twenty five (125) students of the 5th term of the undergraduate medical course were given a questionnaire on the integration sessions. The questionnaire with a five point Likert scale, with a minimum of one and a maximum of five rating, was administered in October 2009. The data from the questionnaire was compiled and analyzed by using the SPSS version 16. Results: One hundred and twenty two students out of the one hundred and twenty five answered the questionnaire 122/125 (97.6%). The reliability of the scale was 0.50 (Cronbachs alpha -0.5). 91.8% students agreed that integrated teaching helped in the appreciation and application of the basic science knowledge to health and disease. 82% agreed that integrated teaching improved the performance in clinics and university examinations. The responses were equally distributed in favour of traditional teaching (36%) and integrated teaching (30.3%), while 33.6% responses were of indecisisive. 51.7% of the students preferred the horizontal to vertical integrated teaching. Many positive aspects were listed by the students, such as "integrated teaching improves the understanding of the topics" and a few negative remarks such as "lengthy" were mentioned. The students suggested mind mapping, concept maps and small group discussions to improve the interaction. Conclusion: The students recognized that integrating the medical subjects was useful and of interest to them, and that they should be continued.

AB  - University faculty are increasingly assuming responsibility for program assessment, with results being used in part to determine program quality. In some cases, results are being used to rationalize allocation of shrinking university resources. As a result, many faculty members are seeking simple and meaningful ways to prepare for and collect data for assessment purposes. Fashion Merchandising faculty at a medium-sized, southern university decided to experiment with concept mapping, a creative tool based on constructive learning theory, to plan for program assessment. The purpose of this paper is to explain the use of concept mapping in this context. Results show that concept maps have much to offer in assessment planning. Additional benefits of concept mapping are also discussed. © 2012 American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences.

AB  - Research apprenticeships for secondary students provide authentic contexts for learning science in which students engage in scientific investigations with practicing scientists in working laboratory groups. Student experiences in these research apprenticeships vary depending on the individual nature of the laboratory in which students have been placed. This study explores potential relationships among student experiences in apprenticeship contexts and desired student outcomes (e. g. science content knowledge, understandings of nature of science, and aspirations for science oriented career plans). The following two research questions guided the study: How do participant experiences in and outcomes resulting from an authentic research program for high school students vary? How does variation in participant experiences in an authentic research program relate to participant outcomes? Primary data sources were student and mentor interviews in addition to student generated concept maps. Results indicated that the greatest variance in student experiences existed in the categories of collaboration, epistemic involvement, and understandings of the significance of research results. The greatest variation in desired student outcomes was observed in student understandings of nature of science and in students' future science plans. Results suggested that collaboration and interest in the project were experience aspects most likely to be related to desired outcomes. Implications for the design of research apprenticeships for secondary students are discussed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Purpose: This article aims to describe the standards-based approach used to build the International Studies Research Methods (INS250) course, a discipline-specific, credit-based class taught by librarians. This writing-intensive course emphasizes information literacy and critical thinking skills, which were developed using written assignments, class presentations, multiple assessment methods, and web-based applications. Design/methodology/approach: This paper will review the literature about discipline-specific, credit-based information literacy (IL) courses and outcomes. It will also analyze the INS250 course structure and map ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education to learning outcomes for the course. Findings: The paper finds that, in the absence of discipline-specific information literacy standards, the ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education can serve as a starting point for International Studies course outcomes and assessment. Other assessment approaches, specifically student workshops and concept maps, promote student engagement and provide ample evidence of student learning. Originality/value: This article will identify research skills needed by International Studies majors and students in similar multidisciplinary programs. It will serve as a model of how to build a credit-based course with application to other fields such as political science, sustainability, human rights and international business. The course is student-focused and responsive to new disciplines and areas, with an emphasis on disciplinary databases, search skills, and citation skills. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - In the physical and natural sciences, the complexity of natural systems and their interactions is becoming better understood. With increased emphasis on learning about complex systems, students will be encountering concepts that are dynamic, ill-structured and interconnected. Concept-mapping is a method considered particularly valuable for enabling learning in subject areas that are complex or ill-structured. Evaluations of concept-mapping tend to reflect their many applications. Many evaluations that try to measure enhancements in learning use test scores or grade-point averages as performance indicators, which provide little information on how cognitive processes have developed. In this study, a modification of the Biggs and Collis' Structure of the Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy is applied to measure differences in the cognitive and structural complexity of learning outcomes between groups of students who participated in a concept-mapping activity with those from a cohort that did not. The evaluation demonstrated that the intervention was effective in enabling the great majority of students to achieve better connectivity in thinking, though improvements in overall performance were less significant. Almost all students perceived the intervention to be of value to their learning. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In physics teacher education the use of graphical knowledge representation tools like concept maps are abundantly used because they are known to support the formation of organised knowledge. It is widely assumed that certain structural characteristics of concept maps can be connected to the usefulness of content. In order to study this relationship, the concept maps made by pre-service physics teachers are examined here. The design principles of the concept maps are based on quantitative experiments and modelling as the basic procedures in physics concept formation. The epistemic plausibility of justifications written in links is evaluated by using a four-level classification introduced here. The results show that the epistemic analysis of links affects remarkably to the acceptability of knowledge. The advantages of such concept mapping technique in supporting the conceptual understanding in physics teacher education are discussed as well as their usefulness in making plans for teaching.

AB  - This phenomenographic study documented changes in student-held electrical concepts the development of meaningful learning among students with both low and high prior knowledge within a problem-based learning (PBL) undergraduate electrical engineering course. This paper reports on four subjects: two with high prior knowledge and two with low prior knowledge. Subjects were interviewed at the beginning and end of the course to document their understanding of basic electrical concepts. During the term, they were videotaped while solving problems in lab. Concept maps were generated to represent how subjects verbally connected concepts during problem-solving. Significant to PBL research, each subject's body of meaningful learning changed with each new problem, according to how the subject idiosyncratically interpreted the activity. Prior knowledge among the four subjects was a predictor of final knowledge, but not of problem-solving success. Differences in success seemed related more to mathematical ability and habits of mind. The study concluded that, depending on context, meaningful learning and habits of mind may contribute significantly to problem-solving success. The article presents a testable model of learning in PBL for further research. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The paper describes how specific descriptors for the Conservation-Restoration profession have been developed by the European Confederation of Conservator-Restorers' Organizations. The result of which is in accordance with the threefold rubric of Knowledge, Skills and Competence as defined by the European Qualifications Framework. Instead of giving a broad general description of level, which is insufficiently expressive, concept mapping has been used to explicitly uncover the topography of Knowledge, Skills and Competence required for access to the profession. The application of this method, originally developed by Novak in 1972 to enhance learning in the sciences, demonstrates that it is possible to elucidate the complex nature of such professions using such a declarative system. Its hierarchical nature and the ease with which links between different elements can be identified aid the construction of an intellectually robust framework, thereby demonstrating its appropriateness. The results suggest that access to the profession can be presented as a framework of interconnected cognitive competencies, which can be expressed as a structural process where each element possesses an individual level of skill and knowledge. © 2011 The Author(s).

AB  - This study explores the effect of multidimensional concept mapping instruction on students' learning performance in a web-based computer course. The subjects consisted of 103 fourth graders from an elementary school in central Taiwan. They were divided into three groups: multidimensional concept map (MCM) instruction group, Novak concept map (NCM) instruction group, and traditional textbook (TT) instruction group. Four weeks of experimental instructions were given to the three groups, respectively. Students' progresses were examined by pre-test and post-test measurements. The experimental results suggested that subjects in the MCM group performed significantly better than those in the NCM group which in turn performed significantly better than those in the TT group. Pedagogical implications were addressed, and conclusion and some suggestions were given. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Our contemporary society asks for new strategies to manage knowledge. The main activities developed by academics involve knowledge transmission (teaching) and production (research). Creativity and collaboration are valuable assets for establishing learning organizations in classrooms and research labs. Concept mapping is a useful graphical technique to foster some of the disciplines required to create and develop highperformance teams. The need for a linking phrase to clearly state conceptual relationships makes concept maps (Cmaps) very useful for organizing our own ideas (externalization), as well as, sharing them with other people (elicitation and consensus building). The collaborative knowledge construction (CKC) is supported by Cmaps because they improve the communication signal-to-noise ratio among participants with high information asymmetry. In other words, we can identify knowledge gaps and insightful ideas in our own Cmaps when discussing them with our counterparts. Collaboration involving low and high information asymmetry can also be explored through peer review and student-professor/advisor interactions, respectively. In conclusion, when it is used properly, concept mapping can provide a competitive advantage to produce and share knowledge in our contemporary society. To map is to know, as stated by Wandersee in 1990 [20]. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This study focuses on the competencies selecting learning strategies and applying learning strategies, which are required for successful self-regulated learning with expository texts, the spontaneous application of these two learning strategies, and their relationship to learning outcomes. The aim of the study was to evaluate new tests that assess both competencies and to analyze whether the independent assessment of both competencies can be used to identify learning deficiencies (e. g., production deficiency). The reported results are based on a sample of 559 German ninth grade high-school students. The mean age of the sample was 14.92 years (SD = 0.52) with 52.1% of the students being female. In order to initiate self-regulated learning and to assess the individual learning outcome, an expository science text was given to the students asking them to individually learn its main points. Based on a random sample of 103 students, the spontaneous use of learning strategies was recorded. In addition, the competencies selecting learning strategies and applying learning strategies (using the subordinated competencies applying the text-highlighting-strategy and applying the concept-mapping-strategy) were assessed using newly developed/adapted tests. The results of a multiple regression analysis revealed that, apart from prior knowledge, the competencies selecting learning strategies and applying the text-highlighting-strategy were predictive for students' learning outcome. Furthermore, the suitability of the new tests using the text-highlighting-strategy to identify learning deficiencies could be demonstrated. © Hogrefe Verlag Göttingen 2012.

AB  - Background: To evaluate the scientific reasoning in basic science among undergraduate medical students, we established the National Medical Science Olympiad in Iran. In this Olympiad, the drawing of a concept map was used to evaluate a student's knowledge framework; students' ability in hypothesis generation and testing were also evaluated in four different steps. All medical students were invited to participate in this program. Finally, 133 undergraduate medical students with average grades ≥ 16/20 from 45 different medical schools in Iran were selected. The program took the form of four exams: drawing a concept map (Exam I), hypothesis generation (Exam II), choosing variables based on the hypothesis (Exam III), measuring scientific thought (Exam IV). The examinees were asked to complete all examination items in their own time without using textbooks, websites, or personal consultations. Data were presented as mean ± SE of each parameter. The correlation coefficient between students' scores in each exam with the total final score and average grade was calculated using the Spearman test. Results: Out of a possible score of 200, the mean ± SE of each exam were as follows: 183.88 ± 5.590 for Exam I; 78.68 ± 9.168 for Exam II; 92.04 ± 2.503 for exam III; 106.13 ± 2.345 for Exam IV. The correlation of each exam score with the total final score was calculated, and there was a significant correlation between them (p < 0.001). The scatter plot of the data showed a linear correlation between the score for each exam and the total final score. This meant that students with a higher final score were able to perform better in each exam through having drawn up a meaningful concept map. The average grade was significantly correlated with the total final score (R = 0.770), (p < 0.001). There was also a significant correlation between each exam score and the average grade (p < 0.001). The highest correlation was observed between Exam I (R = 0.7708) and the average grade. This means students with higher average grades had better grades in each exam, especially in drawing the concept map. Conclusions: We hope that this competition will encourage medical schools to integrate theory and practice, analyze data, and read research articles. Our findings relate to a selected population, and our data may not be applicable to all medical students. Therefore, further studies are required to validate our results. © 2012 Azarpira et al.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore barriers most likely to interfere with person with diabetes’ preventive and curative behaviors with regard to their feet and to offer suggestions for patient education based on this analysis. Methods: Thirty persons with Type 2 diabetes mellitus at high risk for foot problems were interviewed. A concept map was constructed and supplemented by questions exploring disease representations, locus of control, perceived severity, perceived competence, and patient education needs. A comparative analysis was performed between two groups: seventeen patients with recurrence of foot ulcers, and 13 patients with no recurrence. Results: Patients with recurrence were more likely than those without recurrence to emphasize the negative impact of the ulcer on their daily live, their locus of control was more external than that of patients without recurrence. Patients with no recurrence demonstrated a “preventive attitude” characterized by the fact that they were more likely to emphasize preventive care on their concept maps than were patients with recurrence. They also expressed greater perceived competence in avoiding and detecting the first signs of foot ulcers than did patients with recurrence. Conclusion: Based on the observed differences between patients with and without recurrences, we propose some improvements in patient education programs, focusing more on increasing patientsâ understanding of the mechanisms of foot ulcers, helping them develop a preventive attitude, and increasing their perceived competence in avoiding ulcers. © 2012 EDP Sciences, SETE.

AB  - There are numerous challenges facing a class at university: limited access to tutorial rooms, fewer tutors and low student attendance in traditional lectures. A further challenge in science is the need to facilitate the learning—and develop the science literacy—of non-science majors, who in the case of this paper elect to study astronomy as part of their academic program. On moving a class online, the challenge includes finding, and becoming confident in using, effective methods and tools. This paper traces a process of review and collaboration between an educational development team and faculty academics to reconfigure an introductory astronomy unit. Part of the approach is to engage students using concept mapping to underpin enquiry-driven pedagogy using the university’s learning management system. © 2012 Natalie Spence, Dean Groom, Orsola de Marco, Robert Parker, Michael Ireland, Mark Wardle.

AB  - We describe development and evaluation of a learning support environment with error-based simulation functions using concept maps for class structure meaning. There are various relations between concepts in scientific domains, and understanding these relations is vital. Understanding class structure is particularly important. To that end, it is effective for learners to construct class structures by themselves. We develop a learning support environment using concept maps to aid the independent construction of structures by learners. The environment offers error-based simulation when learners make mistakes during construction. We report on implementation of the environment in a junior high school, and confirm that junior high school students can use the environment.

AB  - We have already proposed Kit-Build Concept Map (we call it as "KB map") that is a framework to realize automatic diagnosis of concept maps built by learners and to give feedback to their errors in the maps. In this paper, we report an experimental evaluation of KB map in science learning in an elementary school. Two classes of fourth grade students in an elementary school attended the experiment. "Waxing and Waning of the Moon" in science class was the topic of this experiment. The results suggested that the diagnosis and feedback with the KB map has positive effect to improve learner's understanding of this topic.

AB  - Inside the globalisation era in which society is immersed, one of the current challenges for any educational system is to provide quality education. While some countries are linguistically homogeneous, many countries and regions display a wealth of linguistic diversity and it is essential to adapt the educational system to those realities. In addition, multilingual education promotes no only social equality but also intercultural education. The development of computer software localisable not only at interface level but also regarding learning resources may help to fulfill this aim. During the lastyears a number of products have emerged to support computer-based concept mapping. This paper presents a pilot study carried out at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU i the area of database systems with three main aims: to facilitate learning abou the subject domain, to evaluate whether concept mapping is in general a good technique for learning topics in different languages, and finally, to verify whether CM-ED Concept Map EDitor provides the necessary mechanisms to fulfilthis objective. Results confirm that the use of a concept map editor is a good support for education in multilingual settings.

AB  - The deep analysis of Concept Maps (Cmaps) may reveal latent information that is not perceived from the simple reading of its propositional network. This paper proposes the Neighborhood Analysis (NeAn) as an innovative way to assess the Cmaps obtained in a classroom. The selection of a Compulsory Concept (CC) allows teachers to evaluate how the students relate it to other concepts, which are classified as Neighbor Concepts (NCs). The propositions established between the CC, and the NCs are enough to indicate the students' level of understanding on the mapped subject. Cmaps (n = 69) about climate change are the first set of empirical data that confirms the potential of NeAn. Dispersion was selected as CC in order to check whether students can relate this physical phenomenon with the global perspective of climate change. The patterns found from the NeAn suggest that, despite being exposed to the same didactic activities, some students could not use the CC properly. This may be explained from David Ausubel's learning theory, which stresses the critical role of prior knowledge in the assimilation process of new information. © Sociedade Brasileira de Física.

AB  - The PISA 2000 study found large differences between countries in terms of quality of learning. In some countries, students prefer rote learning to meaningful learning. However, such memorisation of the material does not lead to recallable and usable knowledge in the long run. Ausubel's (1968) wellknown theory serves as a basis for several techniques of meaningful learning, including concept mapping, which emphasises the visual organization of comprehended information. The present study reports the results of an experiment using concept mapping for deepening students' understanding of teaching materials. It focuses on definitions frequently used in science and Hungarian grammar lessons. Results indicate that concept mapping training programmes can improve participants' achievement. Experiences show that the technique of concept mapping is frequently unfamiliar to students. More time would be needed for practising and using it in different learning situations. © IEJEE.

AB  - Concept mapping is a technique that represents knowledge in graphs. It has been widely adopted in science education and cognitive psychology to aid learning and assessment. To realize the sequential manner in which students develop concept maps, most research relies upon human-dependent, qualitative approaches. This article proposes a method for sequential pattern analysis, inspired by sequential pattern mining algorithms generally applied to commercial forecast and decision supports. The method can be programmed for automatic execution and thus reasonably fast, yielding reproducible results. To validate the proposed method, 187 college students were recruited to create respective concept maps on a computerized concept mapping system. While the concept mapping data was analyzed by the sequential pattern analysis method, it was found that the mapping sequences used by students that created superior concept maps were similar and had a pattern in which propositions were formed in a temporal order from more inclusive to less inclusive. Conversely, no similarity was found in the concept mapping sequences by those who created inferior concept maps. The findings support theoretical expectations about concept mapping and are consistent with qualitative evidence based on student self-reports. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.

AB  - New networking technologies increase the effectiveness and the adoption of interactive tools in all education levels. Concept maps are one of the most important of these interactive tools. They have been widely used as learning and teaching tools in science education. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of web-supported concept maps (WSCMs) and classical concept maps (CCMs) on students' cognitive development and misconception changes about photosynthesis subject. The sample of this study consists of total 74 students and 2 experienced teachers in Trabzon. CCMs were transferred to the virtual environments in the form of WSCMs by authors. At the beginning, Photosynthesis achievement tests (PAT) and photosynthesis concept test (PCT) were administered as pre-tests and post-tests both to experimental group and control group. After the educational program, general science achievement on PAT increased by 10 % in favor of experimental group (EG) at significant level (p<0.05). Although the increased at knowledge level in cognitive development was 16.00 % in the EG and 16.80 % in control group (CG). These changes were 26.60 % and 18.90 % at comprehension and application levels in the EG and 10.54 %15.50 % in the CG for cognitive development, respectively. The results revealed that using WSCMs in teaching photosynthesis is very effective for students to reach comprehension level of cognitive domain. In addition, misconceptions about food, nutrition and energy sources for plants were decreased in the EG more than in the CG. © Sila Science.

AB  - Background: Concept-mapping and interview techniques are used to track knowledge and understanding over the duration of PhD study amongst four students and their supervisors in the course of full-time research towards their PhDs. This work is in contrast to much PhD supervision research and policy research that focuses on supervisory styles and roles and may decontextualise the topic and disciplinary setting.Purpose: The work investigates the understanding of the process and product in PhD-level research and supervision.Sample: Participants were four students and their supervisor(s). Case studies were based on longitudinal studies conducted over three to four years (the duration of a PhD). The students were all enrolled in lab-based PhDs in one UK-based higher education institution. Three of the four students were international (one EU-based) and three supervisors were from outside the UK.Design and methods: The data provide documentary evidence of the ways in which these supervisors act to facilitate learning and discovery of research processes and an understanding of lab-based science research supervision. In the initial interview (conducted separately with students and supervisors), the interviewee constructed two maps, one on the topic of the PhD and one on the process of a PhD. In subsequent interviews, the student or supervisor reviewed and updated the previously constructed maps. Transcripts of the interviews were made as well. These data draw on 72 interviews and 96 unique concept maps constructed. The challenges of a PhD being both a process of learning (for the student and the supervisor) and a product of a research project are explored using case study analysis of these four pairs.Findings and discussion: Analyses of the collected data suggested that the students focused more on the product of a PhD (completing a thesis and publication), whereas the supervisors concentrated on the process of learning and scientific development.Conclusions: Evidence in the study suggested product/process differences in the student and supervisor conceptualisation of the PhD. This paper offers development towards a research-led pedagogy of supervision that places the process and product of a PhD at the centre of the supervisory relationship. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Observation competence plays a fundamental role in outdoor scientific investigation. The computerized concept mapping technique as a Mindtool has shown the potential for enhancing meaningful learning in science education. The purposes of the present study are to develop a concept map integrated mobile learning design for ecology observation and to examine the implementation effect for elementary school children. Also, the difference in growth slopes between gifted and average students is investigated. Eighteen gifted students and thirty average students were included in this study. A computerized dynamic assessment system which combines a Computerized Ecology Observation Competence Assessment (CEOCA) and a concept map integrated ecology observation learning design were implemented. The results of the hierarchical linear model (HLM) analysis reveal that the overall growth slope is significant (μ=0.27, p<.01). The effect size is 0.53. The growth slope of the gifted students is a little higher than that of the average students. However, the slope difference between ability groups is not significant. The results suggest that a well designed concept map integrated learning system demonstrates very promising potential for enhancing both the gifted and average students' mobile observation competence. The system developed in this study could be a useful resource for elementary school outdoor learning design. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.

AB  - In recent years, researchers have proposed various approaches for developing adaptive learning systems based on concept maps. Nevertheless, most of them deal only with binary grades of each test item. In this paper, we present a new method to automatically construct concept maps based on fuzzy set theory that can construct concept maps based on the result of analysis of numerical testing scores. The proposed method can overcome the drawbacks of existing methods and provides a useful way to automatically concept maps in adaptive learning systems. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In fall 2010 and winter 2011, two new courses in systems thinking were initiated as core curriculum in the master's programme in Creative Sustainability at Aalto University in Finland. As intensive courses, each was to be conducted as three full days of lectures over eight days, with students fulfilling credit hour requirements both independently and in group activities over a two-to-three month period. To complement the teaching staff at the university, a researcher active in the systems science community was brought in from abroad as a subject matter expert for the two courses. In the summer preceding the first session, a reading list for the courses was drawn from current leading sources in the systems sciences, starting from 2010 and linking back to prior references of relevance. Lectures were prepared as minimal critical specifications, with concepts mapped into clusters of references, with the majority of sources available electronically over the Internet. On each set of the three lecture days, the courses were delivered in a face-to-face classroom setting, coupled with group activities designed in the style of Singerian inquiring systems. Coordinating artifacts from the instructors evolved and were incrementally updated on a publicly-accessible web site, and students followed the social media style of posting their reflections on publicly-visible weblogs linked with notifications on an activity stream at a systems community hub. Supplementing the chronological recollections of development and learning during the courses sessions, theoretical reflections constructed in hindsight may serve to inform the form and content of similar educational opportunities in other contexts. Preparations are underway as the courses are being naturally evolved for a second cohort of students in fall 2011. The completion of one cycle of two courses presents an opportunity for reflections on the approach employed in the innovation/startup cycle, with considerations for improvements and/or replication for similar programs in the future.

AB  - The paper presents a novel approach regarding adaptive and intelligent knowledge assessment using concept maps. The paper describes the knowledge assessment software system that has twofold goals in the context of the integration of technology into the traditional educational process: 1) to promote learners' knowledge self-assessment, and 2) to support the teacher in the improvement of the learning course through systematic assessment of learners' knowledge and analysis of its results. The goals are reached by the use of concept maps as an assessment tool and by providing opportunities to extend an initially created concept map for the next assessment stages and to present a learner information about his/her errors at the end of each assessment stage. The latter feature supports process oriented learning and makes the system unique among other similar systems. The system has been being developed already for 6 years by continuously improving its functionality. At the moment it offers a graphical user interface for manipulations of concept maps by the teacher and learners, the presentation of information about learners' errors, six tasks of different degrees of difficulty with adaptation of tasks' difficulty to each particular learner, an intelligent algorithm for the comparison of teacher's and learner's concept maps. In this paper the overview of the system is given specifying goals of the system, its discriminative features, the scenario of usage of the system and the results of testing the system in different study courses. © 2011 IADIS.

AB  - In order to better understand the structure of students' knowledge in computer science, we are trying to identify patterns - in form of frequently occurring subgraphs - in concept maps. Concept maps are an externalization of a person's declarative knowledge represented as a graph. We propose an algorithm that can be employed to identify frequently occurring subgraphs, based on existing algorithms in that field. We are currently working on a project that will gather concept maps form a large group of freshman in the coming semesters, providing us with extensive material for information mining about the structures of knowledge in CS. We hope to get a better understanding of the relationship between knowledge and competence.

We have been using the kit-build concept map in real class in an elementary school. This paper is a work-in-progress report of the practical use of the kit-build concept map for science learning in the elementary school. In this report, map building with tablet-PCs is mainly described. Based on the results of questionnaire, we have confirmed that the students found concept-map building useful, and preferred to use tablet-PCs rather than desk-top PCs.

AB  - Collaborative learning provides opportunities to facilitate students' knowledge construction. However, students may face challenges while constructing meaning through dialogue. This study explored multiple forms of support to foster collaboration that would lead to a deeper understanding of science ideas and high-quality group concept maps. Ninety-five students from four 8 th grade science classrooms participated in this study. Using a 2 x 2 experimental design, we examined the effect of teacher modeling of prompts and the effect of meaningful individual preparation prior to collaboration on the quality of students' concept maps. Statistical analyses revealed that groups that prepared individual concept maps and received teacher modeling of prompts generated the highest quality concept maps. Further, teacher modeling of prompts was only found to be effective when combined with the individual preparation of concept maps prior to collaboration. Implications for classroom practice and future research are discussed. © ISLS.

AB  - Textbooks often provide teachers and students a conception of how scientific knowledge is organized. Therefore, it is of interest to recognize what is the picture of knowledge conveyed by the textbooks. In this study, the knowledge organization in three university physics textbooks is analyzed from the viewpoint of how the basic elements in the topics of Biot-Savart and Ampère's law are structurally linked. The method of analysis is based on the interpretative analysis, which (a) recognizes basic elements of knowledge and (b) identifies the categories of links that connect basic elements. Concept maps are used to represent knowledge organization of textbooks. The results indicate that content knowledge of textbooks consist of somehow identical basic elements but different categories of links and thus different knowledge organizations. The possibility to recognize these differences in the curriculum materials is a first step towards developing more effective teaching and learning solutions and curriculum plans.

AB  - The processes of curricula, textbooks and student resources development have been broadly surveyed and studied while teachers' guides have received comparatively little consideration throughout recent reforms in science education. Ideal curriculum materials align instruction with the goals of reform. Well-designed teachers' guides contribute to communicating and supporting reform-based teaching. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functions and assistance that guides provide science teachers. A questionnaire was developed and administered to science teachers from a stratified sample of elementary and junior high schools in Taiwan. The findings indicated that the guides were of greater benefit to elementary school science teachers than they were to junior high teachers. These groups of teachers perceived the guides' usefulness differently, but they believed that a clear, concise presentation of the purpose, reminders, answer keys, concept maps of the main topics and learning progression provided the most helpful and preferred layout. Teachers felt that the function of a teachers' guide is to provide teaching resources rather than to guide teacher thinking. This study discusses design suggestions that can engage teacher thinking. © 2010 National Science Council, Taiwan.

AB  - Mobile and wireless communication technologies not only enable anytime and anywhere learning, but also provide the opportunity to develop learning environments that combine real-world and digital-world resources. Nevertheless, researchers have indicated that, without effective tools for helping students organize their observations in the field, the mobile learning performance could be disappointing. To cope with this problem, this study proposes an interactive concept map-oriented approach for supporting mobile learning activities. An experiment has been conducted on an elementary school natural science course to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only enhances learning attitudes, but also improves the learning achievements of the students. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Our study integrates automated natural language-oriented assessment and analysis methodologies into feasible reading comprehension tasks. With the newly developed T-MITOCAR toolset, prose text can be automatically converted into an association net which has similarities to a concept map. The "text to graph" feature of the software is based on several parsing heuristics and can be used both to assess the learner's understanding by generating graphical information from his or her text and to generate conceptual graphs from text which can be used as learning materials. In this study we investigate the effects of association nets made available to learners prior to reading. The results reveal that the automatically created graphs are highly similar to classical expert graphs. However, neither the association nets nor the expert graphs had a significant effect on learning, although the latter have been reported to have an effect in previous studies. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the development stages of the Coalitions Linking Action and Science for Prevention (CLASP) initiative of the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer to support research, practice, and policy coalitions focused on cancer and chronic disease prevention in Canada. Design: Coalitions Linking Action and Science for Prevention was implemented in 3 stages. This article describes Stage 1 that consisted of an online concept-mapping consultation process, 3 topic specific networking and consultation workshops, and 3 context-specific networking, coalition development, and planning meetings. These were all completed using a participatory engagement approach to encourage knowledge exchange across jurisdictions and sectors in Canada. Setting: Toronto, Ontario; Calgary, Alberta; Montreal, Québec; and Ottawa, Ontario. PARTICIPANTS:: More than 500 researchers, practitioners, and policy specialists were invited to take part in the first stage activities. Main outcome measures: (1) Participant-identified high-priority opportunities for strategic collaboration; (2) Cross-jurisdictional and cross-sector representation; and (3) Participant feedback on the CLASP processes and activities. Results: Participants from Stage 1 activities were distributed across all provinces/territories; 3 jurisdictional levels; and research, practice, and policy sectors. Ninety priority opportunities for strategic collaboration were identified across all 3 workshops. Participants provided detailed feedback about transparency of the RFP (Request for Proposals) application process, support needed to level the playing field for potential applicants, and valuable suggestions for the adjudication process. CONCLUSIONS:: Coalitions Linking Action and Science for Prevention engaged hundreds of research, practice, and policy experts across Canada focusing social-behavioral, clinical, and environmental and occupational opportunities for cancer and chronic disease prevention. Given the extent of expert and jurisdictional engagement, the substantial Partnership investment in a participatory engagement approach to RFP development and potential applicant response suggests that efforts to link cancer and chronic disease prevention efforts across jurisdictions and through research, practice, and policy collaboration may require this type of a priori investment in networking, communication, coordination, and collaboration. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Karpicke and Blunt (Reports, 11 February 2011, p. 772) reported that retrieval practice produces greater gains in learning than elaborative studying with concept mapping and concluded that this strategy is a powerful way to promote meaningful learning of complex concepts commonly found in science education. We question their findings on methodological and epistemological grounds.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education has become a key focus in the U.S. government's public education agenda. Many STEM degrees require the successful completion of undergraduate introductory organic chemistry (O-Chem), which is notorious for its difficulty and high attrition rate. Concept Maps (CM) have been used as a tool to improve teaching and learning by providing feedback to teacher and students. Although numerous studies have examined the use of concept maps (CMs) as an assessment tool in science classes, none to date has examined such applications of CMs in O-Chem. Furthermore, studies investigating the validity of CMs in post-secondary science courses are rare. Thus, the present study investigated the validity of CMs as an assessment tool and their diagnostic uses in O-Chem by examining the relationship between CM scores and other key performance measures in O-Chem. Results indicated that CM scores were significantly correlated with problem set scores and final course grade. In addition, a mediation analysis revealed that problem solving scores partially mediated the relationship between problem solving and final course grade, confirming the role CMs are expected to play in O-Chem achievement. Implications for using CMs as diagnostic and formative tools in instruction are discussed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.

In this paper we carry out social constructivist learning experiences using concept maps as a collaborative knowledge-sharing tool with applications in the coordination of virtual communities for learning. In our experiment, the community studies an environmental area-theoretically and in-situ, collects data from a variety of experiments and makes a representation of it. Then, they build a common concept map representing their understanding of this area using a set of tools developed ad-hoc and integrated by a metamodel wrapping approach. Finally, they complete it linking their node with the collected information as a way to organize and to navigate through the different pieces of knowledge that they have been accumulating during several fieldtrips. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Recent advances in mobile and wireless communication technologies have enabled various new learning approaches which situate students in environments that combine real-world and digital-world learning resources; moreover, students are allowed to share knowledge or experiences with others during the learning process. Although such an approach seems to be promising and innovative, researchers have indicated several problems when applying it to practical applications, in particular, the lack of proper strategies or tools to assist the students to learn collaboratively in such a learning scenario with abundant content. Students might feel interested when using the mobile devices to learn; however, without proper assistance or guidance, their learning achievements are usually disappointing. To cope with this problem, this study proposes a concept map-oriented Mindtool for collaborative ubiquitous learning. Experimental results from a natural science course in an elementary school show that this approach not only enhances learning motivation but also improves the learning achievements of the students. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - In recent years, academics and educators have begun to use software mapping tools for a number of education-related purposes. Typically, the tools are used to help impart critical and analytical skills to students, to enable students to see relationships between concepts, and also as a method of assessment. The common feature of all these tools is the use of diagrammatic relationships of various kinds in preference to written or verbal descriptions. Pictures and structured diagrams are thought to be more comprehensible than just words, and a clearer way to illustrate understanding of complex topics. Variants of these tools are available under different names: "concept mapping", "mind mapping" and "argument mapping". Sometimes these terms are used synonymously. However, as this paper will demonstrate, there are clear differences in each of these mapping tools. This paper offers an outline of the various types of tool available and their advantages and disadvantages. It argues that the choice of mapping tool largely depends on the purpose or aim for which the tool is used and that the tools may well be converging to offer educators as yet unrealised and potentially complementary functions. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Reflective learning can assist a learner's purposeful and conscious manipulation of ideas toward meaningful learning and knowledge integration. Blogs have been used to support reflection, but Blogs usually do not provide overt mechanisms for students to make connections between different parts of an experience, which is integral to reflective activity. A blogging-mapping tool was designed to support the reflective learning process. The tool allowed students to write blog posts, attach up to five keywords to each post, and link the keywords on a concept map. This study aimed to seek patterns of participants' use of the tool, including evidence of reflective learning, identified as integration between concept maps and blogs. Nine graduate students participated in the study for a semester. Data analysis included examining concept maps for knowledge integration over time. Participants' various mapping activities implied different levels of thinking. Some participants' final concept maps showed signs that they tried to integrate knowledge around the content area. Yet, the inconsistent and inconclusive patterns of participants' concept mapping activities signaled that more strategies were needed to sustain their commitment. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - We have developed Betty's Brain [1], a computer-based learning environment that employs the learning-by-teaching paradigm to foster students' acquisition of science knowledge and self-regulated learning strategies. The system provides students with opportunities for self-directed, open-ended learning in science. In this learning environment, students are given a knowledge construction task in which they teach a virtual agent by engaging in an iterative process of reading source material and structuring their knowledge in a causal concept map for a particular science domain (e.g., ecology or thermo-regulation). The agent, then, can use this map to answer questions and take quizzes. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This article introduces the concept of Personal Professional Theories to refer to knowledge development within the context of vocational education. They are personal interpretations of formal theories, work process knowledge and notions about professional attitude in a specific occupational domain, and are assumed to be frames of reference for professional experiences and guides in action simultaneously. To make detecting development in personal professional theories possible, strategies need to be validated for revealing them. Two strategies [i.e., concept mapping (CM) and a combination of CM with stimulated recall (SR)] are compared, by grading them on three aspects of adequacy (i.e., richness, coherence and content), to see which one reveals personal professional theories better. The sample consisted of 16 students of two training courses. Both strategies succeeded in revealing personal professional theories: The constructed maps displayed personal interpretations of formal theories, work process knowledge and notions about professional attitude. However, the concept maps of the combined strategy did worse on all aspects of adequacy. The CM strategy appeared better for revealing personal professional theories. Several explanations are offered, which deserve further investigation. Hence, despite the project's small scale, the outcomes provide in interesting clues to reveal personal professional theories. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The development of understanding in the discipline of security science is just beginning. As the academic research on defining the domain of security science continues, so does the development of learning security-related concepts in the understanding of the knowledge structure. This study has considered a methodology for the portrayal of knowledge structures in the domain of electronic security and its associated concepts. It seeks to examine the understanding of novice learners perceptions of electronic security concepts through the knowledge structure approach. The multi-dimensional scaling technique has been applied to dissimilarity measures on a selection of concepts from the domain of electronic security. These concepts were considered as key ideas in the learning of electronic security. The formal knowledge structure for electronic security concepts was mapped for an expert group that was most familiar with the understanding of this domain of security science. In addition, two student groups from the Singapore Institute of Technical Education participated in the study, and produced concept maps for the same electronic security concepts. The structures of the novice groups when compared to the expert group lacked the definition of clusters of related concepts, and were interpreted as lacking the understanding of experts in this knowledge domain. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

AB  - The "collage effect" occurs when participants in a collaborative learning environment post non-collaborative contributions to a shared workspace, as opposed to contributions that are co-constructive. The resulting artifacts become a collage of individual contributions that do not fully engage the participants in the collaborative learning process. Most online, asynchronous collaborative tools only allow participants to participate with textual interactions, which discourage co-construction in ways discussed in the paper. Graphical tools could provide better affordances for co-construction. HTML provides little support to represent interactive graphical elements in online environments. However, with SVG and AJAX, we can create interactive graphical tools in an online environment. Using SVG and AJAX, we implemented concept maps in an online learning environment called MapCourse. We used MapCourse in several different asynchronous online assignments in two different courses. Our analyses suggest that concept maps encourage more co-constructive contributions than wikipages. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - The development of chromatographic skills with the aim of optimization of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation requires a consolidated representation of the numerous operating parameters in relation with the separation quality factors. In this article, using various activities (concept map, involvement scheme and worksheet simulation), we describe a pedagogical sequence which modifies the organized knowledge structure of the students in relation to separation science. At the end of the sequence, students have developed their skills in chromatography, tackled computer simulation and produced their first optimisation tool. This approach can be used to discuss any problem where process optimization is required starting from a specific set of operating parameters.

AB  - A fundamental introduction to modern game theory from a mathematical viewpoint Game theory arises in almost every fact of human and inhuman interaction since oftentimes during these communications objectives are opposed or cooperation is viewed as an option. From economics and finance to biology and computer science, researchers and practitioners are often put in complex decision-making scenarios, whether they are interacting with each other or working with evolving technology and artificial intelligence. Acknowledging the role of mathematics in making logical and advantageous decisions, Game Theory: An Introduction uses modern software applications to create, analyze, and implement effective decision-making models. While most books on modern game theory are either too abstract or too applied, this book provides a balanced treatment of the subject that is both conceptual and hands-on. Game Theory introduces readers to the basic theories behind games and presents real-world examples from various fields of study such as economics, political science, military science, finance, biological science as well as general game playing. A unique feature of this book is the use of Maple to find the values and strategies of games, and in addition, it aids in the implementation of algorithms for the solution or visualization of game concepts. Maple is also utilized to facilitate a visual learning environment of game theory and acts as the primary tool for the calculation of complex non-cooperative and cooperative games. Important game theory topics are presented within the following five main areas of coverage: Two-person zero sum matrix games Nonzero sum games and the reduction to nonlinear programming Cooperative games, including discussion of both the Nucleolus concept and the Shapley value Bargaining, including threat strategies Evolutionary stable strategies and population games Although some mathematical competence is assumed, appendices are provided to act as a refresher of the basic concepts of linear algebra, probability, and statistics. Exercises are included at the end of each section along with algorithms for the solution of the games to help readers master the presented information. Also, explicit Maple and Mathematica® commands are included in the book and are available as worksheets via the book's related Web site. The use of this software allows readers to solve many more advanced and interesting games without spending time on the theory of linear and nonlinear programming or performing other complex calculations. With extensive examples illustrating game theory's wide range of relevance, this classroom-tested book is ideal for game theory courses in mathematics, engineering, operations research, computer science, and economics at the upper-undergraduate level. It is also an ideal companion for anyone who is interested in the applications of game theory. © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Educators rely heavily on learning activities that encourage elaborative studying, whereas activities that require students to practice retrieving and reconstructing knowledge are used less frequently. Here, we show that practicing retrieval produces greater gains in meaningful learning than elaborative studying with concept mapping. The advantage of retrieval practice generalized across texts identical to those commonly found in science education. The advantage of retrieval practice was observed with test questions that assessed comprehension and required students to make inferences. The advantage of retrieval practice occurred even when the criterial test involved creating concept maps. Our findings support the theory that retrieval practice enhances learning by retrieval-specific mechanisms rather than by elaborative study processes. Retrieval practice is an effective tool to promote conceptual learning about science.

AB  - The College of Technology - Computer Engineering Technology (CoT - CETE) program at the University of Houston has implemented a peer mentoring model funded through an NSF-sponsored grant supporting undergraduate STEM learning. A group of high achieving seniors were recruited to serve as mentors to students in lower-division laboratories. These mentors were expected to have a high level of technical knowledge and skill and also serve as guides and role models for their mentees. To support this process, training for the mentors was adapted from a peer-led team learning program and incorporated concept mapping as a primary pedagogical tool for increasing mentee understanding of key concepts. Over the course of a two-year implementation, mentors faced several challenges that undercut the impact of the mentoring sessions. Ultimately, faculty had to redesign the peer-mentor model to address these challenges and improve the potential efficacy of the program. This paper discusses the challenges faced by mentors and lessons learned during the project implementation. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.

Concept maps also were used to augment the National Science Foundation's (NSF) program — Full Option Science System (FOSS) for 3rd grade elementary students. We used two methods of assessment, Ruiz-Primo et al. (1997) and Novak & Gowin (1984). The results of the pre-post concept map assessment demonstrated that the students increased their content knowledge. Both the Novak and Ruiz-Primo methods showed an increase in accuracy of relationships and complexity of understanding of earth materials pre to post instruction. We also showed that the REAPS model enhanced the teacher's ability to teach the FOSS Earth Materials Unit and at the same time meet the Arizona State Standards in science and other non-science standards such as art, through model building. We concluded that to facilitate the use of concept maps in the classroom, teachers need more training and a simplified scoring system so they can easily score their students' progress when doing concept maps. From the practical point of view, we consider that more training and incorporation of practical activities is needed to prepare the students for concept mapping. Further research is needed to examine these possibilities. © 2011 A B Academic Publishers Printed in Great Britain.

AB  - At present, the training of professionals in Higher Education challenges docents to incorporate in their teaching practice, not only expertise of pure disciplinary content, it also calls for associated aptitudes of didactic knowledge to guide the disciplinary knowledge. This study intends to contribute new teaching methodologies in the form of didactic software for Histology students in the Nursing Degree program, Faculty of Health Sciences of the Universidad Autónoma De Chile. These interactive modules were created as support for traditional classes and practical steps with microscopic observation. For the development of the first module, a total of 200 images were digitalized in JPG format. From those images presentations with personal animation were realized, which were then converted to Adobe Flash Player thus creating the first software entitled "Histological Module". We incorporated functional information to the initial module of histological preparation in addition to concept maps. This innovation was particularly attractive and we decided to modify the initial software, thereby creating the second program entitled "Histo-functional Module". To compare student perception on both modules a previously validated, voluntary and anonymous opinion survey was carried out that included questions on factors related to: content, motivation, utility, quality and quantity. Responses were evaluated by Likert scale. Results objectively reflected the favorable acceptance that the histo-functional Module has had on the part of our students. This is probably the result of this software integrating knowledge of structures and their function, affording it meaning and facilitating learning as well as motivating students in the study of histology.

AB  - Using visual models is common in science and should become more common in classrooms. Our research group has developed and completed studies on the use of a visual modeling tool, the Concept Connector. This modeling tool consists of an online concept mapping Java applet that has automatic scoring functions we refer to as Robograder. The Concept Connector enables students in large introductory science courses to visualize their thinking through online model building. The Concept Connector's flexible scoring system, based on tested grading schemes as well as instructor input, has enabled >1,000 physiology students to build maps of their ideas about plant and animal physiology with the guidance of automatic and immediate online scoring of homework. Criterion concept maps developed by instructors in this project contain numerous expert-generated or "correct" propositions connecting two concept words together with a linking phrase. In this study, holistic algorithms were used to test automated methods of scoring concept maps that might work as well as a human grader. © 2011 The American Physiological Society.

AB  - This paper explores the use of a new pedagogy, the rock art stability index (RASI), to engender deeper understanding of weathering science concepts by students. Owing to its dynamic nature, RASI represents a quintessential actor network for weathering science, because it links task in the landscape with an active material practice and an alternative materialistic world-view recently called for in positivistic science, to create place. Using concept maps as an assessment tool, 571 college undergraduate students and 13 junior high school integrated science students (ages 12-13) were evaluated for increased learning potential between pre- and post-field experiences. Further, this article demonstrates that when students use RASI to learn the fundamental complex science of weathering they make in-depth connections between weathering form and process not achieved through traditional, positivistic weathering pedagogy. We argue that RASI draws upon inherent actor networks which allow students to link weathering form and process to an animate conceptualization of landscape. Conceptualizing landscape as sentient actor networks removes weathering science disciplinary connections and their inherent pedagogic practices. Our focus in this paper is not to challenge weathering ontology and epistemology, but rather to argue that there is a need for a pedagogical paradigm shift in weathering science. © The Author(s) 2010.

AB  - Many research studies have clearly demonstrated the importance of cognitive structures as the building blocks of meaningful learning and retention of instructional materials. Identifying the learners' cognitive structures will help instructors to organize materials, identify knowledge gaps, and relate new materials to existing slots or anchors within the learners' cognitive structures. The purpose of our empirical investigation is to track the development of cognitive structures over time. Accordingly, we demonstrate how various indicators derived from graph theory can be used for a precise description and analysis of cognitive structures. Our results revealed several patterns that helped us to better understand the construction and development of cognitive structures over time. We conclude by identifying applications of our approach for learning and instruction and proposing possibilities for the further development of our approach. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The handheld computer as a pedagogical tool has the capacity to enable students to demonstrate understanding through different modes of representations, for example, verbal, text, tables and graph, drawings, writing or written formulas, concept mapping and animations through Flash or Pocket Slides PowerPoint. Its impact as a motivational learning tool has been described in numerous articles. The purpose of this chapter is to describe its use as a research tool for capturing students' thinking processes as they construct representations in science and mathematics, or solve problems in these learning areas on the handheld. By using an avi-screen capture software operating in the background to do this, the research is a non-intrusive method of capturing the verbal and screen-based (visual) elements of students' thinking as they use the handhelds to complete individual or collaborative tasks. © 2011, IGI Global.

AB  - Many higher education faculty members find themselves with the opportunity or requirement to design a new course, or to redesign existing courses or programs. In such situations they have a number of options for how to proceed, but may be unaware of these options. And despite the recommendations and examples provided by organizations such as the Mathematical Association of America, we lack objective guidelines for making curricular decisions and for evaluating potential curricular changes. Additional complications are encountered in the hard sciences, where evaluation of hypotheses typically occurs only after rigorous experimentation. With many curriculum experiments resulting in ambiguous or anecdotal data or lacking data whatsoever, we are faced with making decisions under a great deal of uncertainty. In this chapter, we will discuss five models for curriculum development that are founded on different concepts of the learning experience. Each is unique in its approach and each pairs with different types of learning goals and objectives. Like all curriculum models, these are an attempt to share with students some underlying knowledge structure, a structure that is essentially a mathematical object known as a graph or network. They can be generated through a kind of mind map or concept map and possess complex inter-relations among the components which often require a three-dimensional model to fully visualize. To construct any curriculum then requires that we take this complex structure in three spatial dimensions and project it into a single temporal dimension so that students can experience the curriculum over time. This projection is not unique, except for the simplest of knowledge structures. Thus, all decisions about curriculum development become equivalent to a single geometric question: How do we choose the best projection from which to view the curriculum? An alternative approach, the one taken in this chapter, is to go beyond a fixed curriculum or static projection to expose students to a hyperlinked curriculum. Rather than hiding the complexity of knowledge and its connections to the students, the hyperlinked curriculum is generated by students under the constraints, guidance, and support of teachers and in collaboration with others. These teachers are in turn supported by each other, linked together by administrators who seek to guarantee appropriate opportunities for all learners. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Several applications of the HyLighter online social annotation system in undergraduate and graduate teacher education broaden and deepen instructional experiences for both students and the professor. Interactive reading and commentary on articles and case studies facilitate comprehension, memory and transfer as students learn from and with each other and the instructor. Collaborative concept mapping integrated with social annotation enables students to synthesize and link course concepts and materials reflecting the big picture of the course. Hypermedia-enhanced and collaboratively developed lesson plans provide an enriching, culminating, collaborative experience which integrates social annotation with course theories, online video and print resources and technology-enhanced, pedagogically sound lessons across the curriculum. These applications are conceptualized using several complementary theoretical frameworks, including Vygotsky's concept of the Zone of Proximal Development where an online collaborative environment creates a virtual learning community which provides scaffolding so that learners reach higher levels of performance. These social annotation practices promote student and teacher metacognition in addition to meaningful learning and transfer. They also enable authentic assessments of student achievement. Students' and teachers' reflections on their own and others' perspectives provide insights which improve both learning and instruction. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

AB  - Science assessment in secondary schools requires instruments and techniques that reveal the depth and complexity of students' science understandings and capabilities. Because students' knowledge, reasoning, and skills vary across science domains and contexts, assessments must encompass a range of tasks, formats, and techniques. This article focuses on six types of assessment: question-demonstration assessments, performance assessments, information technologies, conceptual inventories and item clusters, concept maps, and student notebooks. For each of these, distinctive features are outlined; example items are provided; and formative and summative uses are described where applicable. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we describe the process of creating personas to inform refinements to the design of software designed to help elementary students create concept maps of science topics they were studying. Drawing from interviews with children, parents, and teachers, the aim of these personas was to help the design team develop refinements to help children use the software effectively if it were to be assigned as homework. © ISLS.

AB  - This exploratory study examined how groups of sixth grade students worked together to create a collaborative concept map. We selected two contrasting cases based on their initial maps, one heterogeneous group with divergent maps and one homogeneous group with convergent maps. We analyzed group dialogue and collaborative and individual concept maps to understand: 1) if convergence of science ideas occurs during collaborative concept mapping and 2) how convergence or divergence during collaboration influences individual map construction. We found that collaborative concept maps facilitated greater convergence of ideas in groups with initially divergent pre individual maps. Further, the negotiation of divergent science ideas during collaboration led to gains in individual students' science understanding. Implications of findings and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Too often neglected to the detriment of therapeutic patient education (TPE), emotions occupy a fundamental place in pedagogy. They deserve to be explored more deeply. Objective: This empirical, qualitative study tests the feasibility of a new technique to elicite and highlighten emotions liked to knowledge organization. Methods: In this study, the patient creates a structure referred to as a "concept map/emotion map" (CM-EM) starting from a concept mapping activity. The emotion map is composed of symbols and colors. The technique is tested on 13 adolescents ranging from 11 to 15 year old, with a range of pathologies (cystic fibrosis, diabetes, asthma). The patients are treated in various health care facilities in the city of Nantes. The opinions of patients and observers are solicited to identify the advantages and limitations of this method. Results: The maps themselves and interviews with adolescents and caregivers show the effectiveness of the method for revealing the patients' emotions patients. We also describe its educational limitations. Conclusion: At this stage of the study, the CM-EM permits a patient to better understand the emotions evoked by his/her illness, and to communicate to the caregiver the nature and intensity of his/her emotions linked to his/her knowledge organization. In return, and this is a new hypothesis, eliciting and highlighting emotions could modify the knowledge organization. © EDP Sciences, SETE, 2010.

AB  - The aim of this study is to argue for alternative assessment methods (i.e. concept map) considering the changes in demography in higher education. In the case of school of dentistry, for example, there is an urgent call for a catalyst for new assessment methods in dental education in view of the drive to comprehensively assess professional competence to cater to the current work requirement; this quantitative study compared two different approaches to assessment following a first-year undergraduate course for dental and hygiene and therapy students. The assessment methods compared were multiple-choice questions and concept mapping. The data suggest that concept mapping can be appropriate for nontraditional students (i.e. adult learners), particularly those who already have professional experience in related practice. This is because concept mapping allows learners to locate their new knowledge in a broader social and experiential frame. The implications are discussed. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - One valuable goal of instructional technologies in K-12 education is to prepare students for future learning. Two classroom studies examined whether Teachable Agents (TA) achieves this goal. TA is an instructional technology that draws on the social metaphor of teaching a computer agent to help students learn. Students teach their agent by creating concept maps. Artificial intelligence enables TA to use the concept maps to answer questions, thereby providing interactivity, a model of thinking, and feedback. Elementary schoolchildren learning science with TA exhibited "added-value" learning that did not adversely affect the "basic-value" they gained from their regular curriculum, despite trade-offs in instructional time. Moreover, TA prepared students to learn new science content from their regular lessons, even when they were no longer using the software. © 2010 Association for Educational Communications and Technology.

AB  - The learner selects and transforms information, constructs hypotheses and makes decisions, relying on a cognitive structure that provides meaning and organization to experiences and allows the individual to go beyond. Quantitative data regarding concepts formed about global warming and ozone depletion was obtained through a questionnaire administered to 280 Maltese post-secondary students, who had already attended Environmental Science lessons. In depth group interviews were performed with four focus groups to elucidate underlying reasoning. Besides the presence of lacunae in their knowledge, the study revealed that students formulated their own logical, but sometimes incorrect, frameworks through which they could explain the issues. Concept maps elicited from the data show how students erroneously linked global warming to ozone depletion and stratospheric ozone to tropospheric ozone. Recommendations are made on how learners can think how an expert of that particular knowledge domain would think in that particular circumstance.

AB  - Introduction. We examine relationships between information literacy and information ecology with regard to conceptual innovation in information science. We aim to expand our understanding of human information behaviour and relevance assessment in the electronic environment. Method. Conceptual analysis and conceptual mapping is used and relationships of main concepts are determined in a concept map. Earlier empirical research on information behaviour styles and relevance assessment using surveys and interviews are synthesized. Analysis. Two information styles (pragmatic and analytic) are characterized. Relevance assessment in the electronic environment is analysed. Relevance is considered as part of information literacy. Examples of students' information horizons and a concept map of relevance are given. Results. Ecological dimensions of information literacy are determined at semantic (relevance), visual (information horizon, concept maps) and behavioural and social levels (information styles). A model of ecological dimensions of information literacy is outlined based on triangle of values, tools and communities. Recommendations for development of students' information literacy are presented at levels of information seeking and relevance assessment. Conclusions Implications for information literacy development in the electronic environments and for information and educational strategies are derived. Relevance assessment should be actively trained as part of information literacy and guided inquiry. Ecological dimensions of information literacy can be used in new models of e-learning and digital libraries.

AB  - Ensuring the competence of healthcare professionals' is core to undergraduate and post-graduate education. Undergraduate pharmacy students and pre-registration graduates are required to demonstrate competence at dispensing and accuracy checking medicines. However, competence differs from understanding. This study determined the competence and understanding of undergraduate students and pharmacists at accuracy checking dispensed medicines. Third year undergraduate pharmacy students and first year post-graduate diploma pharmacists participated in the study, which involved an accuracy checking task and concept mapping exercise. Participants accuracy checked eight medicines which contained 13 dispensing errors and then constructed a concept map illustrating their understanding of the accuracy checking process. The error detection rates and types of dispensing errors detected by undergraduates and pharmacists were compared using Mann-Whitney and chi-square, respectively. Statistical significance was p ≤ 0.05. Concept maps were qualitatively analysed to identify structural typologies. Forty-one undergraduates and 78 pharmacists participated in the study. Pharmacists detected significantly more dispensing errors (85%) compared to the undergraduates (77%, p ≤ 0.001). Only one undergraduate and seven pharmacists detected all dispensing errors. The majority of concept maps were chains (undergraduates = 46%, n = 19; pharmacists = 45%, n = 35) and spokes (undergraduates = 54%, n = 22; pharmacists = 54%, n = 42) indicating surface learning. One pharmacist, who detected all dispensing errors in the accuracy checking exercise, created a networked map characteristic of deep learning. Undergraduate students and pharmacists demonstrated a degree of operational competence at detecting dispensing errors without fully understanding the accuracy checking process. Accuracy checking training should be improved at undergraduate and post-graduate level so that pharmacists are equipped with the knowledge and understanding to accurately check medicines and detect dispensing errors, thereby safeguarding patient safety. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This study examines the process by which system thinking perceptions develop within the context of a water cycle curriculum. Four junior high school students undergoing an especially designed inquiry-based intervention were closely observed before, during, immediately after, and 6 years after completing a year long systems-based learning program. The employed research tools included observations, semi-structured interviews, and a number of "concept viewing" tools (drawings, concept maps, and repertory grids). Out of the data, four distinct "stories," each presenting a different way of constructing hydro system mental models, are described. The paper's main conclusion is that students develop their systems mental models and remember the learned material based on learning patterns that tend to remain unchanged over time. Consequently, in order to facilitate efficient and lasting construction of students' system models, learning experiences should harness these, and especially the meta-cognitive learning pattern, which holds special significance for constructing systems.

AB  - This case study draws attention to Pedro's story, a Grade 6 Latino teacher who, along with other grade 4-6 teachers, participated in a three-year professional development research project. By using data analyzed from multiple ethnographic interviews with teachers and students, and by drawing from the quantitative analyzes of concept map unit tests, we illustrate how Pedro's significant professional growth and his students' learning were truncated by top-down school district policies. These policies were implemented because of the punitive nature of the No Child Left Behind Act. Simply put, this case study exposes the impact of opp(reg)ressive policies on learning, that is, policies simultaneously oppressive and regressive. The critical perspective of the project, and its emphasis on assisting teachers to make their pedagogy and curriculum more culturally and socially relevant, was informed by sociotransformative constructivism (sTc). This is a theoretical framework that affords equal importance to cross-cultural education (learning about and acting on socially/culturally relevant issues) and social constructivism (learning to critically produce and consume knowledge). We hope that this case study will provide additional insights into the slow progress we continue to make in science teacher professional development and in closing the achievement gap. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This study has been conducted in Adiyaman University during 2007-2008 school year with 71 preservice social science teachers. The main purpose of this study was to investigate preservice social sciences teachers' ideas and believes about how to teach "Secularism" concept. The data was collected by using open ended questionnaires and students' written responses to the questions. The collected data were grouped into various frequencies and similar statements were gathered in the same frequency groups. Preservice teachers participated in this study stated that it is important to teach concepts by relating the subject; to use different teaching methods and techniques; to teach concepts by going from known to unknown, concrete to abstract, basic to complex, specific to general; to use concept maps. These preservice teachers also stated that they mostly prefer to teach the concept of secularism by using drama techniques. Using visual materials, concept maps and preparing tables which shows the differences between the secular and theocratic governments were some other methods mentioned by preservice teachers in their responses. This study is important regarding to identify preservice teachers' ideas about concept teaching and teaching secularism concept.

AB  - For beginning teachers to make the transition to full professional membership they need to increase their professional knowledge of the art and science of teaching. This paper explores the difference in knowledge growth between beginning teachers who commence teaching in fragmented teaching situations in the first two years of teaching, and their colleagues who have stable, secure and continuing employment during this time. This paper argues that the employment context in which beginning teachers take up their profession has a significant, but hitherto largely unacknowledged, effect on the capacity of teachers to develop the craft of teaching (Elbaz, 1983); on their continuing commitment to the profession; and on their self-confidence and self-image as teachers It is concluded that long-term, secure employment in one school, with full responsibility for a class of students and access to effective mentoring, is necessary if beginning teachers are to move beyond 'survival' to developing competency in the first two years of teaching. © 2010 Australian Teacher Education Association.

AB  - University teaching deals with complex and miscellaneous knowledge and higher education should focus on sustained conceptual understanding of relevant topics. Guidance on how to construct adequate knowledge structures can support meaningful learning. But lectures, for instance, often are structured in linear sequence by a number of slides and are thus biased towards linear representations of knowledge that are not appropriate for most scientific disciplines. In this study, a framework for concept maps was developed to complement lectures in human biology online. The course was aimed at student teachers at the undergraduate level. The work is based on recent theoretical research on the use of multimedia in learning environments and e-learning, knowledge structures perspectives of teaching and learning as well as theoretical assumptions of self-determination in educational processes. Each session (14 in total, e.g. human respiratory and circulatory system, physiology of senses, human anatomy) was supplemented by a digital concept map providing relevant concepts connected with linking words and continuative material attached via hyperlinks (e.g. images, web links, animations, video). Following each single lecture, students had free access to the concept maps to reinforce the latest topics and to prepare for the final examination. The objective of the study was to examine if the use of complementary concept maps (i) influences achievement and (ii) motivational variables. The students' (N = 171) concept map use was logged along with a documentation of their achievement and miscellaneous variables regarding their motivation (e.g. interest/ enjoyment, perceived competence, effort/ importance, value/ usefulness). The logfile-data allowed distinguishing learners according to the frequency and duration of their concept map use. Additionally, computer-related self-efficacy was documented as a moderating factor. Results reveal the benefit of additional concept maps for achievement and positive motivational aspects, moderating factors are discussed. The emphasize of further research should be on students' active engagement in structuring their individual learning by constructing adequate concept maps themselves, especially in science education courses. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of concept maps (CMs) as an evaluation tool of students' learning was explored during the Natural Science course assigned to all 1st-year higher education students at School of Arts, Sciences and Humanities (University of S̃ao Paulo). The richness and diversity of propositional networks produced by the students made the assessment task more complex than the evaluation of multiple-choice tests or open questions. A procedure for comparing the evaluation made by the professor (P), three experts in CMs (E) and the students (S) was used to appraise a set of CMs (n = 109). CMs' focal question explored the conceptual relationships among astronomic observations made during the 16th century, the birth of modern science and, the increase of our understanding about the universe. Correlation graphs were plotted to compare these evaluations in pairs (PxE, PxS and ExS). The results confirmed the complexity of the MCs evaluation, which asks for changing the procedures frequently used in the classroom. The possibility of including the students in the evaluation process is confirmed by the correlation found between the assessments made by them and the professor. © by the Sociedade Brasileira de Física.

AB  - Abstract The process of transforming students from novices into experts relies on active learning and the development of an appreciation for the links among topics. Since rote or stimulus-response learning is preferred by a majority of students who are beginning their programs of study but does not optimize learning and understanding, the first step in the process is changing students' preference to active learning. As students progress from 100- to 400-level courses, this outcome can be accomplished by reducing the amount of class time that instructors dedicate to lectures that introduce new material and increasing the amount of time dedicated to active learning strategies. Because of PowerPoint's linear structure, teachers can foster learning by supplementing traditional slides with tables, charts, graphs, and concept maps that explicate the links among topics. Concept maps also lend themselves to assessing students' mastery of concepts and the value added by class discussions. Both measures enable instructors to enhance their teaching effectiveness and, over time, use class sessions more efficiently. Copyright © American Political Science Association 2010.

The learning outcomes of biology students who summarised by collaborative concept mapping were compared with those of students who summarised by collaborative writing. Learning groups randomly assigned to construct concept maps instead of conventional summaries generated more relations in the summary task and their members obtained higher individual scores on a post-test. The concept mapping strategy was found to be advantageous only for students whose cognitive ability was below the median for the sample and who were placed in groups with other students having low cognitive ability. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this article, I argue for the importance of using specific kinds of concept maps, such as ladders, in a technical writing class offered for computer science majors. This article presents a strong argument that use of concept maps should be effectively integrated both during planning stages and as part of traditional document production techniques. Assignments and activities in a technical writing classroom should address the use of concept maps for conceptualizing, schematizing and presenting procedural information like software documentation, explaining laboratory reports etc. Using concept maps efficiently can lead to structural and functional conceptualization, visualization, representation and retention of complex information. A survey-based study reported in this article suggests that advanced students in an EFL technical thesis writing course in this computer science institute has enough expertise to understand the use and application of specialized concept maps for technical document production activities. Results indicate that students, on most part, understand specialized document-specific, task-specific applications and especially specific sentences in the domain of computer science and self-reports also indicate that they are reasonably confident about their ability to apply ladders in logical ways. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Although concept maps have been found to be effective in science education research, these are critiqued for being informal due to informal usage of relation and attribute names thereby resulting in ambiguity. Refined concept mapping, a development over the regular concept mapping is an approach towards introducing rigor and parsimony in representing knowledge. The method proposed suggests to substitute the ambiguous relation names with well-defined relation names to concepts consistently while mapping a domain. We suggest the use of this method for introducing rigor in concept mapping and position it among the other models of knowledge representation in an inverse semantic spectrum. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This paper seeks to develop a methodology that will discover, specify and measure students' abilities and skills in creating concept maps. Because competencies are the key factor in higher education, the paper analyzes the role of concept maps as a tool to diagnose and improve information analysis, synthesis, organization and representation skills and competencies. We propose a methodology that enables these skills to be evaluated by observing, analyzing and measuring the stages involved in creating a concept map: identification of the main and secondary subjects; subject codification by concepts; grading of concepts; and representation of the concepts and their relationships with labels. A case study using action research methodology tests its usefulness on a group of university students of library and information science. The method proposed provides information on the strengths and weaknesses of the students' skills, thus enabling their training to be improved by means of specific actions. © The Author(s), 2010.

AB  - Motivated by a long-term goal in education for measuring Taiwanese civic scientific literacy in media (SLiM), this work reports the detailed techniques to efficiently mine a concept map from 2 years of Chinese news articles (901,446 in total) for SLiM instrument development. From the Chinese news stories, key terms (important words or phrases), known or new to existing lexicons, were first extracted by a simple, yet effective, rule-based algorithm. They were subjected to an association analysis based on their co-occurrence in sentences to reveal their term-to-term relationship. A given list of 3657 index terms from science textbooks were then matched against the term association network. The resulting term network (including 95 scientific terms) was visualized in a concept map to scaffold the instrument developers. When developing an item, the linked term pair not only suggests the topic for the item due to the clear context being mutually reinforced by each other, but also the content itself because of the rich background provided by the recurrent snippets in which they co-occur. In this way, the resulting instrument (comprised of 50 items) reflect the scientific knowledge revealed in the daily news stories, meeting the goal for measuring civic scientific literacy in media. In addition, the concept map mined from the texts served as a convenient tool for item classification, developer collaboration, and expert review and discussion. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper reports a study to investigate the effects of collaborative concept mapping of a 1:1 (one-device-per-student) digital learning environment, comparing with a1:m (one-device-to-many-students) environment in terms of three aspects: students' overall learning gains, knowledge retention and quality of the concept maps. Participants were 6th-grade students from an elementary school. Guided by the methodology of quasi-experimental research, we adopted Group Scribbles (GS) 1.0 in our empirical study. We evaluated these two settings in the Social Studies course, assessing the quality of the collaboratively constructed concept maps and students' learning attitudes. The results indicated that although little difference in the concept map scores between students engaged in the two settings was found, the standard deviations of the 1:1 groups had been greater than those of the 1:m groups. According to our analysis, the reason of the greater differences in the performances among individual 1:1 group members would be that the levels of group bonding had a greater influence on the effectiveness of their collaborations. Due to space limitations, the interviews and questionnaires data will not present in this paper. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop a Computerized Ecology Observation Competence Assessment (CEOCA) to investigate the characteristics of students' observation competence. The authors assume that the students' observation competence can be enriched by meaningful experiences and the performance is situated in specific content or context. The facets included in CEOCA are knowledge, observation (on multi-media), concept mapping of wetland ecology. A total of 454 6th, and 7th graders were sampled in this study. The average difficulty (p value) is.62 for the sample. The correlation coefficients between CEOCA and related variables such as school math or science score are around.46 to.54. The pattern of correlation coefficients demonstrates sensible supporting evidences for the convergent and discriminant validity. The implications for further researches are also discussed.

AB  - For collaboration in learning situations, it is important to know what the collaborators know. However, developing such knowledge is difficult, especially for newly formed groups participating in a computer-supported collaboration. The solution for this problem described in this paper is to provide to group members access to the knowledge structures and the information resources of their collaboration partners in the form of digital concept maps. In an empirical study, 20 triads having access to such maps and 20 triads collaborating without such maps are compared regarding their group performance in problem-solving tasks. Results showed that the triads being provided with such concept maps acquired more knowledge about the others' knowledge structures and information, focused while collaborating mainly on problem-relevant information, and therefore, solved the problems faster and more often correctly, compared to triads with no access to their collaborators' maps. © 2010 International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc.; Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.

AB  - This paper explores conceptual variation in the depiction of gene function in upper secondary school textbooks. Historically, concepts in genetics have developed in various scientific frameworks, which has led to a level of incommensurability as concepts have changed over time within their respective frameworks. Since students may have difficulties in understanding concepts where there is implicit variation in descriptions of the same phenomena, we have developed a concept mapping instrument and applied it to study the gene function concepts in biology and chemistry textbooks that are widely used in Sweden, and others used in a selection of English speaking countries. The data were then further examined using content analysis. In the present paper we describe the conceptual variation of gene function as it is presented in the textbooks, and analyze the ways in which students' understanding may be influenced. We conclude that it may be difficult for students to gain a modern, process-oriented understanding of gene function if textbooks are used as foundations for the planning and execution of lessons. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - In computer science, students could benefit from exposure to critical programming concepts from multiple perspectives. Peer review is one method to allow students to experience authentic uses of the concepts in a non-programming manner. In this work, we examine the use of the peer review process in early, object-oriented, computer science courses as a way to develop the reviewers' knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts, specifically Abstraction, Decomposition, and Encapsulation. To study these ideas, we used peer review exercises in two CS2 classes at local universities over the course of a semester. Using three groups (one reviewing their peers, one reviewing the instructor, and one completing small design or coding exercises), we measured the students' conceptual understanding throughout the semester with concept maps and the reviews they completed. We found that reviewing helped students learn Decomposition, especially those reviewing the instructor's programs. Overall, peer reviews are a valuable method for teaching Decomposition to CS2 students and can be used as an alternative way to learn object-oriented programming concepts. Copyright 2010 ACM.

AB  - Aim: This article is intended to be a layman introduction to the methodology commonly used in complexity science studies, emphasizes holistic consideration, description on the entire pattern against bits and pieces of sectional analysis, use of metaphors to build up integration of ostensibly incompatible features such as simultaneous co-existence of land and rivers, hills and valleys in the landscape portraits, a popular tool in complexity studies. The setting of analysis used in this article falls in the arena of recent hot debate on how curriculum on Sustainable Development Education should be designed, a vehicle to illustrate application of Dynamical Systems Theory. Background: Curriculum re-engineering has been around for decades throughout the world; school-based curricula, innovative central curricula, inter-disciplinary projects, to name but a few. Some did not last long because of territorial biases; some made a fad and faded. The irony lay in the immediate demise of projects that claimed a success in their pilot run. We had topics like environment conservation, globalization, followed by global warming infiltrating the classrooms these past years. Now the limelight is on sustainable development. Is it late? That is not the issue. Our main concern is how our innovations may stand out against all odds and survive the times. Discussion: This article depicts application of Chaos theory, Complexity theories and Dynamical Systems Theory to understand how new trades, new academic subjects or new research interests arise and go, and argues that design for sustainable development education should embrace new elements of skills in its curriculum, and has to be inter-disciplinary. The author further argues for inclusion of complexity science elements (a series of superficially independent incidents may attenuate and demise or else, amplify through positive feedback mechanism and surprise the world with revolutionary change). However, the change could never be explained completely without an introduction of time element into the chain of change episodes.

AB  - Our study monitored the cognitive and motivational effects within different educational instruction schemes: On the one hand, teacher-centred versus hands-on instruction; on the other hand, handson instruction with and without a knowledge consolidation phase (concept mapping). All the instructions dealt with the same content. For all participants, the hands-on approach as well as the concept mapping adaptation were totally new. Our hands-on approach followed instruction based on "learning at work stations". A total of 397 high-achieving fifth graders participated in our study. We used a pre-test, post-test, retention test design both to detect students' short-term learning success and long-term learning success, and to document their decrease rates of newly acquired knowledge. Additionally, we monitored intrinsic motivation. Although the teacher-centred approach provided higher short-term learning success, hands-on instruction resulted in relatively lower decrease rates. However, after six weeks, all students reached similar levels of newly acquired knowledge. Nevertheless, concept mapping as a knowledge consolidation phase positively affected short-term increase in knowledge. Regularly placed in instruction, it might increase long-term retention rates. Scores of interest, perceived competence and perceived choice were very high in all the instructional schemes. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This study aimed to determine how 33 urban 5th grade students' science conceptions changed during a place-based inquiry unit on watersheds. Research on watershed and place-based education was used as a framework to guide the teaching of the unit as well as the research study. A teacher-researcher designed the curriculum, taught the unit and conducted the research using qualitative data sources such as concept maps, science notebooks and interviews. Most students came to understand that their watershed was part of an urban environment where water drains from the surrounding land into a body of water. Thus, they began to understand how urban land use affects water quality. This study provides evidence for the use of place-based learning in developing students' knowledge of the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996) and watersheds. Implications of this study include the use of place-based learning in urban settings and the experiences needed for students to conceptualize watersheds. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Scientific literacy can be considered as a new demand of post-industrial society. It seems necessary in order to foster education for sustainability throughout students' academic careers. Universities striving to teach sustainability are being challenged to integrate a holistic perspective into a traditional undergraduate curriculum, which aims at specialization. This new integrative, inter- and transdisciplinary epistemological approach is necessary to cultivate autonomous citizenship, i.e., that each citizen be prepared to understand and participate in discussions about the complex contemporary issues posed by post-industrial society. This paper presents an epistemological framework to show the role of scientific literacy in fostering education for sustainability. We present a set of 26 collaborative concept maps (CCmaps) in order to illustrate an instance of theory becoming practice. During a required course for first-year undergraduate students (ACH 0011, Natural Sciences), climate change was presented and discussed in broad perspective by using CCmaps. We present students' CCmaps to show how they use concepts from quantitative and literacy disciplines to deal with the challenges posed by the need of achieving a sustainable development. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Concept mapping is a technique used to provide a visual representation of an individual's ideas about a concept or set of related concepts. This paper describes a concept mapping tool using a photograph association technique (CoMPAT) that is considered to be a novel way of eliciting children's ideas. What children at 11 years of age know about particular concepts related to microbial activity is presented and discussed in relation to the effectiveness of CoMPAT as a tool to draw out their ideas. It is proposed that this tool could be used to explore ideas about this and other science concepts from children in other age groups, and where language may be a barrier to participation. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The understanding of complex physiological processes requires information from many different areas of knowledge. To meet this interdisciplinary scenario, the ability of integrating and articulating information is demanded. The difficulty of such approach arises because, more often than not, information is fragmented through under graduation education in Health Sciences. Shifting from a fragmentary and deep view of many topics to joining them horizontally in a global view is not a trivial task for teachers to implement. To attain that objective we proposed a course herein described Biochemistry of the envenomation response aimed at integrating previous contents of Health Sciences courses, following international recommendations of interdisciplinary model. The contents were organized by modules with increasing topic complexity. The full understanding of the envenoming pathophysiology of each module would be attained by the integration of knowledge from different disciplines. Active-learning strategy was employed focusing concept map drawing. Evaluation was obtained by a 30-item Likert-type survey answered by ninety students; 84% of the students considered that the number of relations that they were able to establish as seen by concept maps increased throughout the course. Similarly, 98% considered that both the theme and the strategy adopted in the course contributed to develop an interdisciplinary view.

AB  - This study (1) explores the effectiveness of the contextualized history of science on student learning of nature of science (NOS) and genetics content knowledge (GCK), especially interrelationships among various genetics concepts, in high school biology classrooms; (2) provides an exemplar for teachers on how to utilize history of science in genetics instruction; and (3) suggests a modified concept mapping assessment tool for both NOS and GCK. A quasi-experimental control group research design was utilized with pretests, posttests, and delayed posttests, combining qualitative data and quantitative data. The experimental group was taught with historical curricular lessons, while the control group was taught with non-historical curricular lessons. The results indicated that students in the experimental group developed better understanding in targeted aspects of NOS immediately after the intervention and retained their learning 2 months after the intervention. Both groups developed similar genetics knowledge in the posttest, and revealed a slight decay in their understanding in the delayed posttest. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

AB  - Concept mapping is discussed as a means to promote meaningful learning and in particular progress in reading comprehension skills. Its increasing implementation necessitates the acquisition of adequate knowledge about frequent errors in order to make available an effective introduction to the new learning method. To analyse causes of errors, 283 A-level sixth graders produced concept maps about two differently complex subject matter lessons, we implemented in a pre-lesson. We defined six types of errors and analysed the distribution and contingency tables in both subject matters. Students in general produced more complex concept maps in the context of the easier subject matter (A) than that of the difficult content (B). Whereas in the former errors simply indicated knowledge gaps, in the latter they often reflected technical misconceptions. The occurrence of a content-dependent technical error in (B) pointed to a cognitive overload, since the more difficult content is hypothesised to cause higher intrinsic load. From this following, concept mapping could provoke an instructional enrichment by additionally revealing specific knowledge gaps. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This study describes how a group of grade 7 and 8 students in South Africa engaged with the notion of spatial scale in the Universe before, during and after a visit to an astronomy science centre. A limited amount of research has been conducted on this concept worldwide. Using a combination of concept maps, observations and interviews, results indicate that, despite contrary suggestions in the literature, students aged 13- to 15-years are able to improve their conceptions of size and distance from naïve and conflicting knowledge to a more scientific understanding after their visit. The findings also demonstrate, using a human constructivist framework, that students showed both weak and strong restructuring of knowledge. Experiences with size and distance also appeared to be important in the students' affective domain. The paper argues that a combination of related, themed experiences related to spatial scale can account for the improvement, and recommends that these and even more innovative activities should be explicitly promoted at science centres and in out-of-classroom activities. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Nanotechnology has emerged in the engineering education of universities, and increased the students' difficulties in understanding and learning it. Concept mapping as a metacognitive tool may be appropriate for students to learn nanotechnology because previous research has confirmed that this tool helps students learn disciplines like chemistry, physics, biology and materials science. The current study used both quantitative and qualitative survey data to examine whether concept mapping as a metacognitive tool helps students learn nanotechnology, and to investigate the correlation between the students' perceptions of concept mapping and their metacognition abilities. The quantitative data consisted of 42 five-point Likert scale questions measuring students' perceptions of concept mapping and metacognition abilities with high reliability of the measurement. The qualitative data involved in-depth and semi-structured interviews to explore more detailed students' experience and perceptions in terms of how and why. The findings show that there is a significant positive relationship between students' positive evaluation of concept mapping and their metacognition. Students agreed that concept mapping was helpful in generating and clarifying the key concepts of nanotechnology, beneficial to guide the topic concept, and forming a more systematic knowledge structure through integrating prior knowledge and new knowledge. During the learning process of concept mapping, learners adopted a great quantity of metacognition behavior to examine and reflect the self-developed knowledge structure. The study concluded that concept mapping as a metacognitive tool was able to facilitate students to achieve high-level performance in the learning of nanometer knowledge. Future studies should further explore the interrelationships among concept mapping, metacognitive and knowledge transfer.

AB  - Secondary science methods courses provide preservice science teachers with the opportunity to learn content the way that science should be taught. A strategy for science teacher educators is to incorporate content that is unfamiliar to the students so that learning is authentic. In this chapter, we describe how to use regional environmental questions to model concept mapping for content learning and collaborative learning. We selected environmental questions that were familiar to students and relevant to their daily lives. We challenged our preservice teachers to apply their science content knowledge as we asked them to develop a concept map to include interdisciplinary science content to address our questions. This project promoted learning of the interdisciplinary nature of science, used concept mapping to develop a secondary science teacher education curriculum that promoted environmental education, and took advantage of concept mapping activities for collaborative learning while integrating discipline-specific content standards. Secondary teaching is a complex act that requires expertise in several different knowledge bases. Content knowledge, time, materials, and equipment management, learning and motivation theory, interpersonal relations, and educational policy and law are a few areas that great teachers know. Logically, one or two science content methods courses are inadequate to completely prepare science teachers to be effective for the real world of teaching. Science methods course instructors face the difficult task of selecting content and learning experiences that will provide the most value in producing master teachers. We are fortunate at our university to have two secondary science methods courses; the course described in this book chapter is not only focused primarily on lab-based science teaching but also includes safety, formative assessment, and field-based science teaching. It is also the only course in which students have significant exposure to educational technology. The primary goal for this course is to promote theory-and research-based science teaching practice. A continuous concern expressed in the literature about teacher education is the gap between recommended or research-based teaching methods and practice (e.g., Broekkamp and van Hout-Wolters 2007; Brouwer and Korthagen 2005; Zeichner and Tabachnick 1981). Science methods classes provide an ideal setting for addressing this gap. Science teacher educators have developed several strategies for trying to narrow this gap in science methods classes by producing teachers who will utilize highly effective teaching strategies rather than regressing to the unproven but familiar traditional pedagogy of transmitting information. These strategies include modeling effective practice (Hubbard and Abell 2005), demonstration lessons (Luft and Pizzini 1998), and including intensive field experiences (Penick and Yager 1988). In this chapter, we present another instructional approach of effective science teaching in the 21st century. We describe a project we have developed to make lessons learned in science methods courses more meaningful and more educative with regard to both how to teach (pedagogy) and what to teach (content). In this chapter, we present our rationale for initiating this project, the implementation with our secondary students, and some student outcomes and what we learned. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The focus of this chapter is a role-play simulation unit within a college-level interdisciplinary science elective course for preservice teachers. The simulation utilized a United States Senate Subcommittee hearing to explore the use of Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) genes in corn. Over an extended time period, students explored the material in depth, which incorporated a wide variety of teaching strategies and topics of current interest in science education (simulations, role-playing, driving questions, oral presentations, technology integration, portfolios, reflection, and concept mapping). The results demonstrated that this type of learning experience can significantly impact students' understanding of how science is applied to environmental problems. Furthermore, students developed a greater appreciation of the importance of examining the scientific, social, political, economic, and ethical dimensions of environmental issues. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

After each group of students studied the case, students were asked to search for more information on local water resources, water quality, and comparative quality of water. A local sage was invited to give a talk to the students who later used the knowledge gained to discuss the way to solve the case problems. Students reported their ideas to friends as well as constructed their own webblog to present what they had learned. Students' presentation, report, webblog, concept map, pre-post test, and observation were used to assess their achievements from this lesson. The average score was 75.38 from 100 points indicating that most students achieved the objectives of the lesson. They could build knowledge from the case, search for information on their own, and discuss with friends as well as present the understanding via the webblog. Some problems still need to be solved such as allowing for more time and providing computer each for the student who did not own one. © Common Ground, Jongdee To-im, Chakpet Tianchai, Nantawadee Tianchai, Watcharee Ketpichainarong, Piyachat Jittam, Namkang Sriwattanarothai, Pintip Ruenwongsa.

AB  - An increasing number of educational institutions and organizations around the world employ online training to address emerging challenges in teacher competence. Research literature, however, showed that few studies have been conducted that followed teachers in their respective schools after training to evaluate their classroom performance. Enthused by this lack of empirical proof, this study was conducted to assess the modifications on pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) - an accepted construct in educational lexicon - of nine non-major science teachers who were given a month-long, fully online training. Using a multi-method assessment procedure (e.g., achievement testing, concept mapping, lesson planning, and demonstration teaching), results disclose substantial alteration in two knowledge-based PCK components in science teaching - knowledge about science curriculum and students' understanding of science. A significant increase in achievement scores, better concept map structure and corrected misconceptions were observed after the training. Contrastingly, only little improvement was noted in the other two skill-based components - knowledge about instructional strategies and assessment in science. Few changes were noticed in teachers' topic-specific strategies and science learning assessment skills. Based on these findings, it appeared that fully online teacher trainings were insufficient in enhancing all facets of the complex nature of science teaching. © 2010 De La Salle University, Philippines.

AB  - At the microscopic level, there are many concepts that appear too complicated to all grades of students; especially those concerning chemical reactions. Most students have difficulty in imagining things and understanding the relevant concepts. In science, activity-based learning is deemed an appropriate method to improve students' understanding of complicated concepts. The purpose of this study was to develop an inquiry-based learning unit on chemical reaction for grade eight students by using a newly developed activity called "Tapioca Bomb" for demonstrating concepts of chemical reaction. The students had opportunities to investigate by hands-on and mind-on activities. After observing the explosion in the Tapioca Bomb activity, the students were able to build their own concepts on chemical reaction and connect science learning to everyday life. The students could explain how and why the reaction occurred, and could apply their preliminary knowledge to design their own experiment. Finally, the teacher and students discussed what they had learned and applied the knowledge gained. The results on pre-test and post-test, concept map, students' documents, CLES questionnaire and interviews indicated that this learning unit helped students conceptualize the knowledge on combustion chemical reaction. © Common Ground, Wasana Keeratichamroen, Precharn Dechsri, Bhinyo Panijpan, Pintip Ruenwongsa.

AB  - The system of natural language enables members of human species to externalize and exchange thoughts within the social group, and through the intervention of writing system. The human language system has generative power which, according to the Cognitive Architectural Model, rests on its tripartite architecture. In this architecture, there lies language-relevant information in, at least, three specific distinct representational formats: the meaning; the syntax; and the sound structures of words and utterances. In this paper, the Levelt and Reolofs Cognitive Architectural model is examined, and attempts are made to apply it to the learning and teaching of English for Science and Technology (EST). It is discovered that the cognitive machinery of language embodies both production and comprehension which instantiates a continuous internal dialogue between the instructor and the learner. It equally recognises that the Model significantly factors in and showcases a feedforward process and a spreading-activation of principles of lemma retrieval in speaking which are well-established in Stimulus-Response Approach thus giving room for Feedback. This paper, however, criticises the theory of isolating speaking single words as emphasized by the model without references to explicit explanations and integration of other language skills such as listening, reading and writing, and predicts that such practice is bound to fail in pedagogical situations. The paper recommends, among others, that the Model should incorporate continued discourse in order to meet the English language requirements of learners of science and technology. To successfully apply the Model, the paper also recommends the use of inquiry teaching and learning approach and concept-mapping strategy simultaneously. © Common Ground, Sunday Adejimola Amuseghan.

AB  - This paper discusses how techniques for representing knowledge, such as concept maps could be effectively used in a technical writing classroom for the conceptual understanding of a problem and as a visualization strategy for complex technical documents. The motivation behind using the knowledge models (concept maps) for an engineering/computer science oriented technical writing class is based on the importance of understanding different knowledge representations in an engineering / Computer Science document and the fact that the ease of solving such a problem is almost completely determined by ways in which problem is conceptualized and represented. In this project, we argue for the importance of using specific kinds of concept maps, such as ladders, in a technical writing class offered for computer science majors. A survey-based study with 25 students from a technical thesis writing class, reported in this article suggested that advanced students in an EFL technical thesis writing course have enough expertise to understand the use and application of specialized concept maps for technical document production activities. Results indicate that students, on most part, understand specific inference-based applications of concept maps in documents, tasks and especially specific sentences in the domain of computer science. Self-reports also indicated that students are reasonably confident about their ability to apply different types of concept maps in logical ways. Teaching evidence suggested that use of concept maps should be effectively integrated both during planning stages and as part of traditional document production techniques. Assignments and activities in a technical writing classroom (e.g., software manual design, quick guides, FAQ, brochures, lab reports etc) should address the use of concept maps for conceptualizing, schematizing and presenting procedural information logically and structurally. Using concept maps efficiently can lead to structural and functional conceptualization, visualization, representation and retention of complex information. The entire English curriculum in this institute designed as "English for computer science" involved students using concept maps from freshman to senior years for conceptualizing and articulating computer science concepts. © Common Ground, Debopriyo Roy.

AB  - Knowledge structures are often represented in the form of networks or maps of concepts. The coherence and connectivity of such knowledge representations is known to be closely related to knowledge production, acquisition and processing. In this study we use network theory in making the clustering and cohesion of concept maps measurable, and show how the distribution of these properties can be interpreted through the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) method. This approach allows to introduce new concepts of the "energy of cognitive load" and the "entropy of knowledge organization" to describe the organization of knowledge in the concept maps. © 2010.

AB  - Acquisition of conceptual knowledge is a central aim in science education. In this study we monitored an interdisciplinary hypermedia assisted learning unit on hibernation and thermodynamics based on cooperative learning. We used concept mapping for the assessment, applying a pre-test/post-test design. In our study, 106 9th graders cooperated by working in pairs (n = 53) for six lessons. As an interdisciplinary learning activity in such complex knowledge domains has to combine many different aspects, we focused on long-term knowledge. Learners working cooperatively in dyads constructed computer-supported concept maps which were analysed by specific software. The data analysis encompassed structural aspects of the knowledge corresponding to a target reference map. After the learning unit, the results showed the acquisition of higher-order domain-specific knowledge structures which indicates successful interdisciplinary learning through the hypermedia learning environment. The benefit of using a computer-assisted concept mapping assessment for research in science education, and in science classrooms is considered. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This paper explores the occurrence of conceptual incoherence in upper secondary school textbooks resulting from the use of multiple historical models. Swedish biology and chemistry textbooks, as well as a selection of books from English speaking countries, were examined. The purpose of the study was to identify which models are used to represent the phenomenon of gene function in textbooks and to investigate how these models relate to historical scientific models and subject matter contexts. Models constructed for specific use in textbooks were identified using concept mapping. The data were further analyzed by content analysis. The study shows that several different historical models are used in parallel in textbooks to describe gene function. Certain historical models were used more often then others and the most recent scientific views were rarely referred to in the textbooks. Hybrid models were used frequently, i. e. most of the models in the textbooks consisted of a number of components of several historical models. Since the various historical models were developed as part of different scientific frameworks, hybrid models exhibit conceptual incoherence, which may be a source of confusion for students. Furthermore, the use of different historical models was linked to particular subject contexts in the textbooks studied. The results from Swedish and international textbooks were similar, indicating the general applicability of our conclusions. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Understanding of Earth's systems, including the crucial role of human beings within them, is an important part of citizens' ability to think intelligently and critically about the environment, pollution, sustainability and other socio-economic and scientific issues central to life in the modern world. Part of this understanding involves seeing the world as an integrated whole in which what happens in diverse places in the world may be equally relevant for students' lives. In this regard, it makes sense to study both remote and local environments within the system thinking approach-where such distinctions naturally become blurred. The present research, accordingly, focuses on a study unit entitled "Life at the Poles" and investigates the development of junior high school students' understanding of Earth systems and their level of conceptual complexity as a result of participating in it. The "Life at the Poles" unit is based on the "explanatory story" approach where one central theme is used as a focal point for an interdisciplinary study of certain natural phenomena, in this case, the possibility of life under the extreme conditions at the poles. Concept maps and Likert-type questionnaires were employed as research tools, allowing the collected data to be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The research findings indicate that the students significantly improved their Earth systems understanding and, importantly, greatly increased their awareness of human beings' influence on the environment, including remote environments such as the pole. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Theme-based learning (TBL) refers to learning modes which adopt the following sequence: (a) finding the theme; (b) finding a focus of interest based on the theme; (c) finding materials based on the focus of interest; (d) integrating the materials to establish shared knowledge; (e) publishing and sharing the integrated knowledge. We have created an on-line system which supports the TBL mode to provide elementary school students with Web-based thematic learning. This study investigated the learning process of 40 fifth grade students in the natural science unit, "Stars and Sun", through the construction of conceptual maps supplemented with structured interviews with both instructors and students on the process and results of the Web-based thematic learning. The following conclusions were reached: (a) the Web-based thematic learning. system has positive effect on learners' concept learning; (b) the Web-based thematic learning first providing learners with a framework from which develops the related concepts, is a more stable learning mode; (c) the Web-based thematic learning system is suitable for students with different abilities. The middle achievement group of students is particularly suited to using a sharing and observation Web-based learning strategy. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).

AB  - Two experiments investigated the effects of characteristic features of concept mapping used for prior knowledge activation. Characteristic demands of concept mapping include connecting lines representing the relationships between concepts and labeling these lines, specifying the type of the semantic relationships. In the first experiment, employing a within-subjects design, 20 psychology students completed a label-provided-lines economics mapping task and then a create-and-label-lines meteorology mapping task or vice versa. The analysis of 40 think-aloud protocols indicated more elaboration processes for the label-provided-lines task than for the create-and-label-lines task. On the other hand, the protocols indicated more model-construction psychology students were randomly assigned to either a label-provided-lines mapping task or a create-and-label-lines mapping task. Subsequently, both groups completed a learning phase in a hypertext environment and a posttest. Results showed substantial differences in learning outcomes and perceived self-efficacy in favor of the label-provided-lines prior knowledge activation task. The findings are congruent with coherence effects found in text-comprehension research and support the position that concept mapping should not be seen as a unitary method but be differentiated according to the specific tasks to be completed. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This study explored the effectiveness of an inquiry-based cellulase laboratory unit in promoting inquiry in undergraduate students in biotechnology. The following tools were used to assess the students' achievements and attitude: conceptual understanding test, concept mapping, students' documents, CLES questionnaire, students' self reflection, and interviews. Judging from their conceptual understanding test results and concept mapping, students gained significantly more content knowledge on enzyme-substrate interaction and its application. In addition, students' reports on their projects revealed that they have developed their critical thinking, scientific process skills and abilities to apply knowledge on enzyme cellulase to industrial application. The students reacted positively to this teaching strategy as demonstrated by results from questionnaire responses, students' self reflection and interviews. The success of this inquiry-based laboratory unit might be due to both the context which was of interest to students, and the instruction method which ranged from a guided to a more open inquiry. Most importantly, the teacher in this study had mastery of both content and pedagogical techniques. This inquiry-based cellulase laboratory unit provided significant benefits for teaching and learning science for biotechnology students. It promoted acquisition of content knowledge and skills such as asking good questions, predicting, problem solving, drawing conclusion, and communication. This inquiry-based laboratory unit may serve as a guideline or framework for implementing a dynamic instruction with a range of inquiry level for the undergraduates. © 2010 IJESE.

AB  - Introduction: Competencies are the cornerstone of effective public health practice, and practice specialties require competencies specific to their work. Although more than 30 specialty competency sets have been developed, a particular need remained to define competencies required of professionals who practice chronic disease prevention and control. To that end, the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors (NACDD) engaged a group of stakeholders in developing competencies for chronic disease practice. Methods: Concept mapping was blended with document analysis of existing competencies in public health to develop a unique framework. Public health experts reviewed the results, providing extensive and richer understanding of the issues. Results: The final product presents an integrated picture that highlights interrelationships among the specific skills and knowledge required for leading and managing state chronic disease programs. Those competencies fall into 7 clusters: 1) lead strategically, 2) manage people, 3) manage programs and resources, 4) design and evaluate programs, 5) use public health science, 6) influence policies and systems change, and 7) build support. Conclusion: The project yielded a framework with a categorization scheme and language that reflects how chronic disease practitioners view their work, including integrating communications and cultural competency skills into relevant job functions. Influencing policies and systems change has distinct relevance to chronic disease practice. We suggest uses of the competencies in the field.

AB  - The present study conducted to investigate the contribution of conceptual change texts, accompanied by concept mapping instruction to eleventh-grade students' understanding of cellular respiration concepts, and their retention of this understanding. Cellular respiration concepts test was developed as a result of examination of related literature and interviews with teachers regarding their observations of students' difficulties. The test was administrated as pre-test, post-test, and delayed post-test to a total of 70 eleventh-grade students in two classes of the same high school in an urban area, taught by the same teacher. The experimental group was a class of 34 students who received conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping instruction. A class of 36 students comprised the control group who received traditional instruction. Besides treatment, previous understanding and logical thinking ability were other independent variables involved in this study. The results showed that logical thinking, treatment, previous understanding of cellular respiration concepts each made a statistically significant contribution to the variation in students' understanding of cellular respiration concepts. The result also showed that conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping instruction was significantly better than traditional instruction in retention of this understanding. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The study was conducted in the 2004-2005 school year using a sample of 120 students in the 7 th grade (Experimental group 1=30, Experimental group 2=30, Control group 1=30, and Control group 2=30). At the beginning of the study a prior knowledge test, science attitude scale and Multiple Intelligence Fields Determination Scale were completed by the students. At the end of the study an achievement determination questionnaire was completed by the students in the experimental and control groups. Instructional material including student worksheets, student practice questions and a teacher guide were prepared by the researchers on the Freehand MXa program. In teaching the subject to the experimental groups, a holistic instructional approach was used that combined reliance on multiple intelligence theory, a constructivist approach, deliberate use of analogies and an emphasis on science process skills. In addition, concept maps and an animation were used. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance, Cohen's size effect, and the Scheffe Test with the SPSS 11.00 program at the.05 significance level. At the beginning of the study, it was found that while there was no statistically significant difference between the students of the experimental and control groups, at the end of the study levels of achievement of the students on this subject in the two experimental groups were higher than both control groups. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology 2002.

AB  - From the authors observations and those of Kinchin (2001) teachers may know about concept mapping but they do not seem to use it as a consistent, effective strategy. The authors argue that the concept mapping may be better understood by using an expanded definition of traditional literacy, listening, speaking, reading and writing; to include visualizing, visual representation, and technological literacy Sinatra (1986). This ethnographic case study examines the use of concept mapping and collaborative learning strategies in the content area of marine ecology in high school science classrooms. To support students' understanding of science concept and the improvement of writing students began with a field trip to study inter-coastal zones and follow-up laboratory activities, use of digital image analysis, and collaborative group work. Key vocabulary were identified to begin concept maps, and more vocabulary was added to support multiple revisions of concept maps with concept map software, and culminated with students' writing. Concept mapping integrated with collaborative learning was used to engage students to construct and re-construct their understanding of a complex scientific concept, the energy cycle. The results showed that students benefited from the combination of collaborative learning and concept maps to focus their writing on key ideas, to organize their ideas, and include specific details. However, the interpretation and integration of quantitative data and laboratory results was not as consistent. Most importantly, initial concept maps and revisions provided the teacher with evidence of student learning in the form of formative assessment products, to guide teachers' focused feedback and clarify specific ideas for re-teaching, as well as students' self-assessment. The authors provide examples of concept maps and graphic organizers as formative assessment of students' knowledge, what Novak (1998) calls heuristic or "facilitative tools," and as visual representations and structures to provide flexible ways supporting learners' meaningful learning through speaking, writing and in visual forms (Sinatra, 2000; Mintzes, Wandersee, and Novak, 2004). © 2010, IGI Global.

AB  - The authors describe and discuss some recent applications of concept maps to physics teaching. They begin by reviewing the literature on applications of concept maps to science teaching, and argue for the usefulness of this resource in facilitating processes of conceptual change. They then describe two experiments on the collaborative use of concept maps to this end. The first was a study of how a team of teachers designed learning sequences using three-dimensional maps. In the second, concept maps were constructed and then collaboratively re-constructed by various groups of students. Finally, they discuss the preliminary results of these experiments on the processes of conceptual change, and suggest lines for further research. © 2010, IGI Global.

AB  - The synergic effects of knowledge accumulation, information technology development, and globalization have produced a new set of social paradigms. The transition towards a post-industrial society became evident at the beginning of the 21st century. New challenges are presented to the educational system, and a revision of methodological procedures is imperative to prepare citizens capable of dealing with complex contemporary issues. This chapter proposes 'expanded collaborative learning' for didactic activities involving peer review of any material produced by groups of students. We present a particular experience in which higher education students produced peer reviewed collaborative concept maps during an introductory course about natural sciences. Besides posing an unusual task for students, peer review changes the evaluation paradigm in traditional classrooms, reduces the power asymmetry between teacher and students, and promotes a truly collaborative atmosphere. This learning environment presents favorable conditions for empowering students, fostering them to act as autonomous citizens capable of transforming society. © 2010, IGI Global.

AB  - The introduction of concept maps to primary teachers as tools to guide and scaffold their planning of learning activities in mathematics and science, or, alternatively as an assessment tool for student learning, was treated with some trepidation and reservations. That the tools have the potential to scaffold primary students' learning and understanding of mathematics and science concepts was an idea that needed empirical testing in primary classrooms. Over a period of five school terms, through professional development, on-going professional support and collaborations between teachers and university researchers, an incremental introduction of semi-structured concept maps was initiated in two primary classrooms. This classroom trial occurred over a period of time until a more receptive and conducive learning environment was established with primary students using concept maps to review their understanding of Position in the K-Year 1 classroom and Fish's Adaptive Features and Fractions in the Year 5/6 classroom. This chapter documents the professional journey of two primary teachers and their students as they struggled, persevered and succeeded in incorporating concept maps as learning and assessment tools, as part of their normal classroom practices during the year. The ultimate highlight of the innovative strategy was the initiative by the two primary teachers and their students to come together for peer tutoring and peer collaborations as the older students mentored and assisted the younger ones in using the software Inspiration TM to construct concept maps. © 2009 Springer-Verlag US.

AB  - Concept Mapping in Mathematics: Research into Practice is the first comprehensive book on concept mapping in mathematics. It provides the reader with an understanding of how the meta-cognitive tool, namely, hierarchical concept maps, and the process of concept mapping can be used innovatively and strategically to improve planning, teaching, learning, and assessment at different educational levels. This collection of research articles examines the usefulness of concept maps in the educational setting, with applications and examples ranging from primary grade classrooms through secondary mathematics to pre-service teacher education, undergraduate mathematics and post-graduate mathematics education. A second meta-cognitive tool, called vee diagrams, is also critically examined by two authors, particularly its value in improving mathematical problem solving. The theoretical underpinnings of concept mapping and of the studies in the book include Ausubel's cognitive theory of meaningful learning, constructivist and Vygotskian psychology to name a few. There is evidence which suggests that students' mathematical literacy and problem solving skills can be enhanced through students collaborating and interacting as they work, discuss and communicate mathematically. This book proposes the meta-cognitive strategy of concept mapping as one viable means of promoting, communicating and explicating students' mathematical thinking and reasoning publicly in a social setting as they engage in mathematical dialogues and discussions. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - A research program at Cornell University that sought to study the ability of first and second grade children to acquire basic science concepts and the affect of this learning on later schooling led to the need for a new tool to describe explicit changes in children's conceptual understanding. Concept mapping was invented in 1972 to meet this need, and subsequently numerous other uses have been found for this tool. Underlying the research program and the development of the concept mapping tool was an explicit cognitive psychology of learning and an explicit constructivist epistemology, described briefly in this paper. © 2009 Springer-Verlag US.

AB  - Concept maps are an effective way of representing a person's understanding of a domain of knowledge. The traditional way of constructing concept maps uses paper and pencil. The concept maps, that time, were not easy to construct incrementally, and there was no such tools to help students to scaffold the concept maps. Although there are lots of tools to help students constructing concept maps recently, students still learning from paper textbook most of time. Additionally they have to context switch between paper and computer to search for the concepts to link and the description for the relationships of two concepts. Therefore, we propose a mechanism, Concept Base Study Guide system, by pen gesture for organizing the computer and the paper textbook to develop concept maps, and scaffold student constructing concept maps easily and incrementally.

AB  - Objectives: The objectives of this study are to analyse, through the use of concept maps, the evolution of the knowledge of obese patients after having followed an educational session and to compare the information contained in patients' concepts maps with the message delivered during education. Method: We asked 13 obese patients to drow up concept maps before and during an educational session. They completed their concept map 15 days after. They also fullfilled a questionnaire on the perceived utility of the session. Results: Before education, the patients mainly describe the diet and the surgery as means for taking care of their obesity. They most often complete their knowledge about bariatric surgery (12 of 13 patients) after the educational session. Eighty % of the concepts are added by the patients to their initial map after education; they correspond to the messages delivered during the session and mainly concern surgery and the diet after surgery. Eighty-nine % of the knowledge are true. The perception of the 13 patients towards the session is positive. Conclusion: This study shows that we may appreciate what patients learn from an educational session through the use of concept maps. © EDP Sciences, SETE, 2009.

More specifically, students teach a computer agent, Betty, and can monitor her progress by asking her questions and getting her to take quizzes. The system provides SRL support via dialog-embedded prompts. Our primary goals have been to support learning in complex science domains and facilitate development of self-regulated learning skills. Our analyses have identified actions such as "asking queries" and "tracing explanations" as key self-regulation strategies that promote learning.

AB  - This study aimed to diagnose the cognitive structure of university science pupils regarding the topic energy relationships and energy flow in organisms. The study was carried out using a word association test on 150 students studying at the Selcuk University. A word association test comprising 10 key concepts 'sunlight energy, photosynthesis, respiration, producer, consumer, separator, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ATP, glucose' was applied to the students, and concept maps were drawn according to the frequency table prepared from the answers given to the chosen key concepts. It is seen that the highest number of associations are, in descending order, sunlight-photosynthesis, producer-plants and discriminator-saprophyte. Although the students have responded to all the key concepts, it could be observed that they do not perceive the relationship between the concepts as a complete network. From this result, it is apparent that students experience very limited cognitive learning during their education. The proposal was developed on the importance of research results from the perspective of biology education, and the use of word association tests as an educational tool. © Sila Science.

AB  - Citation analysis has become a proven tool in research evaluation and policy relevant studies. Recently, J.E. Hirsch has suggested a new indicator, one single index for the assessment of the research performance of individual scientists. In a short time, Hirsch' definition was easily adapted to citations of journals and articles. The aim of this study is to discuss both what Hirsch index evolution explains us for Journal of Biological Education (JBE) and biological educational subjects which affect h-index of that journal. A case study is conducted for the h-index of JBE over period 2000-2005. By the term variable citation window h-index it meant that it was considered as a fixed moment in time when citations were collected from Web of Science. The evolution of JBE Hirsch index is shown with the self citations and the elimination of journal self citations in related figures. From the data, the Pearson correlation coefficients of regression lines are determined. The quantitative findings show that the h-index evolution of JBE has a positive trend determined in the case of the self and elimination self-citations of the journal over period 2000-2005. Furthermore, the most cited articles are about understanding of students on biological subjects, developing concept mapping in biology and students' attitutes towards biology teaching.

This project of inquiry learning employs a digital storyboard as a scaffolding strategy to facilitate reasoning ability by constructing a cognitive map. This project is composed of the two phases: 1) uncover problem-solving strategies (e.g. realistic or autistic thinking) by analyzing their learning maps when playing in a case named the Wright Brothers; and 2) investigate the effects of situated problem-solving knowledge used by the students for further inferences. It is an ongoing study focusing on qualitatively understanding the effectiveness of scaffolding strategies in a digital interactive context. The students' problem-solving strategies will be analyzed in the concept maps. In addition, the video clips and field notes as well as the e-portfolios will be collected from the Web learning and Blended teaching.

AB  - Knowledge management (KM) is the research field aimed to create, organize, and store explicit knowledge for easy access and manipulation, whereas e-learning is concerned with delivering a suite of knowledge contents to a group of learners via the Internet. Since e-learning techniques have grown quickly nowadays to complement the conventional learning system, integration of KM and elearning has been a tendency to improve the creation, organization, and delivery of a learner-oriented knowledge management system. Particularly, knowledge portal systems are usually efficient vehicles to realize this integration for we can create new content types on the portal sites to serve e-learning purpose. Nevertheless, a knowledge portal site allows the members to create and share their knowledge objects; implying that the website containing group knowledge grows itself unlimitedly and unexpectedly. To display the sitemap of a knowledge portal and observe the concept map of group knowledge, we have developed a visualization tool referred to as the Site-And-Concept (SAC) map generator. In this paper, we apply this map generator on a knowledge-portal-based e-learning system. Users can convert the generated concept maps into SCORM-compliant course packages with sequencing and navigation supports. They can further edit the learning content and share it to peer learners, and thus establish a collaborative learning environment. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - This article presents a critical review and analysis of key studies that have been done in science education and other areas on the effects and effectiveness of using diagrams, graphs, photographs, illustrations, and concept maps as adjunct visual aids in the learning of scientific-technical content. It also summarizes and reviews those studies that have students draw diagrams, graphs, maps, and charts to express their understandings of the concepts and relationships that are present in the text they read or/and empirical data provided (i.e., student-generated adjunct visual productions). In general, the research and theory on instructional aids is fragmented and somewhat unsystematic with several flaws and a number of key uncontrolled variables, which actually suppress and mask effects in the studies that have been done. The findings of these studies are compared to relevant literature and empirical research and findings in the areas of cognitive psychology, computer science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence that help to clarify many of the inconsistencies, contradictions, and lack of effects found for visual (e.g., diagrams and graphs) instructional aids in the science education literature currently and in the past 20 years. A model and a set of criteria and goals for improving research in this area is then described, as visuals are a first step in the process of learning formal (scientific) models, which are most often visually represented. Understanding how students learn formal models is one the outstanding research challenges in the next 20 years, both within and outside of science education. © Springer 2009.

AB  - In this article, we describe an innovative capstone course for preservice K-8 teachers integrating action research and a unifying theme in science (AAAS in Science for all Americans. Oxford University Press, New York, 1989; NRC in National science education standards. National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 1996). The goals of the capstone course are to increase student knowledge of the unifying theme, improve written communication skills, and introduce students to educational research. We provide evidence that each of these goals is met. Student growth in theme knowledge is demonstrated through concept maps, questionnaires, and previously reported assessments. Improved writing ability is demonstrated using the spelling and grammar checking feature of Microsoft Word. The analysis of action research reports demonstrates that students are able to connect their action research project results to previous research. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.

Each assessment method probed a different aspect of models (from growth in scientific use to need for greater emphasis on the role and use of models) and each used a different method of gathering student responses (Likert-type responses to concept maps). We determined that growth in student knowledge was demonstrated by all instruments, but some instruments were more useful than others for determining preservice elementary teachers' prior knowledge as well as growth in knowledge of models necessary for K-8 teachers. © National Science Council, Taiwan (2009).

AB  - This book provides an overview of scale and test development. From conceptualization through design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation, critical concerns are identified and grounded in the increasingly sophisticated psychometric literature. Measurement within the health, social, and behavioral sciences is addressed, and technical and practical guidance is provided. Acknowledging the increasingly sophisticated contributions in social work, psychology, education, nursing, and medicine, the book balances condensation of complex conceptual challenges with focused recommendations for conceiving, planning, and implementing psychometric study. Primary points are carefully referenced and consistently illustrated to illuminate complicated or abstract principles. Basics of construct conceptualization and establishing evidence of validity are complimented with introductions to concept mapping and cross-cultural translation. In-depth discussion of cutting edge topics like bias and invariance in item responses is provided. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic strategies are illustrated and critiqued, and step-by-step guidance is offered for anticipating elements of a complete data collection instrument, determining sampling frame and size, and interpreting resulting coefficients. Much good work has been done by RAI developers to date. Too often, practitioners or researchers either underestimate the skills and effort required, or become overwhelmed by the complexities involved. © Oxford University Press, 2013.

AB  - This study investigated how well 74 6th-grade science students represented text structures from a 900-word textbook chapter on soil conservation, given a concept map template with four superordinate terms and 24 unsorted concepts. Findings suggest students were more successful at classifying pre-selected terms under given superordinate categories than they were at fully identifying relevant concept sets and articulating three different relationship types between terms. No significant differences were noted in the mapping performance of students at different reading levels. About two-third of students indicated they enjoyed concept mapping and would prefer to both read and map rather than just read without mapping. Students also expressed a strong preference for mapping in pairs or small groups compared to mapping alone. Multiple recommendations are provided for improving the relational thinking of students tasked with concept mapping expository science texts, including bridging to more open-ended maps, embedding mapping in longer-term inquiry projects, and leveraging collaborative and tool-based scaffolds. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - Correlation is an essential concept in statistics; however, students may hold misconceptions about correlation, even after receiving instruction. This study aimed to elucidate (1) the misconceptions held by senior high school students about correlation, using the tool of concept mapping along with interviewing, (2) the possible causes of these misconceptions, and (3) the effectiveness, advantages, and limitations of the adopted concept mapping using an interviewing technique for identifying student misconceptions. Twenty-five grade-12 students who had received tuition on correlation were the subjects of this study. Concept mapping through interviewing was used to collect and analyze data in order to identify the subjects' misconceptions, and their possible causes. The major study results are as follows. (1) Seven misconceptions about correlation were detected. Of these seven misconceptions, five were newly discovered by this study, while the other two are similar to those found by previous studies. Each of the seven misconceptions was held by 20-68% of the subjects, showing their prevalence and significance. (2) Four major factors related to the development of misconceptions about correlation were identified: learning materials, language, daily-life experiences, and existing mathematical concepts. (3) The concept mapping through the interviewing technique adopted in this study was effective in detecting misconceptions about statistics, especially in revealing new misconceptions, and it was also helpful in exploring their possible causes. However, tremendous effort and the time consumed are the major limitations of this technique. (4) The paper concluded by providing some recommendations for researchers and educators. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2008.

AB  - Personal and Professional Development (PPD) is now key to the undergraduate medical curriculum and requires provision of appropriate learning experiences. In order to achieve this, it is essential that we ascertain students' perceptions of what is important in their PPD. We required a methodological approach suitable for a large medical school, which defines constructs used by the students to describe their PPD, and is not constrained by a researcher's predetermined line of questioning. It should also quantify the saliencies of these constructs in the student population and indicate how they gauge their own PPD. The instrument should also be suitable for administration at key stages of the students' learning experience. Here we describe the first stages in developing a novel method, which fulfils these requirements. It is based on a modified self repertory grid, the "Ideal Self" Inventory. All first year students (N = 379), provided five descriptors of a "good medical student" and of a not very good medical student, which generated 1,531 'ideal' qualities. To define underlying themed constructs, 49 randomly selected descriptors, were grouped together by self selected students (n = 55), using commonly held assumptions. Frequency of item co-occurrence was tabulated by multidimensional scaling. Themed clusters of 'ideal' qualities, defined by hierarchical cluster analysis, were overlaid onto the multidimensional scaling to generate a concept map. This revealed seven themed constructs; Personal Welfare, Time and Self Management Committed Work Ethic, Learning Skills, Personal Development/Reflection, Personal and Professional Conduct and Teamwork. We then analysed the 1,531 'ideal' qualities, by determining the frequency with which students used each construct and the proportion of students who used a construct at least once. Personal and Professional Conduct, Committed Work Ethic and Time and Self Management were the most frequently used, implying that they were the most salient for the first year students. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

AB  - Problem Statement: : Students' meaningful understanding of scientific concepts and topics has a major consideration in order for science education programmes' to attain their goals. The effectiveness of science instruction, which aims to assure students' complete and accurate understanding of science concepts, can only be effectively evaluated when it is measured with appropriate tools of measurement. Concept maps, multiple-choice tests and interviews, all of which are employed in determining students' understanding of science concepts, have been supported as successful methods. However, each has its own limitations. In determining students' understanding of concepts, the use of two-tier diagnostic tests - which evaluate students' understanding better and which are easy to score and apply - is recommended. The items in two-tier multiple-choice diagnostic instruments are specifically designed to identify alternative conceptions and misunderstandings in a limited and clearly defined content area. Compared with the other approaches, two-tier tests are a more advanced approach as they consider students' reasons and interpretations for their answers. Moreover, it is stated that, two-tier tests are valid and reliable instruments which evaluate student ideas better, which are easy to score and apply. Genetics is one of the biology topics that students have most difficulty in understanding. Researches demonstrate that most teachers and students hold the view that genetics topics are very difficult both to learn and to teach. Researches into determining students' understanding of genetics concepts show that students have some lack and confused knowledge on understanding these concepts, their functions and their relations. Purpose of Study: Most genetics concepts have an imaginary and theoretical characteristic. Students' learning of theoretical genetics concepts meaningfully depends on knowing hypothetical reasons of these concepts. Investigation into students' knowledge regarding genetics concepts as well as reasons on which they base their knowledge is bound to generate significant and effective consequences in determining their understanding. Therefore, this research aims to develop a two-tier test which determines secondary education students' understanding of genetics concepts, and to conduct validity and reliability studies of the test. Methods: The two-tier test directed to determining students' understanding of fundamental genetics concepts was developed by pursuing a 10-step method containing 3 main phases. First phase is about defining the content; second phase about obtaining information on students' misunderstandings, and third one is about the development of the two-tier test. In first phase, test content was defined by propositional knowledge statements and a concept map. Afterwards, propositional knowledge statements were associated with concept map; and thus the internal consistent of the content was examined. In second phase, firstly relevant literature was examined so as to determine students' misunderstandings. And secondly semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 students in order to gain a deeper perspective of students' understanding. And later they were given a multiple choice test with free-response answers in which students had to explain reasons for their answers. In third phase, two-tier test items that were composed of multiple choice content questions in first tier and in second tier a set of five justifications for all potentially selected responses to first tier were developed. The two-tier test is intended to determine students' understanding of the fundamental concepts of genetics and the relations between them as well as the relation of cell divisions with inheritance. This test is composed of two-tier 14 items. It is multiple-choice type in both tiers, and the number of choices is 3 in first tier and 5 in second tier. In order to consider a question as correctly answered, it needs to be answered correctly in both content and reason tiers. Research was conducted with 231 secondary education students. The age range of research group students was between 16 and 19. Of the group, 118 (51.1%) were girls and 113 (48.9%) were boys. Students attended Anatolian high schools, State high schools, and high schools with an intensive foreign language programme, where the same biology curriculum had been applied. The data obtained from two-tier test application were made subject to item analysis and test analysis. Following analyses, difficulty and discrimination of items, functionality of distracters and test reliability were determined. Answers were sought to two basic questions for the purposes of validity determination: first, whether or not the items measured the content that was defined by propositional knowledge statements; and second whether or not the items were suitable to the level of the research group. Expert opinion was consulted for content validity, and was checked with propositional knowledge statements as well as with concept map. A specification grid was designed in order to determine face validity. As to construct validity, the method of group differences was utilized. Findings and Results: After conducting item analysis difficulty and discrimination indices of each item were calculated. Item discrimination indices were found to between 0.34 and 0.74. These values demonstrated that items functioned in a satisfactory way. And item difficulty indices were between 0.25 and 0.67, and had a distribution in a large interval. Test mean was found as 6.02 and test difficulty as 0.43. Test reliability was found to be 0.86. The functionality of distracters analyses showed that distracters functioned well and that there was no need for modifications in choices. In order to determine construct validity, correlation between the data obtained from students of Anatolian high schools and state high schools plus high schools with an intensive foreign language programme was calculated, and was found to be 0.169. The fact that this value was low was an indicator of test construct validity. Conclusions: All the findings obtained from the item analysis, validity and reliability analyses of two-tier test indicate that this test could be used reliably and in a valid way to determine secondary school students' understanding of genetics concepts. Findings also show that students performed better when only first part of items was considered, than when both parts of items were considered. This indicates that students have selected the correct content response through rote learning without an understanding of the underlying reasons. Recommendations: The fact that the test is a multiple-choice type makes it easy to apply and to score for teachers. In addition, thanks to the availability of reason questions, teachers will be able to evaluate students' understanding of concepts more effectively. When effectively used, these tests are likely to contribute to students' deeper understanding of science concepts. © 2009.

AB  - Objectives: This study describes how the obese patient's initial mental states evolved two years after surgery and their perception of therapeutic education. Methods: Twenty-four patients reviewed during telephone interviews the concept map they had fulfilled before surgery. Patients' comments were analysed on the basis of their trend to confirm or refute their initial representations. Results: Twenty-three patients confirm most of their initial representations. Eight over twenty negative initial representations, often related to diet field, became positive; 21% positive initial mental states became negative in differents fields. Most of the added comments had negative tendency (17 over 23) and 6 were related to the patient's difficulties to cope with diet. Psychological and health consequences constitute the most important issues for 1/3 patients. Fourteen patients consider they have been well educated before intervention, 7 patients stress the importance of meeting other operated patients before surgery. Patients' recommendations for therapeutic education concern post operative pains, nutrition difficulties and risk of weight regain. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the quality of therapeutic education before surgery. The difficulties related to nutrition and weight regain stress the importance of long term therapeutic education promoting patients group discussion. The use of concept maps develops the patient self evaluation skill. © EDP Sciences, SETE, 2009.

AB  - Problem Statement: The effectiveness of science instruction, which aims to assure students’ complete and accurate understanding of science concepts, can only be effectively evaluated when it is measured using the appropriate measurement tools. Concept maps, multiple-choice tests, and interviews – all of which are employed in determining students’ understanding of science concepts – have been shown to be successful methods. However, each has its own limitations. In determining students’ understanding of concepts, the use of two-tier tests – which evaluate students’ understanding more effectively and which are easy to score and apply – is recommended. Purpose of Study: One of the topics of biology that students experience great difficulty in understanding is genetics. This study aims at developing a two-tier test which is able to effectively evaluate secondary education students’ understanding of the concepts of genetics, and conducting the validity and reliability analyses of the test. Methods: The two-tier test, which is aimed at determining secondary education students’ understanding of the fundamental concepts of genetics, was developed using a three-phase method. In the first phase, the test content was defined. In the second phase, the relevant literature was examined so as to determine students’ misunderstandings; students were interviewed, and they were given a multiple choice test with free-response answers in which they had to explain the reasons for their answers. In the third phase, 14 two-tier test items which were composed of multiple choice content questions in the first tier and a set of five justifications for every potentially selected response to the first tier were developed. The test was applied to 231 students, and then item analysis was performed. Test reliability was calculated using the Kuder-Richardson 20 formula. In order to determine construct validity, the method of group differences was employed. Findings and Results: The discrimination indices of items were found to be between 0.34 and 0.74. Item difficulties fell in the range of 0.25 to 0.67, and the test difficulty was found to be 0.43. Test reliability was calculated as 0.86. Conclusions: All the findings obtained from the item analysis, in addition to the findings from the validity and the reliability studies; demonstrate that the test may be utilized to determine secondary education students’ understanding of the concepts of genetics concepts in a valid and reliable way. Recommendations: Besides making a more effective evaluation possible, two-tier tests facilitate application and scoring. Therefore, we believe that developing and using such two-tier diagnostic tests in various fields will make significant contributions to science instruction. © 2009, Ani Publishing.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate whether a chemistry laboratory course called "Laboratory Experiments in Science Education" based on constructivist instruction accompanied with concept mapping enhanced pre-service chemistry teachers' conceptual understanding. Data were collected from five pre-service chemistry teachers at a university in Ankara by means of a concept test and semi-structured interviews. Results showed that pre-service teachers had some alternative conceptions about chemistry topics. Moreover, using constructivist instruction accompanied with concept maps as an instructional tool was effective to promote conceptual understanding. Participants thought that concept maps were useful especially in recognizing the relation between different chemistry concepts. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Our paper presents an in-service primary school teachers' training program which is based on the idea that the history of science can play a vital role in promoting the learning of physics. This training program has been developed in the context of Comenius 2.1 which is a European Union program. This program that we have developed in the University of Athens is based on socioconstructivist and sociocultural learning principles with the intention of helping teachers to appropriate the basic knowledge on the issue of falling bodies. Moreover, it has the aim to make explicit through the exploitation of authentic historical science events, on the above topic (Aristotle's, Galileo's and Newton's theories on falling bodies) the Nature of Science (NoS), the Nature of Learning (NoL) and the Nature of Teaching (NoT). During the implementation of the program we have used a variety of teaching strategies (e.g. group work, making of posters, making of concept maps, simulations) that utilize historical scientific materials on the issue of falling bodies. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Simply placing electronic geoscience resources such as datasets, methods, ontologies, workflows and articles in a digital library or cyberinfrastructure does not mean that they will be used successfully by other researchers or educators. It is also necessary to provide the means to locate potentially useful content, and to understand it. Without suitable provision for these needs, many useful resources will go undiscovered, or else will be found but used inappropriately. In this article, we describe an approach to discovering, describing and understanding e-resources based on the notion that meaning is carried in the interconnections between resources and the actors in the cyberinfrastructure (including individuals, groups, organizations), as well as by ontologies and conventional metadata. Navigation around this universe is achieved by implementing the idea of perspectives as dynamic, conceptual views (defined by SPARQL-like queries against an OWL schema) that not only act as filters, but also dynamically promote and demote concepts, relationships and properties according to their immediate relevance. We describe a means to represent a wide variety of interactions between resources using the notion of a knowledge nexus, and we illustrate its use with resources and actors from the Geosciences Network (GEON) cyberinfrastructure community. We also closely link browsing and visualizing strategies to our nexus, drawing on ideas from semiotics to move resources and connections not currently of interest from the foreground to the background, and vice versa, using a new form of adaptive perspective. We illustrate our ideas via ConceptVista, an open-source concept mapping application that provides rich, visual depictions of the resources, cyber-community and myriad connections between them. Examples are presented that show how geoscientific knowledge can be explored not only via ontological structure, but also by use cases, social networks, citation graphs and organization charts; all of which may carry some aspects of meaning for the user. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study conducted by based on student drawings and interviews was held with the aim of determining misconceptions of science students receiving education in universities about the water cycle. There are a number of techniques to indicate misconceptions of students. Open ended questions, two-stage diagnosis tests, concept maps, word association and interviews are some of these techniques. In addition, science educators have started to use drawings methods in order to ensure students to understand science and to obtain knowledge about their misconceptions recently. As a result of analysis of drawings and interviews, it was seen that more than half of students has comprehensive or partially conceptual knowledge, but approximately one fourth of students has misconceptions about this subject. In addition, it was determined that students have misconceptions like water cycle is only evaporation of water from the earth to the atmosphere and its return to the earth from the atmosphere by condensing. © 2009 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - Maps of the world are common in classroom settings. They are used to teach the juxtaposition of natural and political functions, mineral resources, political, cultural and geographical boundaries; occurrences of processes such as tectonic drift; spreading of epidemics; and weather forecasts, among others. Recent work in scientometrics aims to create a map of science encompassing our collective scholarly knowledge. Maps of science can be used to see disciplinary boundaries; the origin of ideas, expertise, techniques, or tools; the birth, evolution, merging, splitting, and death of scientific disciplines; the spreading of ideas and technology; emerging research frontiers and bursts of activity; etc. Just like the first maps of our planet, the first maps of science are neither perfect nor correct. Today's science maps are predominantly generated based on English scholarly data: Techniques and procedures to achieve local and global accuracy of these maps are still being refined, and a visual language to communicate something as abstract and complex as science is still being developed. Yet, the maps are successfully used by institutions or individuals who can afford them to guide science policy decision making, economic decision making, or as visual interfaces to digital libraries. This paper presents the process and results of creating hands-on science maps for kids that teaches children ages 4-14 about the structure of scientific disciplines. The maps were tested in both formal and informal science education environments. The results show that children can easily transfer their (world) map and concept map reading skills to utilize maps of science in interesting ways. © 2009 SPIE-IS&T.

AB  - A method for uncovering students' thinking about thinking, specifically their meta-strategic knowledge, is explored within the context of an ongoing, multi-year intervention designed to promote the development of students' thinking dispositions. The development of a concept-map instrument that classroom teachers can use and an analytic framework for interpreting students' responses is presented. In a preliminary study, the concept map instrument is piloted to evaluate changes in students' conceptions of thinking after a year's participation in classrooms where their teachers actively sought to make thinking more visible by noticing and naming the thinking observed as well as introducing and using thinking routines (Ritchhart and Perkins. Educational Leadership, 65(5), 57-61 2008). Concept maps from 239 students from grades 3 through 11 were analyzed. Results suggest that students' conceptions of thinking do improve with age but also can be substantially developed through a classroom culture where thinking is modeled and rich opportunities for thinking are present. The concept map instrument itself proved to be a robust instrument for uncovering students' thinking about thinking. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - This paper presents a study carried out at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU with the aim of evaluating the CM-ED (concept map editor) with social education students. Concept mapping is a widely accepted technique that promotes meaningful learning. Graphically representing concepts of the learning domain and relationships between them helps students integrate new knowledge into their current cognitive structure. Due to the flexibility of computer-aided drawing graphs, several concept mapping tools have been developed and their use has been studied over the last few years. CM-ED is a multilingual and multimedia software program designed for drawing concept maps. Until recently, CM-ED had been mainly used and evaluated in computer science university degree. This paper represents a qualitative step in the evaluation of CM-ED: from technical students to students of more theoretical fields. The main characteristics of the CM-ED editor and the carried out study are presented in this paper. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The researchers investigated the comparative effects of individually-constructed and collaboratively-constructed computer-based concept mapping on middle school science concept learning. One hundred and sixty one students completed the entire study. Using prior science performance scores to assure equivalence of student achievement across groups, students were assigned to three groups: a self-selected study strategy group, an individual-concept mapping group, and a collaborative pairs - concept mapping group. Collaboratively and individually-constructing computer-based concept maps had equally positive effects on seventh grade middle school science concept learning as measured on a comprehension test. However, the students who collaboratively constructed concept maps created significantly higher quality concept maps than those who individually constructed concept maps indicating deeper conceptual understanding. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Science assessment in secondary schools requires instruments and techniques that reveal the depth and complexity of students' science understandings and capabilities. Because students' knowledge, reasoning, and skills vary across science domains and contexts, assessments must encompass a range of tasks, formats, and techniques. This article focuses on six types of assessment: question–demonstration assessments, performance assessments, information technologies, conceptual inventories and item clusters, concept maps, and student notebooks. For each of these, distinctive features are outlined; example items are provided; and formative and summative uses are described where applicable. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The University of Cincinnati (UC) College of Engineering offers a college-wide Preparing Future Faculty (PFF) program to address the need for more qualified faculty in engineering programs and to improve the overall educational environment. The UC PFF program consists of three one-hour courses and a mentored teaching component. The first course, in the Winter Quarter, provides information on basic effective teaching techniques for engineering, including Kolb learning styles, and how to organize a course. In addition, cultural differences and diversity are discussed in the context of science and engineering classes. The advanced teaching class in Spring Quarter emphasizes advanced pedagogical techniques including Bloom's taxonomy, concept maps, project and team management for developing leadership skills, teaching evaluations, proposal writing, and mentoring and being mentored. ABET engineering criteria a-k are applied to syllabus development, and students hold a mock NSF review panel based on a proposed project in engineering education. The final course, in Autumn Quarter, explores the academic job search process and the range of academic careers available. Panel discussions with new faculty, hiring committees from teaching-oriented and research-oriented universities, and recently tenured faculty provide up-to-date information. This paper focuses on the experience of a PFF student participant during the 2006-2007 academic year, as well as the experiences of and benefits to his PFF program coordinator and academic research mentor. Overall, participating in the program helped the student to prepare for an academic career. Having two faculty mentors in the PFF program activities provided invaluable opportunities and feedback. The mentored teaching activities applied the concepts learned in the PFF courses. The individualized mentored teaching experience included teaching undergraduate and graduate courses, giving talks at research seminars, and mentoring senior projects and REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) students in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC. Various methods of active learning, motivating students, problem-based active laboratory learning, and peer tutoring were explored and applied to mentor students. The paper also includes feedback from the PFF program coordinator and the academic research mentor. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2009.

AB  - In this work mind maps and concept maps will be used to facilitate the process of learning by quantifying the ability of students to connect existing memories to new concepts. Research from cognitive and neural science indicates that learning occurs through the repeated process of storing, retrieving, and connecting information. Aligning instruction with the way in which students learn is difficult. Instruction is often delivered using a topic-by-topic presentation of material because the instructor's expertise in a field, coupled with repeated application of concepts, facilitates this approach. Instructors are able to quickly and easily retrieve information because they have a vast network of neural paths developed through repeated use. Students, on the other hand, are faced with both establishing the connection of stored information to new concepts and strengthening the connection with repeated use. If the connection between retrieved information and the new concept is made, learning will occur - otherwise it will not. This research explores the use of mind maps and concept maps as quantitative tools to measure the learning process of students and to identify important missing connections between concepts. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2009.

AB  - Over the last 25 years the Department of Chemical Engineering at Curtin University of Technology has delivered a very traditional curriculum providing graduates with a strong practical orientation. Recent feedback from industry has, however, emphasised the need for graduates to have improved problem solving skills, interpersonal group skills and critical thinking. Problem Based Learning (PBL) is a learning environment in which the problem drives the learning. It has proved to be an effective and an enjoyable experience. However, most of the PBL courses were developed in the area of health sciences with very few engineering departments fully implementing the approach. Is PBL actually more difficult to implement into an engineering course? What issues do we have to consider in developing a suitable unit structure for PBL? This paper presents challenges being faced to implement PBL techniques in Risk Management, one of the chemical engineering degree's 4th year units, in order to create a learning environment that involves active and cooperative learning, prompt feedback, critical thinking, student accountability and a fun experience. The paper will discuss aspects of our executable plan of action for PBL implementation for this unit.

AB  - Science communication courses are becoming increasingly more popular in universities across the United States and several other countries-particularly tailored courses for specific disciplines (i.e. science communication for clinical sciences, professional writing for veterinarians, science and medical writing, communication skills for engineering students, writing in the health professions, etc.). This requires collaboration and integration of concepts and teaching methods between communication-and science-related disciplines to create these integrated, focused courses. This paper presents an examination of schema theory, mental modeling, concept mapping, and other information processing theories that have been used to teach communication, mathematics, and science information. The author explores how teachers from these different disciplines organize and present content-specific information to help facilitate learning and memory in students. Integrating teaching strategies from different disciplines may help for presenting science communication information. The paper also provides a few ideas on how science communication instructors might incorporate different teaching strategies from communication-, mathematics-, and science-related disciplines. © Common Ground, Raquel Harper, Donna Rouner, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Several series studies related to school science teachers’ PCK. Chapter one first describes the social constructive framework related to the research model. Then it addresses the related literature concerning PCK of pre-service and in-service science teachers, as well as the merits of models. Finally, a research-based model for PCK is presented. The process of PCK development involves the PCK-COPR module (Comprehension, Observation, Practice and Reflection).Then, chapter two demonstrated a group of pre-service teachers (n=23) to participate a technology-based PCK-COPR model designed to restructure science teacher education courses. There were significant differences in ’‘pedagogical knowledge’', '‘technology knowledge’’ and '‘overall PCK’’ (F = 4.123, p < 0.05, F = 9.260, p < 0.01, and F= 6.372, p < 0.05, respectively.), but no significant differences in the other aspects. The innovative teaching experience could help pre-service teachers develop multiple teaching methods and strategies, and further enhanced their PCK. Chapter three was to examine the eighth-grade students’ perceptions of science teachers’ PCK difference between beginning teachers and experienced teachers, and the effects of applying the PCK-COPR model in the concepts of '‘electric circuits’'. The research methods of students’ perceptions and teachers’ reflection could increase the learning and research experience of both in-service science teachers and the instructors and also serve as useful reference for other in-service teacher education institutes. Chapter four aimed to explore the impact of integrating a peer-coaching model into team teaching on PCK development of team teachers of secondary integrated science from a social constructivist approach. The research design included two-semester peer coaching and one-semester team teaching. Two simultaneous interventions should be conducive to science teachers’ creative thinking and collaborative relationship. Chapter five evaluated a three-stage collaborative concept-mapping technique in the fourth-grade science classes. The major issue investigated includes the student performance and responses toward the experimental teaching method. The findings showed that the two teaching methods reached significant difference with respect to students’ test scores. The experimental teaching method provided interaction, presentation and a way of progressing to enhance the learning outcome. Two studies demonstrated the innovative approaches of teaching and learning mathematics. Chapter six evaluated a collaborative learning model integrated into team teaching in the sixth-grade math classes. Three mathematics classes were assigned to Experimental Groups and Control Group for eight weeks in this study. The findings of the study showed the experimental teaching method enhanced students’ performance. Chapter seven was to evaluate a technology environment integrated into collaborative learning in sixth-graders’ mathematics classes. The study focused the advantage of the constructivist view of teaching and learning process, which mainly highlighted three aspects including “active construction”, “experiential learning” and “social interaction”. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - For students of health sciences, knowledge of biology is a cornerstone to successfully face the challenges presented to them related to this field of knowledge and to interpret specific phenomena of medical science and health. This paper shows the results of the use of the concept maps for meaningful learning of cellular biology concepts. Objective: to determine the effectiveness of the concept maps as a didactic strategy in the learning of concepts of cellular Biology in students of Health Sciences. Material and methods: It was worked with a cuasi-experimental design of pre-test and post-test with two intact groups: an experimental group (it used the concept maps as learning strategy) and a control group (it did not use the concept maps as learning strategy). The students were evaluated using a pre-test and post-test, built with multiple-choice questions with one answer in the levels of knowledge, comprehension and analysis of the cognitive domain of Bloom's Taxonomy. Results: In the post-test found no significant differences in the total number of questions. However significant differences were found between groups in the application level, observing better results in the experimental group. Conclusions: The concept maps gave students a tool to learn concepts of cell biology significantly. However, its effective use depends on factors such as motivation for learning, continuous training in mapping, significant contents of learning and implementation time.

AB  - "Slowmation" (abbreviated from "Slow Motion Animation) is a new yet simple form of stopmotion animation which enables learners to create their own animations of science concepts. This paper presents a study of preservice elementary teachers in a science method classes (14 in one class in 2009) to ascertain if they improved their science knowledge when using a three phase framework requiring them to: (i) create their own Slowmation about a science concept; (ii) upload them to a web site (www.slowmation.com.au) so that they could be reviewed by a peer and a content expert; and (iii) if necessary, modify the animation and reupload it to be published on the Slowmation website. The two research questions were: (i) How did the three phase framework change the preservice teachers' science content knowledge and (ii) What was the value and motivation of the web site, for uploading and reviewing the animations? Qualitative data (three interviews, two concept maps and the animations as knowledge artifacts) collected from each preservice teacher showed that all of them increased their science content knowledge as a result of using the framework. Uploading the Slowmations to the website was successful for the students and enabled them to view other animations and created a social motivation to make and improve their animations. Getting preservice teachers to create Slowmations is a new way for them to engage with science content knowledge and is a new way for them to represent their science understandings. © Common Ground, David Macdonald, Garry Hoban.

AB  - Students in a Landscape Architecture Design 1 course (N = 25) at a research university in the southern US developed design solutions implementing geologic time for an informal education site. Those students who employed abstract metaphors for their designs (n = 8) were more successful than students who proceeded with a linear design construct. Pre- and posttest assessments using the Petrified Wood Survey and student-constructed timelines suggested that 1) 75% geoscience content knowledge is needed for successful design, and 2) relative understanding of Earth events and the barrenness of early Earth's landscape is also prerequisite for successful design implementation. Most revealing of students' cognitive processes were the concept statements and concept maps produced during the project. The concept statement forced students to address the project's requirements, take a position with their concept development of abstract metaphorical representation, and proceed with a final design solution. It appears that concept statements with accompanying concept maps facilitate student cognition by forcing student comprehension and application of geoscience content knowledge. We suggest that an inclusion of concept statements when teaching application of a complex Earth system or process may facilitate students' geoscience cognition in design and/or informal educational settings.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of metaconceptual teaching interventions on students' understanding of force and motion concepts. A multimethod research design including quasi-experimental design and case study designs was employed to compare the effect of the metaconceptual activities and traditional instruction and investigate students' reactions to metaconceptual teaching interventions. The participants (45 high school students in the USA) were enrolled in one of the two physics classes instructed by the same science teacher. In the experimental group, students' engagement in metaconceptual knowledge and processes was facilitated through various instructional activities, including poster drawing, journal writing, group debate, concept mapping, and class and group discussions. These activities were intended to facilitate students' engagement in (a) becoming aware of their existing and past conceptions, associated beliefs, everyday experiences, and contextual differences, (b) monitoring their understanding of the new conception, the changes in ideas, and the consistency between existing and new conceptions, and (c) evaluating the relative ability of competing conceptions to explain a physical phenomenon. In the comparison group, the same content knowledge was explained by the teacher along with the use of laboratory experiments, demonstrations, and quantitative problem solving. Students' reactions to the designed instructional activities indicated that metaconceptual teaching interventions were successful in facilitating students' engagement in several types of metaconceptual functioning. The results showed that students in the experimental group had significantly better conceptual understanding than their counterparts in the comparison group and this positive impact remained after a period of 9 weeks. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

AB  - The research reported here consists of the introduction of an intervention based on a series of laboratory activities combined with concept mapping. The purpose of this intervention was to enhance student understanding of acid-base chemistry for tenth grade students' from two classes in a Turkish high school. An additional aim was to enhance student attitude toward chemistry. In the research design, two cohorts of students were compared; those from the intervention group (N∈=∈31) and a second group (N∈=∈28) who were taught in a more traditional manner. Student understanding of acid-base chemistry was evaluated with a pretest/posttest research design using a purpose-designed instrument, the Concept Achievement Test (CAT) consisting of 25 items, 15 multiple choice and ten multiple choice with explanation. Alternative conceptions identified in the pretest were incorporated into the intervention, which thereby sought to move students toward views more in accord with scientific views for the concepts. Statistical tests indicate the instrument is reliable (with an alpha reliability of 0.81) and the analysis of the findings revealed statistically significant differences between the intervention and traditional groups with respect to conceptual understanding. Examination of student explanations and analyses of semi-structured interviews conducted with selected students suggest that the main influence was the laboratory activities. Analysis of the findings in the context of relevant literature that concept mapping in conjunction with laboratory activities is more enjoyable, helps student link concepts, and reduces their alternative conceptions. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2007.

AB  - Concept Map (CMap) is a graphical knowledge representation system, which has received growing popularity as a teaching and evaluation tool. In CMaps knowledge is represented by linking concepts to one another and specifying the nature of their relationship on the link. A pair of concepts connected with a linking phrase is called proposition. In general, knowledge is organized by relating different concepts to one another. We argue that there are two types of conceptual relationships: static and dynamic. The static relationship organizes knowledge by grouping similar items under the same concept and noting the belongingness of the concept to a more abstract construct as a super-ordinate or identifying its own sub-categories. For example, category "chair" is a part of a superordinate category "furniture" and may have sub-categories of "lawn chair" and "dining room chair." In addition, static meaningful relationships could be based on intersecting two constructs from different domains. For example, "design" and "chair" may be intersected by noting that "chair" requires "design." Organization of knowledge based on static relationships often results in hierarchical arrangement of concepts, which is very typical of most Concept Maps. On the other hand, the dynamic relationships reflect how change in one concept affects another concept. The emphasis is on showing the functional interdependency between concepts. For example, "increase in the amount of gasoline consumption" results in "increase in the level of carbon dioxide in the environment." The dynamic relationships have played an important role in the advancement of physical sciences. For example, Newton invented calculus as a representation system for dynamic relationships. Similarly, we argue that Concept Maps need the capability for representing dynamic relationships. However, CMap, in its traditional form, primarily encourages static thinking. In this chapter we, on one hand, bring attention to this tendency and, on the other hand, discuss the strategies teachers can use to encourage dynamic thinking with Concept Maps. These strategies include: • imposing a cyclic map structure instead of hierarchical arrangement of concepts, • quantifying the root concept of the map instead of a static category, and • reformulating the focus question of the map from "what" to "how." We discuss theoretical issues and empirical evidence in support of the proposed strategies. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Learning with self-explaining examples is an effective method in well-structured domains. We analyzed this method in teaching the complex skill of argumentation. In an experiment we compared three conditions (n = 47 students of educational sciences) that differed with respect to whether and how the processing of the examples was supported by different help functions. The analysis of the video-based examples was either supported by additional examples displaying the equivalent argumentative structure or by Conceptmaps visualizing the argumentative structure. The control group received no help. We found that examples of argumentation could be successfully employed in order to teach skills of argumentation. Covariance Analysis revealed no main effect of help design on learning outcome. However there was a significant effect of learners' help seeking activities. Learners who used the help facilities more often showed significant higher learning outcomes. Principal based help facilities (concept maps) thereby were most accepted by the learners.

AB  - This study explores students understanding of key concepts in nanoscience with the intention of identifying a potential threshold concept in the field through the analysis of student concept maps and explanatory interviews. The analysis of students' maps indicates conceptual development and learning difficulties in learning size-dependent property change at the Nano-scale. In addition, it identifies potential threshold concepts in the study and understanding of nanoscale science from the students' perspective. It also indicates the importance of previous learning in science to integrate isolated concepts and to help students achieve a deeper understanding of key phenomena at the nanoscale.

AB  - In an empirical study, eye-gaze patterns of pairs of students were recorded and analyzed in a remote situation where they had to build a concept map collaboratively. They were provided (or not), with a knowledge awareness tool that provided learner A with learner B's level of knowledge measured through a pre-test. Previous results showed that the awareness tool positively affected learning gain by enhancing the production of elaborative talk and knowledge negotiation. In the present paper, we describe the actual use of a knowledge awareness tool during the course of interaction by analyzing the gaze paths recorded during the experiment and how they relate to learning performance and verbal interactions. The results showed that learners refer to the knowledge awareness tool episodically during the course of collaboration, mainly to assess the epistemic value of the information provided by the peer, especially when the peer seems uncertain about his understanding. The potential of the synchronized eye-tracking method for research in computer supported collaborative learning is discussed.

AB  - A concept map consists of nodes representing concepts and links representing the relationships between the concepts. To examine the influence of concept mapping on learning from texts, we varied the support strategies. Eighty students either learned by constructing concept maps on their own, by correcting an incorrect worked-out map, or by studying a correct worked-out map. A control group did not engage in any follow-up activity for learning from text. As expected, learners profited most from studying the correct worked-out map. Students who corrected an incorrect worked-out map did not have a better learning result than students who generated concept maps on their own or the control group. On the contrary, they produced many false conclusions in the comprehension test.

AB  - In the present study, participants working in dyads were asked to build a concept map collaboratively. While interacting, they were able to access visualizations (individual concept maps) of both their own and their partner's prior knowledge (own and peer maps). Eye movements of both learning partners were recorded during the course of collaboration. Our goal was twofold. First, we focused on transactivity at both the visual and action levels. Second, we investigated the effects of knowledge interdependence with the partner on transactivity in collaborative concept mapping. We found that the degree to which participants co-manipulate the same objects in the collaborative map (action transactivity) is higher when they discussed identical (rather than complementary) information. Results from eye-gaze data showed that participants who shared complementary information transitioned more frequently between their own map and their partner's map; eye-movement transitions between own and peer maps were also negatively correlated with learning outcomes.

AB  - Concept Mapping is a technique that allows information visualization. A Concept Map is a graphical way of representing and organizing knowledge. It is comprised of nodes and links, arranged in some spatial distribution to reflect the domain information. Nodes represent concepts, and links represent the relationship between concepts; both concepts and links are labeled and may be categorized. Inside the educational area concept maps can be used for supporting learning, for assessing learning, and also for organizing and presenting information. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence is a compulsory subject studied at the first term of the Computer Science degree in the University of the Basque Country. In this work a study carried out by 6 voluntary students with the aim of organizing ah the learning resources (theoretical contents, laboratories, exercises,...) related to that subject by means of a concept map is presented. CM-ED is the Concept Map EDitor used to fulfill this objective. Representing the variety of learning resources related to the subject in a visual format makes it easier their organization and their later visualization and searching. © 2008 IEEE.

The sample of this study consisted of 5th grade students from two classes of a elementary school (n=75). One intact class was randomly assigned to the comparison group whereas the other one was randomly assigned to the experimental group. During teaching the topic of heat and temperature concepts in earth science curriculum, the experimental group was taught with the concept mapping instruction while the comparison group was taught with the traditional instruction. The results revealed that the students in the experimental group performed better on heat and temperature concepts. However, it has been found that there was no significant difference between experimental and control group on students' retention scores of heat and temperature concept test.

AB  - In order to obtain semantic interoperability in open systems, the systems involved need to agree on commonly understandable knowledge representations. The case considered in this paper is one of a system needing to communicate and share knowledge using concept maps and ontologies, in the context of the environmental sciences and the semantic Web. We present how to formally obtain ontologies codified in the OWL language from concept maps. Concept maps are a flexible and informal form of knowledge representation, while OWL is a language oriented to processing carried out by machines. The mapping between concept maps and ontologies is a formal transformation, which semantically analyzes the relations linking the concepts in the map. The proposed method includes a concept-sense disambiguation procedure and uses the WordNet lexical knowledge base. It also includes automatic learning of the semantics of the relations between concepts. The proposed method has been applied to the environmental-knowledge domain, through tests of several concept maps with labels in Spanish.

AB  - This study was designed to theoretically articulate and empirically assess the role of computer scaffolds. In this project, several examples of educational software were developed to scaffold the learning of students performing high level cognitive activities. The software used in this study, Artemis, focused on scaffolding the learning of students as they performed information seeking activities. As 5th grade students traveled through a project-based science unit on photosynthesis, researchers used a pre-post design to test for both student motivation and student conceptual understanding of photosynthesis. To measure both variables, a motivation survey and three methods of concept map analysis were used. The student use of the scaffolding features was determined using a database that tracked students' movement between scaffolding tools. The gain scores of each dependent variable was then correlated to the students' feature use (time and hits) embedded in the Artemis Interface. This provided the researchers with significant relationships between the scaffolding features represented in the software and student motivation and conceptual understanding of photosynthesis. There were a total of three significant correlations in comparing the scaffolding use by hits (clicked on) with the dependent variables and only one significant correlation when comparing the scaffold use in time. The first significant correlation (r = .499, p < .05) was between the saving/viewing features hits and the students' task value. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the saving/viewing features and the students' perception of how interesting, how important, and how useful the task is. The second significant correlation (r = 0.553, p < 0.01) was between the searching features hits and the students' self-efficacy for learning and performance. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the searching features and the students' perception of their ability to accomplish a task as well as their confidence in their skills to perform that task. The third significant correlation (r = 0.519, p < 0.05) was between the collaborative features hits and the students' essay performance scores. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the collaborative features and the students' ability to perform high cognitive tasks. Finally, the last significant correlation (r = 0.576, p < 0.01) was between the maintenance features time and the qualitative analysis of the concept maps. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the maintenance features and student conceptual understanding of photosynthesis. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - For a modern e-Learning platform, it has to confront with an important issue that is how to provide meaningful learning for learners. In this paper, we used the method of concept maps to integrate the four tiers, which are knowledge management, instructional, learning and technological tier, in order to achieve the meaningful learning. The significance of concept maps is not only on the promotion of knowledge concepts and action skills, but also on the affection which can be rendered the right cognition and values for learners. Finally, this research proposed a Knowledge Management Learning System (KMLS), where it can support learning-process progress and facilitate learners' learning more meaningfully. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - To examine the effects of the use of podcasting in the learning of scientific English in the university setting, this study was conducted in two English scientific listening and speaking classes taught by the researcher-teacher at a medical university in Taipei, TAIWAN from November to December 2007. Podcasts on science were used as learning materials. Learning outcome assessments include concept-mapping, oral tests, and scientific essay writing. Students' use of tools: PCs, MP3s, and MP4s, their frequency, duration, and location of use, and motivation and learning attitude were assessed by questionnaires. Experimental results show that due to the activation of higher-order thinking and cognitive engagement, deep learning was facilitated in students' learning processes. Besides, a preference of using MP3s for the learning of scientific English and a preference of using MP4s for deep learning of science and scientific English were identified in this study. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - An electronic portfolio system, designed to serve as a resource-based learning space, was tested in a fifth-grade science class. The control-group students accessed a traditional folder-based information display in the system and the experimental-group students accessed a concept map-based information display to review a science portfolio. The student-constructed science portfolio was a result of a collection of digital artefacts such as graphic images, instructional videos and textual files on terms and definitions relevant to the Earth's atmosphere. In the information-processing performance test, the experimental-group students scored significantly higher and spent much less time in finding answers to the questions presented. Also, in the 3-day delayed memory retention tests, the experimental-group students achieved significantly higher scores. The multiple regression models confirm that the visualisation variation is the most significant predictor for student performance (ie, comprehension and access time). Also, the regression models suggest that language-arts proficiency may reduce overall system access time; while higher math proficiency may predict retention scores. © 2007 British Educational Communications and Technology Agency.

AB  - The skill set required of biomedical researchers continues to grow and evolve as biology matures as a natural science. Science necessitates creative yet critical thinking, persuasive communication skills, purposeful use of time, and adeptness at the laboratory bench. Teaching these skills can be effectively accomplished in an inquiry-based, active-learning environment at a primarily undergraduate institution. Cell Biology Techniques, an upper-level cell biology laboratory course at St. John Fisher College, features two independent projects that take advantage of the biology of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a premier yet simple model organism. First, students perform a miniature epigenetic screen for novel phenotypes using RNA interference. The results of this screen combined with literature research direct students toward a singe gene that they attempt to subclone in the second project. The biology of the chosen gene/protein also becomes an individualized focal point with respect to the content of the laboratory. Progress toward course goals is evaluated using written, oral, and group-produced assignments, including a concept map. Pre- and postassessment indicates a significant increase in the understanding of broad concepts in cell biological research. © 2008 by The American Society for Cell Biology.

AB  - Although collaborative group work is used by many instructors as a useful educational tool, there is much room for research on how learning actually occurs within collaborative learning environments. This paper attempts to explore the relationship(if any) between task structure and collaborative group interactions in a synchronous peer interaction collaborative learning environment. For this reason, we used the Cmap during a Physics course for Grade 12 students. This paper compares two groups of students, one studying concept maps with single answer task, and the other studying concept maps with variable answer task. The aim of the study presented in this article is to also investigate the influence of task structure on students' interactivity according to certain indicators and cognitive performance. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Objective: Tailored nutrition Web programs constitute an emerging trend in obesity prevention. Initial investment in innovative technology necessitates that the target population be well understood. This pilot study's purpose was to determine the feasibility of a workplace nutrition Web program. Design: Formative research was conducted with gaming industry employees and benefits managers to develop a consensus on workplace-specific nutrition needs. A demonstration Web program was piloted with stakeholders to determine feasibility. Setting: Indiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and New Jersey gaming establishments. Participants: 86 employees, 18 benefits managers. Intervention: Prototype Web program. Main Outcome Measures: Concept mapping; 16-item nutrition knowledge test; satisfaction. Analysis: Concept mapping was used to aggregate importance ratings on programmatic content, which informed Web program curriculum. Chi-square tests were performed postintervention to determine knowledge improvement. Results: (1) Employees and benefits managers exhibited moderate agreement about content priorities for the program (r = 0.48). (2) There was a significant increase in employees' nutrition knowledge scores postintervention (t = 7.16, df = 36, P < .001); those with less knowledge exhibited the greatest gains in knowledge scores (r = -0.647, P < .001). Conclusions and Implications: Employees and benefit managers do not necessarily agree on the priority of nutrition-related content, suggesting a need for programs to appeal to various stakeholders. Computer-based approaches can address various stakeholder health concerns via tailored, customized programming. © 2008 SOCIETY FOR NUTRITION EDUCATION.

AB  - HIV/AIDS poses grave risk to human development in sub-Saharan Africa. Evidence-based interventions that are rooted in local culture could help efforts to prevent threats to human development from HIV/AIDS. We used concept mapping (Concept System, 2006) to construct the components and content of a locally developed HIV/AIDS curriculum for use by secondary schools in Lusaka, Zambia. Participants were school counsellors (n=14), youth health program officers (n=7), and regular education teachers (n=3) from the education, health, and youth development agencies in Lusaka, Zambia (males=11; females=13; mean age 38; SD=15 years). Concept mapping yielded six statement clusters defining preliminary components of a locally grounded in-school HIV/AIDS prevention curriculum and the content items that define these components: (1) life skills education (18 items), (2) sexuality and reproductive health (10 items), (3) treatment, care and support (13 items), (4) counselling (12 items), (5) basic facts about HIV/AIDS (11 items), and (6) dissemination of information about HIV/AIDS (11 items). Zambian locally constructed constructs for an HIV/STD prevention curriculum overlap those promoted by public health programs in the country and internationally. © 2008 International Union of Psychological Science.

AB  - A concept map is a graphical representation of relationships among concepts. Willis and Miertschin suggested the use of technology-based concept mapping as an active learning strategy that can enhance learning and thinking skills, particularly among students native to a digital environment [16]. In addition, modern concept mapping software tools enable instructors and students to create visual navigation structures through complex knowledge domains. The authors find value in visual navigation structures for their relevance to organizing and simplifying learning environments and for their appeal to visual learners. This paper investigates different ways to develop digital interactive concept maps (CMaps) to help students navigate complex knowledge domains, such as the content of a course or a curriculum. CMaps can be used to present information in a nonsequential way or in several different ways, depending on the need. Interactivity enables students to easily locate digital information artifacts pertinent to a concept (media files, slide presentations, web pages, etc.) by clicking on links associated with a CMap node representing the course concept or category. A review of recent literature is provided, different software tools are compared, and the authors document their personal experience.

AB  - Measures of student learning are the only authentic indicators of the quality of teaching with technology. The paper will look at a number of frameworks for evaluating e-learning. It will outline some of the implications for using these frameworks to evaluate student learning and will describe the advantages of using concept mapping to measure the quality of e-learning. It will present a study where medical students interacted with e-learning materials designed to teach Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Their understanding of MRI was measured before and after the course by the use of concept mapping. The results show that many of the student misconceptions were addressed in the course of their learning, but also, that many of the key concepts introduced in the teaching were simply ignored (or sometimes learnt by rote) by the students. These must be acknowledged in the design of electronic teaching materials.

AB  - Nine 11th and 12th grade students from a large urban high school participated in a three-tiered program that charged them with the responsibility to be earth science mentors for 7th graders from a local feeder school. During Tier I, a three-month training period, these 11th and 12th graders worked closely with university-based scientists, science educators, and secondary science teachers to learn a tested curriculum on climate change and to prepare to be mentors. Prior to Tier I, four scientists involved in climate change research were asked to derive independently a list of concepts that they perceived to be most central to this topic. A concept mapping exercise was developed from their consensus and, both at the beginning and at the end of Tier I, student understandings were analyzed with concept maps and interviews. A baseline of 11th and 12th grade students' understandings of climate change is established and suggestions are made as to how these findings can inform instructional practices in the geosciences.

AB  - In this article, we argue for the importance of using concept maps in an advanced technical reading class offered for computer science students. This article presents a strong argument that use of concept maps should be inte grated effectively with traditional document conceptualization and production techniques. Assignments based on designing concept maps in a technical reading classroom should address the use of knowledge models like concept maps and should be integrated effectively with technical writing assignments. This study reports that readers think concept maps and the associated software are effective tools for comprehending technical details, and they prefer to use various strategies (when they are part of the class design) to dissect the technical text to be used in concept maps. Readers' self-reports also suggested that readers used concept maps for a variety of reasons. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the organizational structure of educational technology units within U.S. and Canadian medical schools in order to (1) identify organization models that support educational technology, (2) describe key attributes of these models, and (3) discuss the strengths and challenges associated with these models. METHOD: The authors distributed a survey to 88 schools that had previously provided information on their educational technology services and infrastructure. The authors developed the survey through a series of pilots and, then, from the data for each respondent school, created concept maps, which were used to identify organizational models. The authors conducted analyses to determine differences among models. The authors coded the comments about organizational models and identified themes. RESULTS: The authors received adequate data for analysis from 61 schools (69%). Four models for educational technology organizations emerged: (1) centralized units located in the school of medicine, (2) centralized units located at the health science center, (3) centralized units at the comprehensive university, and (4) no centralized unit (Dispersed Model). The majority (75%) of schools relied on some type of centralized organization. Whereas few organization attributes proved to be statistically significant, the centralized models have more resources devoted to educational technology and a closer alignment with the academic mission than the Dispersed Model. CONCLUSIONS: Medical schools primarily use central models. The authors recommend that schools structuring their educational technology resources consider exploration of a central model because of its focused use of resources to improve teaching and learning. © 2008 Association of American Medical Colleges.

AB  - This paper reports the use of quantitative and qualitative measures of university student learning during teaching in psychiatry. Concept mapping, pre-and post test scores and performance in written assignments were used to measure the quality of change in personal understanding and to show the ways that the knowledge-targets of the course were achieved. The data show that: (1) Concept mapping can be used to explore personal understanding because it facilitates discrete statements of meaning. (2) These personal statements can be compared through time to assess change. (3) Specific criteria can be used to measure the quality of the change from one statement to another so that the different qualities of change that occur can be made-visible in the course of teaching. The approach is discussed in the broader context of learning theory and teaching practice. We show in particular, that prior-knowledge is an important determinant of learning because it affects the sense that can be made of taught material. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Concept maps consist of nodes that represent concepts and links that represent relationships between concepts. Various studies have shown that concept mapping fosters meaningful learning. However, little is known about the specific cognitive processes that are responsible for such mapping effects. In a thinking-aloud study, we analyzed the relations between cognitive processes during concept mapping as well as the characteristics of the concept maps that the learners produced and learning outcomes (38 university students). To test whether differences in learning outcome are due to differences in general abilities, verbal and spatial abilities were also assessed. In a cluster-analysis two types of ineffective learners were identified: 'non-labeling mappers' and 'non-planning mappers'. Effective learners, in contrast, showed much effort in planning their mapping process and constructing a coherent concept map. These strategies were more evident in students with prior concept-mapping experience ('advanced beginners') than in those who had not used this learning strategy before ('successful beginners'). Based on the present findings, suggestions for a direct training approach (i.e., strategy training with worked-out examples) and an indirect training approach (i.e., supporting the learners with strategy prompts) were developed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Although researchers in higher education propose alternatives to traditional approaches to assessment, traditional methods are commonly used in college or university science courses. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility and validity of Prospective Science Teachers' (PSTs) concept maps as authentic assessment tools in a student-centred approach to describe the changes in the conceptual understanding of the PSTs in general chemistry laboratory investigations. After the PSTs (n = 47) decided on important issues, such as who would assess their concept maps and what scoring strategy and criteria would be used, they practiced assessing their own and peers' concept maps during the first five laboratory investigations. They subsequently constructed and assessed pre- and post-laboratory concept maps in a student-centred approach consisting of self, peer, and instructor assessments for the five remaining laboratory investigations. The results of the study showed using pre- and post-laboratory concept maps as authentic assessment tools in a student-centred approach was valid and reliable for describing the conceptual understanding of the PSTs in a university general chemistry laboratory course. The results of individual interviews indicated most PSTs had positive views of their assessment practices in the laboratory course. This study also provides pedagogical implications for the training of science teachers. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to show the search for an intelligent system for the teacher support in a meaningful teaching-learning process. As application domain, the authors have chosen the field of Computer memory hierarchy. This field has been chosen due to its limited complexity but it is sufficiently general to be learnt in several disciplines with different levels of detail. Moreover, in previous works the authors have implemented a highly configurable simulator for the teaching of this subject. In a first step, an action research process is carried out, looking for an improvement in the teaching process. As outcome, the design of an expert system is proposed, even independent of the domain field. This expert or intelligent system describes the subject to learn from a variation of conceptual map called Pedagogical Concept Instructional Graph, generated by the teacher. After that, the expert system makes use of an adaptive test, generating several questions that deal with those concepts included in the conceptual map with a hierarchical structure. From each student's answers, it can be obtained a personalized conceptual map describing what the student knows a priori about the subject to learn. © 2007 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - A concept map is a graphical representation of relationships among concepts. Willis and Miertschin suggested the use of technology-based concept mapping as an active learning strategy that can enhance learning and thinking skills, particularly among students native to a digital environment [16]. In addition, modern concept mapping software tools enable instructors and students to create visual navigation structures through complex knowledge domains. The authors find value in visual navigation structures for their relevance to organizing and simplifying learning environments and for their appeal to visual learners. This paper investigates different ways to develop digital interactive concept maps (CMaps) to help students navigate complex knowledge domains, such as the content of a course or a curriculum. CMaps can be used to present information in a nonsequential way or in several different ways, depending on the need. Interactivity enables students to easily locate digital information artifacts pertinent to a concept (media files, slide presentations, web pages, etc.) by clicking on links associated with a CMap node representing the course concept or category. A review of recent literature is provided, different software tools are compared, and the authors document their personal experience.

AB  - The use of present pedagogical methods and Information and Communication Technologies produce a new quality that favors the task of generating, transmitting and sharing knowledge. That is the case of the pedagogical effect that produces the use of the Concept Maps, which are considered a learning technique as a way to increase meaningful learning in the sciences. It is also used for the knowledge management as an aid to personalize the learning process, to exchange knowledge, and to learn how to learn. Concept Mapping provides a framework for making this internal knowledge explicit in a visual form that can easily be examined and shared. Concept Maps are relevant since they can be retrieved or adapted to new problems. In the other hand, Case-Based Reasoning as a technique in Artificial Intelligence plays an important role in knowledge retrieval and reuse of memories. In this paper the authors present a new approach to elaborate Intelligent Teaching/Learning Systems, where the techniques of Concept Maps and Artificial Intelligence are combined, using the Case-Based Reasoning as theoretical framework for the Student Model. The proposed model has been implemented in the computational system HESEI, which has been successfully used in the teaching/learning process by laymen in the Computer Science field.

AB  - Information technology students at universities have in general found difficulty in grasping object-oriented (OO) concepts. They have problems with abstract thinking, especially in the context of performing abstractions of real-world problems in object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) courses. Most of these students prefer to focus on the implementation phase of a software development lifecycle and consider the preceding analysis and design phases unnecessary. We present an approach to introduce the concept map as the first domain model to be derived from functional requirements or textual use cases during the analysis phase. It can subsequently evolve into a class diagram containing information on classes, attributes, associations, generalization-specialization hierarchies, aggregation and methods. This paper contains results of a quantitative evaluation for gauging the effectiveness of concept mapping in helping students with their abstraction techniques.

AB  - The use of pedagogical methods with the technologies of the information and communications produce a new quality that favors the task of generating, transmitting and sharing knowledge. Such is the case of the pedagogical effect that produces the use of the Concept Maps, which constitute a tool for the management of knowledge, an aid to personalize the learning process, to exchange knowledge, and to learn how to learn. Effective knowledge management maintains the knowledge assets of an organization by identifying and capturing useful information in a usable form, and by supporting refinement and reuse of that information in service of the organization's goals. Concept Mapping provides a framework for making this internal knowledge explicit in a visual form that can easily be examined and shared. However, it does not address how relevant Concept Maps can be retrieved or adapted to new problems. Case-Based Reasoning is playing an increasing role in knowledge retrieval and reuse for corporate memories, and its capabilities are appealing to augment the concept mapping process. In this paper the authors present a new approach to elaborate Intelligent Teaching-Learning Systems, where the techniques of concepts diagrams and Artificial Intelligence are combined, using the Case-Based Reasoning as theoretical framework for the Student Model.

AB  - The long-term goal of Project Halo is to build an application called Digital Aristotle that can answer questions on a wide variety of science topics and provide user- and domain-appropriate explanations. As a near-term goal, we are focusing on enabling subject matter experts (SMEs) to construct declarative knowledge bases (KBs) from 50 pages of a science textbook in the domains of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology in a way that the system can answer questions similar to those in an Advanced Placement (AP) exam in the respective discipline. The textbook knowledge is a mixture of textual information, mathematical equations, tables, diagrams, and domain-specific representations such as chemical reactions. In this paper, we explore the following question: Can we build a knowledge capture system to enable SMEs to construct KBs from the knowledge found in science textbooks and use the resulting KB for deductive question answering? We answer this question in the context of a system called AURA that supports knowledge capture from science textbooks. Copyright 2007 ACM.

AB  - Throughout their public school education, Japanese students are socialized into cultural learning practices [1] that emphasize group-oriented tasks. Well-organized group work is paramount to successful EFL teaching in Japan. In this paper, we look at how Moodle an open-source learning management system, is used at a Japanese computer science university to organize both individual and group tasks. Examples are provided of freeware and open-source software tools, such as CmapTools for concept mapping and Praat for acoustic analysis that can be used within Moodle to enhance EFL reading, writing, and pronunciation courses. We also explore how Moodle can be integrated with collaborative document production tools, such as Google Docs and Spreadsheets. Finally, we demonstrate the use of Moodle as a tool for action research, enabling the teacher/researcher to tightly control the course content in two different courses while systematically varying aspects of the content to test hypotheses about language learning. An important aspect of our work is the systematization of group process in language and communication courses and the development of a context for experimentation. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - This study aims at highlighting the collaborative activity of two high school students (age 14) in the cases of modeling the complex biological process of plant growth with two different tools: the 'paper & pencil' concept mapping technique and the computer-supported educational environment 'ModelsCreator'. Students' shared activity in both cases is carried out in the presence of a facilitator providing technical as well as cognitive support when necessary. The objective of the study is to highlight the ways in which the collaborating students are engaged in the plant growth modeling activity in the two cases and also identify the activity's similar and different aspects in each one. Our analysis is carried out on two complementary axes, the first of which concerns the process of collaboratively creating a plant growth model with each different tool, while the second has to do with the students' conceptualizations of the biological aspect of the modeling task in each case. A two-level analytic tool for the modeling process has been derived within the theoretical framework of 'activity theory' on the basis of the OCAF scheme for basic modeling operations and the scheme of Stratford et al. [Stratford, S. J., Krajcik, J., & Soloway, E. (1998). Secondary students' dynamic modeling processes: analyzing, reasoning about, synthesizing, and testing models of stream ecosystems. Journal of Science Education and Technology, 7(3), 215-234.] for higher-order modeling actions. According to our results, four major modeling actions (analysis, synthesis, testing-interpreting, technical and cognitive support) performed through a plethora of modeling operations define the steps of the modeling process in both cases, while specific qualitative differences can be actually identified. Finally, the students' conceptualizations of the biological aspect of the modeling task in the two-case activity is analyzed in regard with their capability of shifting reasoning between macro- and micro-levels, while educational implications are also discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bacterial conjugation is a genetic transfer that involves cell-to-cell between donor and recipient cells. With the current method used to teach students in genetic courses at the undergraduate level, the transconjugants are identified using bacterial physiology and/or antibiotic resistance. Using physiology, however, is difficult for both first-year undergraduates and special science students at the high school levels, who do not have the basic knowledge. We have developed a laboratory exercise that comprises a simple and rapid technique for transferring bacterial DNA by conjugation and examining the transconjuants using only antibiotic resistance on agar. The identity of the right transconjuants is confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. This exercise is designed to help students understand how horizontal gene transfer occurs in bacteria by conjugation using Escherichia coli as a hands-on learning model. Students should be able to draw concept maps of three DNA transfer methods on their own after carrying out the experiment and getting some additional information. © 2007 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

AB  - Background: The preparation of patients for bariatric surgery includes education concerning the intervention and its after-effects, and training on the health behaviors that they must put into practice after surgery. In this descriptive study, we have analyzed the cognitive structures of obese patients who have participated in a series of education sessions given by a medical team. Methods: 30 severely obese patients participated in an interview during which a concept map was drawn up. The concept maps were analyzed to describe the nature and organization of the patient's knowledge. Results: 10 knowledge domains have been identified concerning the intervention (principles, risks, follow-up care) and its consequences (weight, health, diet, social and psychological well-being, self-image, physical activity). Height domains were brought up by more than two-thirds of the patients. The knowledge organization is quite variable, as shown by the connections drawn between domains. Knowledge is mingled with other mental states in the cognitive structures of the patients. One-third of them expressed erroneous knowledge, especially concerning the surgical intervention and diet. The patients expressed numerous and positive perspectives on the expected change (81% of the mental states). Most concerned their quality of life. Nonetheless, 17 out of 30 patients also expressed themselves in a more negative fashion (12% of the mental states). Conclusion. This study shows the richness and diversity of the knowledge acquired by patients before a bariatric operation. It confirms the importance of education before surgery and the necessity of pursuing it as part of their long-term care. © 2007 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.

AB  - Pupils with autism often present significant challenges to teachers. They seem to have real strengths in visual processing but a cognitive style that encourages them to focus on detail rather than the overarching connections between concepts. Veronica Roberts, currently undertaking doctoral training at the Institute of Education, University of London, in order to become an educational psychologist, and Richard Joiner, senior lecturer in the Department of Psychology at the University of Bath, set out to explore these issues. In this article, they report the outcomes of a naturalistic experiment in which they investigated the utility of concept mapping as an educational strategy with pupils diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). Theoretical arguments supporting the use of concept mapping with an autistic population are outlined in the paper. A tutor group of ten pupils with ASD, aged between 11 and 14 years, took part in the study. Concept mapping tasks were integrated within National Curriculum science lessons in collaboration with the school's science teacher. The study found that the increase in pupil performance in subject-specific questionnaires was nearly four times greater in the concept mapping condition than after a more conventional teaching intervention. Veronica Roberts and Richard Joiner tentatively draw out the implications of their work for staff who work with pupils with ASD and make recommendations for further research into the use of these learning strategies. © 2007 Nasen.

AB  - Curriculum design is a concern in European Universities as they face the forthcoming European Higher Education Area (EHEA). This process can be eased by the use of scientific tools such as Concept-Mapping Techniques (CMT) that extract and organize the most relevant information from experts' experience using statistics techniques, and helps a working group to achieve conclusions. This paper presents an empirical exploratory research study related to the application of the CMT to the design of the Electronic Engineering (EE) Degree at the University of Seville, Spain. Considering the Career-space conclusions as the initial point, the main relevant competences were identified in a brainstorming technique. These competences are organized according to their affinity using CMT, establishing and interpreting the main clusters and their relative importance. Finally, a reliability analysis of the concept maps was carried out verifying the correctness of the procedure and validating the results for the curricula adaptation. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a group of elements to improve teaching and learning in technological education. These elements are based on some contributions issued from contemporary educational models, namely, the thematic approach, meaningful learning, concept maps, and the spiral curriculum. Based on a thematic approach, a new way is proposed to select the contents that will be explored in the educational process. We emphasize the benefits of a thematic approach in students' motivation. After contents are chosen, we propose the use of the directives of meaningful learning and concept maps, as a method and as a tool, respectively, to organize knowledge hierarchically, from general and inclusive concepts to specific ones. This may facilitate learning and understanding of the great bulk of knowledge to be dealt with during technological courses. A proposal has been submitted for a teaching module in computer networks and also for a complete course plan. The spiral curriculum was applied during the development of learning in the classroom, where some fundamental concepts were introduced many times over, adding more details gradually. A qualitative analysis of the application of these educational proposals, including learning evaluation aspects, is also presented. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - This article considers the impact of the early stages of an international project, Gardens for Life (GfL), on children's perceptions of school gardening and on their learning. The project involved 67 schools in England, Kenya and India and focused on the growing of crops, recognising the importance of both the process and product of this activity in the different countries. The theoretical framework was derived from consideration of informal learning, and more specifically experiential learning, drawing on prior research undertaken in the context of school gardening. The research approach is characterised by the use of concept maps to uncover the characteristically different ways in which children discerned school gardening and to help to provide insight into their understanding of this activity. It was supported by contextual observation, interviews and children's drawings to aid the interpretation and understanding. The study showed a positive impact on learning and on the perceptions of children towards school gardening in all three countries. It also highlighted the different perceptions, interpretations and understanding of school gardening in the different cultures and environments, as well as the various aspects of it which the children themselves highlighted. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - In information systems that support knowledge-discovery applications such as scientific exploration, reliance on highly structured ontologies as data-organization aids can be limiting. With current computational aids to science work, the human knowledge that creates meaning out of analyses is often only recorded when work reaches publication-or worse, left unrecorded altogether-for lack of an ontological model for scientific concepts that can capture knowledge as it is created and used. We argue for an approach to representing scientific concepts that reflects (1) the situated processes of science work, (2) the social construction of knowledge, and (3) the emergence and evolution of understanding over time. In this model, knowledge is the result of collaboration, negotiation, and manipulation by teams of researchers. Capturing the situations in which knowledge is created and used helps these collaborators discover areas of agreement and discord, while allowing individual inquirers to maintain different perspectives on the same information. The capture of provenance information allows historical trails of reasoning to be reconstructed, allowing end users to evaluate the utility and trustworthiness of knowledge representations. We present a proof-of-concept system, called Codex, based on this situated knowledge model. Codex supports visualization of knowledge structures through concept mapping, and enables inference across those structures. The proof-of-concept is deployed in the domain of geoscience to support distributed teams of learners and researchers. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, the Internet has become an effective and accessible delivery mechanism for distance education. In 2003, 81% of all institutions of higher education offered at least one fully online or hybrid course. By 2005, the proportion of institutions that listed online education as important to their long-term goals had increased by 8%. This growth in available online courses and their increased convenience and flexibility have stimulated dramatic increases in enrollment in online programs, including the Veterinary Technology Distance Learning Program (VT-DLP) at Purdue University. Regardless of the obvious benefits, distance learning (DL) can be frustrating for the learners if course developers are unable to merge their knowledge about the learners, the process of instructional design, and the appropriate uses of technology and interactivity options into effective course designs. This article describes strategies that we have used to increase students' learning of physiology content in an online environment. While some of these are similar, if not identical, to strategies that might be used in a face-to-face (f2f) environment (e.g., case studies, videos, concept maps), additional strategies (e.g., animations, virtual microscopy) are needed to replace or supplement what might normally occur in a f2f course. We describe how we have addressed students' need for instructional interaction, specifically in the context of two foundational physiology courses that occur early in the VT-DLP. Although the teaching and learning strategies we have used have led to increasingly high levels of interaction, there is an ongoing need to evaluate these strategies to determine their impact on students' learning of physiology content, their development of problem-solving skills, and their retention of information. © 2007 AAVMC.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify problems arisen by conventional curricula, the guidelines for development of an appropriate educational model for 21st century, and the advantages and disadvantages of the last two curricular models. The medical education literature published from 1995 through 2002 of four reputable journals in medical education were searched (Academic Medicine, Teaching and Learning in Medicine, Medical Education, and Medical Teacher). First the possibly best articles were identified. During the second screening process 76 of 180 articles were found to be highly relevant to our questions. A review of the chosen articles revealed a concept map which starts from currently applied hypothetical-deductive reasoning (HDR)-based curricula in many medical schools all around the world. Results revelaed that continuing cyclical process might be time consuming, enhance burden of faculty and might be stressful for students involved. Current issues in health care system are possibly attributable to current HDR-based curricular models including PBL. Advantages of reiterative PBL theory can not be denied, but it appears that its limited application should be mainly seen in some academic classes to develop some generic transferable skills simultaneously with other teaching methods. Therefore vast application of HDR in clinical settings is not recommended according to our study. However the relationships demonstrated between factors and outcomes mentioned in the concept map can be used to run some new studies to test some hypotheses. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Nursing education aims to help students understand concepts and gain competencies in holistic care. The purpose of this paper was to present a nursing curriculum that adapted and introduced holistic care into an adult nursing curriculum taught at a university of science and technology. The course framework included both holistic and nursing domains. The holistic aspect addressed client physical-psychological-spiritual needs and related factors, health related factors, and the status of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and related factors. The nursing aspect addressed the way in which nursing was applied to identify client problems and provide individualized, integrated and continuous care in hospital, family or community based settings employing primary, secondary, or tertiary prevention. Scenario with problem based learning and concept mapping were used in class to guide students to consider in depth the concepts that underpin holistic care.

AB  - Emerging from a human constructivist view of learning and a punctuated model of conceptual change, these studies explored differences in the structural complexity and content validity of knowledge about prehistoric life depicted in concept maps by learners ranging in age from approximately 10 to 20 years. Study 1 (cross-age) explored the frequencies of concepts, relationships, levels of hierarchy, branching, and cross-links in concept maps drawn by students in grades 5, 8, 11, 13, and 14. The results provide some support for a punctuated model of conceptual change. Study 2 (longitudinal) explored the same frequencies on repeated occasions among students enrolled in a college course on prehistoric life, and documented the shift in frequencies of "novice" and "expert" concepts occurring during the semester. The results suggest that college students engage in much restructuring of their knowledge frameworks during the period of a semester. Together, the two studies raise questions about common classroom practices that encourage the rote learning of biology and geology concepts at all levels. © 2006 National Science Council.

AB  - In this study, the effects of concept mapping on the preservice elementary teachers' achievement, conceptual understanding, anxiety toward science, and science teaching efficacy belief were investigated in the undergraduate general chemistry course. The aptitude-treatment interaction (ATI) between preservice teachers' learning approach and concept mapping strategy was also investigated. Sixty-nine freshmen from a university of education were assigned to a control group and a treatment group. Tests regarding students' learning approach, anxiety toward science, and science teaching efficacy belief were administered as pretests. Treatment lasted for 9 weeks. In every class, students in the treatment group constructed concept maps, while those in the control group solved the problems of the textbook after the lecture. After the instructions, tests of achievement, conceptual understanding, anxiety toward science, and science teaching efficacy beliefs were administered. The results indicated that students in the treatment group significantly outperformed those of the control group in the achievement test. In the conceptual understanding and the science teaching efficacy beliefs, however, no statistically significant differences were found between two groups. Students of the treatment group showed significantly higher anxiety than their counterpart in the test of anxiety toward science. No aptitude-treatment interaction between students' learning approach and the concept mapping strategy was found.

AB  - Change and complexity are creating a need for increasing levels of literacy in science and technology. Presently, we are beginning to provide students with clear contexts in which to learn, including clearly written text, visual displays and maps, and more effective instruction. We are also beginning to give students tools that promote their own literacy by helping them to interact with the learning context. These tools include peer-group skills as well as strategies to analyze text and to indicate comprehension by way of text summaries and concept maps. Even with these tools, more appears to be needed. Disparate backgrounds and languages interfere with the comprehension and the sharing of knowledge. To meet this need, two new tools are proposed. The first tool fractures language ontologically, giving all learners who use it a language to talk about what has, and what has not, been uttered in text or talk about the world. The second fractures language epistemologically, giving those involved in working with text or on the world around them a way to talk about what they have done and what remains to be done. Together, these tools operate as a two- tiered knowledge representation of knowledge. This representation promotes both an individual meta-cognitive and a social meta-cognitive approach to what is known and to what is not known, both ontologically and epistemologically. Two hypotheses guide the presentation: If the tools are taught during early childhood, children will be prepared to master science and technology content. If the tools are used by both students and those who design and deliver instruction, the learning of such content will be accelerated. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.

AB  - Inscriptions are central to the practice of science. Previous studies showed, however, that preservice teachers even those with undergraduate degrees in science, generally do not spontaneously produce inscriptions thai economically summarize large amounts of data. This study was designed to investigate the production of inscription while a group of 15 graduate-level preservice science teachers engaged in a 15-week course of scientific observation and guided inquiry of two organisms. The course emphasized the production of inscriptions as a way of convincingly supporting claims when the students presented their results. With continuing emphasis on inscriptional representations, we observed a significant increase in the number and type of representations made as the course unfolded. The number of concrete, text-based inscriptions decreased as the number of graphs, tables and other sorts of complex inscriptions increased. As the students moved from purely observational activities to guided inquiry, they made many more transformations of their data into complex and abstract forms, such as graphs and concept maps. The participants' competencies to cross-reference ultimate transformations to initial research questions improved slightly. Our study has implications for the traditional methods by which preservice science teachers are taught in their science classes. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Literature on science conceptions research and field investigations was used to probe alternative conceptions of primary school pupils. Theoretical studies from the literature have shown that there are many emphases on the physical meaning and the effects drawn by philosophers of science leading to the formation of new paradigms concerning science conceptions research. Our focus on primary school pupils' alternative conceptions pertaining to batteries (ACCB), in six phases, was to (1) analyse the context regarding batteries present in primary school; (2) summarize propositional statements and develop a target concept map on batteries; (3) edit protocols for interviews; (4) collect and analyse pupils' ACCB; (5) use the results from phases (1)-(4) to construct a two-tier diagnostic instrument; and (6) submit our instrument with others to carry out tests in a National Science Concept Learning Study (NSCLS). Interview results from 21 primary school pupils show that the characteristics of their ACCB can be categorized into several conceptual models related to language, learning processes, and public media. From the NSCLS, two-tier test data depict the ACCB of the primary school pupils in Taiwan. Many alternative conceptions are significantly related to language and daily life in Taiwan. ACCB in this research can be categorized as either content free or content specific. Conception models based on content free and content specific are presented according to the properties of the ACCB. Our joint venture on concept formation research has been affected by the four temporal paradigms formed at certain prominent historical landmarks in science conceptions research. Our data also show a degree of general similarity with existing literature on science conceptions research.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of using the cooperative concept mapping (CCM) teaching approach on secondary school students' motivation in biology. A non equivalent control group design under the quasi-experimental research was used in which a random sample of four co-educational secondary schools was used. The four schools were randomly assigned to four groups. Each school provided one Form Two class. The study sample comprised of 156 second grade students in the secondary school cycle (Form Two students) in Gucha District, Kenya. Students in all the groups were taught the same biology content but two groups, the experimental groups, were taught using the CCM approach while the other two, the control groups, were taught using regular teaching methods. Two groups, one experimental and one control, were pre-tested prior to the implementation of the CCM intervention. After four weeks, all four groups were post-tested using the students motivation questionnaire (SMQ). Data were analysed using the t-test, ANOVA and ANCOVA. The results show that students exposed to the CCM approach have significantly higher motivation than those taught through regular methods. The results further indicate that there is no statistically significant gender difference in motivation towards the learning of biology among secondary school students exposed to CCM.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore teachers' growth in understanding of algebra using concept maps. The study was set in the context of a five-year National Science Foundation funded teacher retention and renewal professional development project. In this project both beginning and experienced teachers are supported as they increase their understanding about mathematics, their ability to implement effective mathematics practices in their classrooms, and their knowledge of working with English Learners. Results indicate that teachers' algebraic knowledge structures became more complex and connected as a result of their professional development. In addition, they were able to adapt their knowledge networks to incorporate important aspects of algebra into them. Concept maps are recommended to other leaders of mathematics professional development as a means of assessing change. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.

AB  - The abilities of the improvement of creative attitude, the power of aesthetical and practical estimations, productivity and thinking with assets are acquired in the courses of art education in the primary schools. Also students are able to find self-expressing and self-identy opportinities in these courses. The art education in the primary schools constitutes one of the most difficult fields to learn and instruct. There are two main viewpoints in the art education. One of them is education education by means applied model arising by visual components, an affective and sensitive experience. The other is mental and conceptual weighted model. The instruction of mental and conceptual weighted lessons of art education in the primary schools is consist of art historical, aesthical and critical field subjects. It is thought that there are inadequacies on effective and sufficient instraction of art historical, aesthetical and critical field subjects. Sufficient and effectiveness of mind-maps on learning must be studied. The main purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the use of mind-maps on the courses of art education in the primary schools. 7th grade students in the primary schools in the academic year of 2006-2007 constitute the universe of the study. 68 students in 7/A and 7/B of Kazim Karabekir Primary School, the county of Eskisehir constitutes the sample of the study. Pre-test/post-test control model was used in this study and data were collected from the sample of the study by an oversee-test. The knowledge of students related to trends of modern art subject in the scope of art history was measured by this test including 30 questions. After pre-test and post-test points of the experiment and control groups were acquired, the average points and standard deviation were computed, "t test" was used on the comparasons between the groups and 0.05 confidence degree was taken as the significant degree. "SPSS 11 for Winows" software was used in all statistical analysis.

AB  - This paper assesses the usefulness of concept mapping (an educational learning, assessment, and curriculum development technique developed by Novak, widely used in the natural sciences) within an accounting education context. It shows how an accounting-based concept map can be constructed by students and educators to provide a visual, conceptually transparent graphical representation of an individual's understanding of a particular knowledge domain. The method is firmly routed in Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning and its emphasis upon the hierarchical structure of concepts is particularly relevant to accounting. While concept mapping has been used extensively in many (particularly science) disciplines, it has received relatively little attention within accounting education. The paper's contribution is to extend its application within an accounting education context by focusing upon how concept mapping can enhance students' learning by evaluating student-prepared concept maps, showing how concept mapping can be used at different levels within a course (i.e. curriculum, topic and activity) and reporting feedback of its use with two cohorts of students, within a financial accounting theory component. The use of educator-prepared concept maps, with concepts omitted, proved popular as tutorial quiz exercises and increased the quantity and quality of participation. However, students were less willing to construct their own concept maps and engage in meaningful learning. While most students were able to build upon aspects of their prior knowledge, stronger students used a greater range of concepts, a richer set of linkages and more examples than weaker students did. Concept maps were useful in diagnosing students' and instructors' misconceptions. Many students found concept mapping relatively easy to use, provided a better understanding of complex issues, liked the visual representation and holistic view, and so supported their learning. However, educators need to become proficient in constructing maps and using appropriate software, not make the maps too complex, provide students with some initial training in the technique and consider the fit between using the techniques as a learning tool and as an assessment tool. While no significant differences were found in the usefulness of the method for students of different ages and gender, Asian students generally found the method to be more useful than did UK students. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Engaging end-users effectively in the construction process is becoming increasingly important in the UK. However, this engagement is often hindered by the amount and complexity of information and knowledge that needs to be communicated among project stakeholders. This can often create a ‘mismatch’ between stakeholders’ expectations and the physical building constructed. A survey was carried out in two secondary schools in the North West of the UK to determine whether a ‘mismatch’ existed. An nD-based computer game was suggested to address this mismatch, the rubrics of which aimed to facilitate the early engagement of endusers in the construction process by providing ‘what-if’ analysis through visually shareable information. This approach was regarded as a self-learning tool, through which end-users could learn about the complexity of the construction process and the decisions and trade-offs being made. This research targeted school children (aged 11–16) as the end-users, under the Building Schools for the Future initiative funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. In order to simplify the information communicated to school children, a concept map was developed to identify the interrelationship between the nD concept, the gaming technology concept and the school building design concept. These interrelationships were used to inform the secondary phase of this research (unreported) which will be the actual development of the computer game. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study documents the effects of a scientific fieldwork-based model of instruction on enhancing pedagogical-content knowledge of in-service teachers engaged in an NSF-funded, three-year professional development program for earth/environmental teachers entitled Earth-View (ESI-9911850). We focused on data collected through concept maps and videotaped interviews that dealt specifically with the two areas of participant knowledge germane to enhancing PCK (i.e. content and pedagogical). The videotaped interviews were used to examine how the structure of the program (i.e. specifically, scientific fieldwork) facilitated the development of PCK in the context of instruction designed to increase content and pedagogical knowledge. The concept map evidence supports the assertion that the treatment experienced by Earth-View participants promotes construction of earth/environmental science content knowledge. We also demonstrate the capacity of the program activities (i.e. primarily scientific fieldwork) to promote pedagogical and pedagogical-content knowledge.

AB  - The use of present pedagogical methods with Information and Communication Technologies produce a new quality that favors the task of generating, transmitting and sharing knowledge. That is the case of the pedagogical effect that produces the use of the Concept Maps, which are considered a learning technique as a way to increase meaningful learning in the sciences. It is also used for the knowledge management as an aid to personalize the Teaching-Learning process, to exchange knowledge, and to learn how to learn. Concept Maps provides a framework for making this internal knowledge explicit in a visual form that can easily be examined and shared. In this paper the authors present two different approaches to elaborate Intelligent Teaching-Learning Systems, in each approach Concept Maps and Artificial Intelligence are combined, using in the first one the Case-Based Reasoning and in the other Bayesian Networks as a knowledge representation forms and inference mechanisms for the decision making, supporting the Student Model. The authors also show the facilities and the difficulties they had using each Artificial Intelligence technique combined with Concept Maps. The proposed models have been implemented in the computational systems HESEI and MacBay, whose have been successfully used in the Teaching-Learning process by laymen in the Computer Science field to generate them owns adaptive systems. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Five eighth grade science classes of students in at a middle school were assigned to three treatment groups: those who individually concept mapped, those who collaboratively concept mapped, and those who independently used their study time. The findings revealed that individually generating concept maps on computers during study time positively influenced science concept learning above and beyond independent use of study time, but that collaboratively generating concept maps did not. Students in both individual and collaborative concept mapping groups had positive attitudes toward concept mapping using Inspiration software. However, students in the collaborative concept mapping group did not like working in a group. This study contributes to the limited body of knowledge concerning the comparative effectiveness of individually and collaboratively-generating concept maps on computers for learning. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).

AB  - Middle and high-school science teachers have traditionally introduced current events in the classroom to leverage news topics relevant to the curriculum, such as the Sumatra Tsunami or Hurricane Katrina. SciNews Online is an online research environment co-designed with science teachers for learners to construct web reports on the science behind the news on natural disasters. Writing scientific explanations provides valuable learning opportunities for learners to engage in a realistic and educationally relevant science task. Here I highlight the design of the Scientific Explanation Activity, a scaffolded environment that supports learners. construction of scientific explanations using multiple online sources. The Scientific Explanation Activity focuses on supporting the development of key information literacy skills for sense-making in science inquiry, namely information integration across sources and effective scientific argumentation.

AB  - Concept mapping is a teaching and learning tool that is especially suited for science-based instruction. This article describes concept mapping as a tool for course evaluation in a fourth-year undergraduate Wellness course in a Health Studies Department. Pre-lecture and post-lecture concept maps describing wellness were compared on the basis of the degree of complexity of the diagram and the relationships among the various parameters. The post-lecture maps showed significantly more detail than did the pre-lecture maps, and the complexity of the post-lecture maps provided evidence that the students had a clearer understanding of all wellness parameters. Compared with a traditional course survey, this method detailed what information was important to students in their understanding of the course material and provided meaningful feedback on material that required greater emphasis in the course. Further research into the use of concept mapping to refine evaluative criteria and provide effective teaching is recommended.

AB  - The purpose of this research project was to determine the effects of incorporating concept mapping on the achievement of fifth grade students in science class. The study was conducted with twenty-three students at Ata Elementary School, Trabzon, Turkey. The students were tested with teacher-constructed pre- and post tests containing 20 multiple-choice questions. The pupils in the experimental and control groups were exposed to the same teaching techniques covering a unit on heat and temperature. They were given the same pretest after the initial lessons. However, after the pretest, the control group was given a traditional oral review of the material and the experimental group was exposed to the review by the use of Inspiration, which is computer based concept mapping tool. After these reviews, the students on both groups were given the posttest. Test scores were analyzed for any statistically significantly difference in the scores on the test. The results from present study indicate that concept mapping has a noticeable impact on student achievement in science classes. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).

AB  - Teachers always want to know how much their students had learned in classes. The most convenient way to discover learning status is 'test'. Each item on a test sheet always contains one or more concepts used to check whether a student really understands or not. Teachers can also And a student's misconceptions out via the concept relations stored in a test sheet. In order to make the diagnosis process simple, teachers always take concept maps as their test development and learning diagnosis tools. This paper implements a SCORM/IMS compliance online test and diagnosis system base on concept maps. In the system, it has more than 5000 members and generates real-time learning report for misconception diagnosis over 500 times monthly. The members are the third-year student at junior high school and come from different counties and cities all over the country. Currently, the system covers 11 courses such as Chinese, English, Physics, History, and Earth Science. It's obviously the system is useful for both teachers and students. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - In this study with 46 young adults, we investigated effects of differently structured concept maps for students' comprehension of science texts and for their self-construction of concept maps in a new domain. We assumed that a balance of self-construction and structuring would direct learners' attention to both content relations and affordances and constraints of the strategy of concept mapping. In the first phase of the investigation, learners either constructed concept maps themselves from texts, worked with fill-in-the-gap concept maps, or used expert concept maps for text comprehension. In the second phase, participants of all groups constructed concept maps in a new domain. As hypothesized, the structural support in expert concept maps and fill-in-the-gap concept maps especially furthered content understanding, whereas for the application of the strategy of concept mapping, the active construction either with fill-in-the-gap concept maps or with self-constructed concept maps was especially important. A balance of self-construction and structural support, as given in the fill-in-the-gap concept map, thus led to a focusing of students' attention on both represented content and affordances and constraints of the visualization strategy. © 2006 Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG.

AB  - A research program at Cornell University that sought to study the ability of children to acquire science concepts and the effect of this learning on later schooling led to the need for a new tool to describe explicit changes in children's conceptual understanding. Concept mapping was invented in 1972 to meet this need, and subsequently numerous other uses have been found for this tool. Underlying the research program and the development of the concept mapping tool was an explicit cognitive psychology of learning and an explicit constructivist epistemology. In 1987, collaboration began between Novak and Cãas and others at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, then part of the University of West Florida. Extending the use of concept mapping to other applications such as the integration of concept mapping with the World Wide Web (WWW) led to the development of software that enhanced the potential of concept mapping, evolving into the current version of CmapTools now used worldwide in schools, universities, corporations, and governmental and non-governmental agencies. Differences between concept maps and other knowledge representation tools are described. The integration of concept mapping software programs with the WWW and other new technologies permits a new kind of concept map-centred learning environment wherein learners build their own knowledge models, individually or collaboratively, and these can serve as a basis for life-long meaningful learning. Combined with other educational practices, use of CmapTools permits a New Model for Education. Preliminary studies are underway to assess the possibilities of this New Model. © 2006 Palgrave Macmillan Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Contemporary assessment practices in science education have undergone significant changes in recent decades, The basis for these changes and the resulting new assessment practices are the subject of this two-part paper. Part 1 considers the basis of assessment that, more than 25 years ago, was driven by the assumptions of decomposability and decontextualization of knowledge, resulting in a low-inference testing system, often described as "traditional." This assessment model was replaced not on account of direct criticism, but rather on account of a larger revolution-the change from behavioral to cognitive psychology, developments in the philosophy of science, and the rise of constructivism. Most notably, the study of the active cognitive processes of the individual resulted in a major emphasis on context in learning and assessment. These changes gave rise to the development of various contextual assessment methodologies in science education, for example, concept mapping assessment, performance assessment, and portfolio assessment. In Part 2, the literature relating to the assessment methods identified in Part 1 is reviewed, revealing that there is not much research that supports their validity and reliability. However, encouraging new work on selected-response tests is forming the basis for reconsideration of past criticisms of this technique. Despite the major developments in contextual assessment methodologies in science education, two important questions remain unanswered, namely, whether grades can be considered as genuine numeric quantities and whether the individual student is the appropriate unit of assessment in public accountability. Given these issues and the requirement for science assessment to satisfy the goals of the individual, the classroom, and the society, tentative recommendations are put forward addressing these parallel needs in the assessment of science learning. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals.

AB  - Researching self-regulated learning (SRL) as a process that evolves across multiple episodes of studying poses large methodological challenges. While self-report data provide useful information about learners' perceptions of learning, these data are not reliable indicators of studying tactics learners actually use while studying, especially when learners are young children. We argue that self-reports about SRL need to be augmented by fine-grained traces that are records of learners' actual activities as they study. We describe how gStudy software unobtrusively collects detailed trace data about learners' use of study tactics as they engage with content presented in learning kits-collections of documents (e.g., texts, graphics, video clips) and tasks (e.g., notes, concept maps) on which learners operate to study. We suggest that trace data can advance research about how learners select, monitor, assemble, rehearse, and translate information to learn it, and provide raw materials for mapping SRL and its effects. Examples from the Life Cycles Learning Kit that supports grade 1 students learning about the life cycles of humans and frogs are given. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.

AB  - Nurse educators, under pressure to prepare graduates who are able to think critically and solve problems in a variety of clinical practice settings, require active teaching strategies to promote meaningful learning, instead of relying on traditional methods that promote rote memorization. A review of the current state of the science with regard to concept mapping demonstrates that this teaching-learning method assists nurse educators to prepare graduates to think critically in the complex health care environment. However, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of concept mapping on the graduate's performance on the NCLEX exam and on critical thinking and prioritization skills in the clinical environment.

AB  - We are developing Companion Cognitive Systems, a new kind of software that can be effectively treated as a collaborator. Aside from their potential utility, we believe this effort is important because it focuses on three key problems that must be solved to achieve human-level AI: Robust reasoning and learning, interactivity, and longevity. We describe the ideas we are using to develop the first architecture for Companions: analogical processing, grounded in cognitive science for reasoning and learning, sketching and concept maps to improve interactivity, and a distributed agent architecture hosted on a cluster to achieve performance and longevity. We outline some results on learning by accumulating examples derived from our first experimental version. Copyright © 2006, American Association for Artificial Intelligence. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pre-prepared concept maps that organise knowledge in a non-linear fashion appeal to a variety of cognitive learning styles and may thus represent an educational tool that supports 'teaching to all types'. However, another central cognitive factor, learning approach, may have a bearing on student take-up of this learning resource. Student attitudes to pre-prepared concept maps introduced in Stage 2 MPharm and BSc Pharmacology lectures were therefore examined in relation to the principal learning orientations according to Duff's 30-item revised approaches to study inventory (RASI). Approximately one half of students (49.6 ± 4.5%) reported pre-prepared concept maps to be useful to their learning (n = 121). When preferred learning approach was examined, derived from the highest RASI score per individual and excluding ties, 31.9 ± 4.3%, 29.3 ± 4.2% and 38.8 ± 4.5% of students demonstrated a preference for the deep approach (DA), strategic approach (STA) and surface approach (SUA), respectively (P &gt; 0.05, χ2 goodness-of-fit test, n = 116). There was a weak but statistically significant association between preferred learning approach identified by Duff's 30-item RASI and the self-reported usefulness of concept maps (P &gt; 0.05, χ2 test of independence; Cramer's V=0.235; lambda=0.193). In contrast, gender was not significantly associated with attitude to concept maps i n this student cohort. A preliminary analysis of standardised residuals based on observed and expected frequencies revealed that the greatest contributions to this significant association were: A positive influence of DA and a negative influence of STA, respec tively, on attitude to concept maps. These data now indicate a contribution of the principal learning orientations vis-à-vis student attitudes to pre-prepared concept maps when employed alongside more traditional teaching/learning activities in medical and bi omedical science education, and may further suggest a role for concept maps in the support of deep learning. © 2006 Taylor &amp; Francis.

AB  - This study investigated the score exchangeability of concept maps with problem-solving essays. Of interest was whether sixth-grade students’ concept maps predicted their scores on essay responses that used concept map content. Concept maps were hypothesized to be alternatives to performance assessments for content-area domain knowledge in science. Both special (n = 16) and general (n = 16) education students participated in a science unit that covered three ecosystem cycles: (a) the water cycle, (b) the nitrogen cycle, and (c) the carbon dioxide-oxygen cycle. Assessment tasks required students to draw three concept maps and respond to two essay questions. Results showed that concept maps and essay tasks lacked consistent exchangeability. Findings indicated low predictive validity between map scores and essay scores and, thus, maps should not be considered alternative content-area domain assessments. © 2006, Sage Publications.

AB  - This article analyzes the concept map as a tool for educational strategy applied to health sciences, particularly in the area of histology. After considering the elements that make up these maps, the different types of concept maps and the epistemological basis of maps as instruments to enhance significant learning, the article examines how maps can be used for curriculum development, evaluation, pedagogic design by teachers, and self-learning by students within the context of the Bologna process. With reference to histology, we analyze how different types of maps are used to define and rank concepts, examine the relationship between disciplines and to understand the new paradigm of histology related to tissue engineering.

Strand maps are a special kind of concept maps that contains interconnected learning goals organized along grade groups and topical strands. The Strand Map Service provides programmatic access to AAAS strand maps that can be used by educational digital libraries to dynamically build resource discovery interfaces. The programmatic access to strand maps is enabled by the Concept Space Interchange Protocol, which provide following services (1) service capability determination, (2) resource alignment, and (3) search and retrieval of dynamically generated strand maps. The protocol is implemented as a web service and integration experiments have been performed for two educational digital libraries.

AB  - This meta-analysis reviews experimental and quasi-experimental studies in which students learned by constructing, modifying, or viewing node-link diagrams. Following an exhaustive search for studies meeting specified design criteria, 67 standardized mean difference effect sizes were extracted from 55 studies involving 5,818 participants. Students at levels ranging from Grade 4 to postsecondary used concept maps to learn in domains such as science, psychology, statistics, and nursing. Posttests measured recall and transfer. Across several instructional conditions, settings, and methodological features, the use of concept maps was associated with increased knowledge retention. Mean effect sizes varied from small to large depending on how concept maps were used and on the type of comparison treatment. Significant heterogeneity was found in most subsets.

AB  - Nowadays the European Universities are worried about how to adapt higher education to the new European Higher Education Area, as proposed in the Bologna Magna Charta Universitatum of 1998, and signed by 32 European Education Ministers. One of the key points in this higher education reform was the introduction of new Master's level curricula. These Masters will look for the professional specialization and they will have to be adapted to the specific skills demanded by the society. This paper presents the results from a cooperation project - funded by the AECI (International Cooperation Spanish Agency) and developed between the University of Seville (Spain) and the Catholic University of Asuncion (Paraguay) - by about the planning of a new master's level curriculum in digital signal processing (DSP) area, taking into account the Bologna principles and the conclusions obtained by the Career Space Consortium. A scientific method from social science, known as concept mapping techniques, was used to perform this planning. Basically, the idea of concept mapping consists of compiling the opinion from actors belonging to different environments (lecturers, researchers, workers, businessmen, etc.) related to DSP applications. The compiled data were statistically computed to cluster the opinions of the different agents. The result will be a master's level curricula adapted to the environment requirements and the social settings. © Springer 2006.

AB  - Mixed methods were adopted to explore the effects of student-generated visualization on paper and on computers as a study strategy for middle school science concept learning. In a post-test-only-control-group design, scores were compared among a control-group (n=28), a group that was trained to visualize on paper (n=30), and a group that was trained to visualize on computers (n=34). The paper group and the computer group performed significantly better on the post-test than the control group. Visualization as a study strategy had positive effects whether students used paper or computers to generate their visualizations. However, no significant difference existed between the paper group and the computer group's scores. Qualitative results indicated that students who were trained to visualize on paper or on computers had positive attitudes toward the use of visualization as a study strategy, and they engaged more in purposeful tasks during study time than the control group. However, several participants in the computer group felt negatively about the use of visualization; they claimed that visualization demanded too much time and effort. Attitudes toward visualization as a study strategy differed within groups indicating that visualization might interact with learner characteristics.

AB  - The development of semantic networking and concept mapping has interesting parallels and important distinctions. They both have a substantial research base demonstrating their effectiveness as research and metacognitive tools. While grid systems for drawing structures may be familiar to the engineer and the artist, they have also been demonstrated to be useful in biology education. Roundhouse diagrams are named after the circular buildings with central turntables that are used by railroads for housing and switching locomotives. Another graphic metacognitive tool is Gowin's epistemological vee. Otherwise known as a vee diagram, this graphic allows one to view the actual activities of science as it moves from events to data collection to data transformations to knowledge claims to values claims as a research project is being planned or completed. Concept mapping requires an understanding of what a concept entails and promotes the ability to use concepts as the basis of scientific language. Concept mapping requires the map designer to prioritize and make judicious use of selected concepts when mapping. This may well serve proponents of science education reform who advocate. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This chapter identifies some ideas, including cautionary notes, on assessment that should be considered by those interested in translating school science standards into measures that can be used by classroom teachers and others to assess student understanding of science concepts and the nature of science itself. In school science, one of the difficulties of equating understanding to problem solving is to know when a problem is really a problem, rather than a recall-of-algorithm exercise for a given student. Conceptual understanding in science involves more than algorithmic expertise. The main assumption behind concept mapping as an assessment tool is that expertise or understanding can be assessed by asking a person to construct a map by relating concepts in a hierarchical structure using propositional statements such as is regulated by and results in as the links or connections. Problem solving and concept mapping represent important kinds of tests or assessment tools for judging how well someone understands science concepts. Each tool seems to tap an important feature of what it means to understand, although it is clear that problem solving is seen by most scientists and members of Nobel Prize committees as the ultimate test. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This chapter focuses on the importance of concept maps for effectively teaching science students. Students who learn meaningfully relate information from different sources in an attempt to integrate what they learn with the intention of imposing meaning. They form connections between new information and material that has been previously studied, and they think about the underlying structure of what is learned. Concept maps have been particularly helpful in representing qualitative aspects of students' learning. They may also be used by students as a study tool or by teachers to evaluate learning, enhance teaching, or facilitate curriculum planning. Concept mapping is a tool for representing the interrelationships among concepts in an integrated, hierarchical manner. Concept maps depict the structure of knowledge in propositional statements that dictate the relationships among the concepts in a map. Concept maps provide a useful approach for promoting and assessing meaningful learning by providing a tangible record of conceptual understanding. Not only are concept maps useful for determining whether, or to what extent, shared meaning has occurred, but they also portray the areas where it has not been achieved. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Qualitative concept maps are useful for sharing the structure of a domain and for assessing students' understanding. While concept maps made from links and nodes depict static causal relationships between concepts quite well, they provide little support for displaying conditional logic and thresholds for causation. In this paper, we describe the process of incorporating a representation for conditional reasoning into Betty, a computer agent students teach via concept maps. Betty helps students formalize their knowledge of a domain by acting as a novice learner. Students use Betty to construct and assess their knowledge of science topics. We tested several prototypes combining conditional logic with concept maps and found that people had difficulty keeping conditional states and conceptual nodes separate. In the end, the Unless Switch provided the closest semantic parallel to the type of reasoning we wanted students to learn and generated the least amount of confusion.

AB  - In this paper we critically review and analyze previous research on collaborative concept mapping in both face-to-face and networked environments. Although research has shown the positive effects of collaborative concept mapping on learning in face-to-face learning environments, there is a dearth of research which specifically focuses on the potential value of adopting collaborative concept mapping in online learning environments. Newly developed concept mapping software which operates via the Internet makes it possible for distance learners to implement concept mapping as a learning tool for coconstructing knowledge. Using our analysis of current research we provide some directions for future research in the use of concept mapping for online learning. © 2005 international Society of the Learning sciences.

AB  - This chapter presents a view of assessment in science education that departs significantly from the traditional "selecting and sorting" model that has become standard fare in the schools. The value of application tasks and problem sets has been recognized by generations of teachers, especially in knowledge domains such as physics, chemistry, and genetics. Novel problems that require a rationale or justification are clearly among the most valuable of these methods. Unfortunately, in the hands of less-experienced science teachers, problems and applications often become an exercise in memorizing a solution path or a simple algorithm. By way of comparison, an assessment strategy that depends on the longitudinal construction of concept maps along with structured, clinical interviews seems to offer a readily accessible way of tapping into both understanding and conceptual change. Another approach that offers similar advantages is the iterative construction of classroom artifacts. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we describe the development of an interactive learning environment that can be used to improve educational outcomes by engaging users during the learning process. The system adopts a problem solving-based pedagogical technique and allows users to learn about a subject area by utilizing a concept map-based knowledge model. We also discuss the role of such a system in the introductory computer science curriculum and describe a plan for using this system in the introductory programming course at our institution.

AB  - The University of South Alabama has for an extended period of time been committed to improving the introductory programming course for Computer Science. These efforts and their results have been supported by the National Science Foundation, assessed by numerous instruments, and have been disseminated in papers, workshops, and conference sessions. Specific topics of this dissemination have included the integration of lecture and laboratory experiences, the use of motivational strategies and affective objectives, student achievement and retention, the early use of professional practices in the curriculum, the development of student affect during the introductory course, the enhancement of laboratory experiences, the application of various learning theories in the classroom, and curriculum design. In contrast to these prior works which each focused on just a few specific issues, the purpose of this paper is to holistically discuss the set of effective strategies used in our introductory programming course and show how these diverse efforts can be melded together and jointly enhance and enliven the course. This set of strategies includes the integration of cognitive and affective course objectives; the use of concept maps and other visual instructional techniques and tools; the use of motivational strategies such as classroom discussion and student self-reflection; the integration of conceptual development and hands-on exercises in the classroom; the designing of course progress to match the students' zone of proximal development; the designing of course delivery methodologies to match the diversity of students' interests and learning styles; the inclusion of diverse strategies to integrate the "real world" into every component of the course; the strategic use of student surveys; and the integration of professional practices and student commitments to quality. A marked, consistent, and significant increase in student course completion rates has accompanied our implementation of these strategies. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - The challenge of developing a better Chemical Engineering Curriculum, or any Engineering curriculum, is to build it such that it prepares students for the engineering economy of today, while enabling them to maintain versatility through life-long learning and continuing education. Toward this end, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded a number of Coalitions to study "best practices" in Engineering Education. Overwhelmingly, these Coalitions have favored active-learning activities and integration of complementary subjects. With funding from the NSF, we have expanded the recommendations of the Coalitions and developed an integrated Chemical Engineering curriculum that spans the Sophomore to Senior years. To implement the integrated curriculum, we are using block scheduling, a technique with a strong literature base in K-12 education. In a nutshell, through block scheduling multi-semester courses are delivered in a single-semester course. The result has been the Six Pillars of Chemical Engineering. These courses have considerably longer contact hours than a traditional University course so that: (1) students may gain systems insight through integration of their core knowledge across traditional course and discipline boundaries; (2) the instructors have the time to include truly multi-scale (from molecular to continuum to macroscopic) descriptions of Chemical Engineering content; and (3) the instructors have the flexibility to accommodate diverse learning styles and incorporate active learning more effectively. In this paper, we outline the design of our Six Pillars and highlight preliminary results from the pilot of one Pillar: Transport Phenomena. By using a suite of assessment techniques including concept maps, concept inventories, and surveys, we hope to produce a truly validated success story that can serve as a model that is applicable for all engineering disciplines.

AB  - This chapter demonstrates how the relevant investigation of the history and philosophy of science can contribute to the thorough preparation that is required for constructivistic teaching of the particle theory at the seventh-grade level. For some educators, the common usage of "content analysis"may merely represent an initial process that results in a list of terms, concepts, principles, or theories. It is the format in which syllabi are usually submitted. For others, it may refer to the concept-mapping process of an area of knowledge. Concept mapping is indeed a significant step forward when compared to a linear-style list, as it visually emphasizes which ideas are more central or inclusive than others. Content analysis maps the subject from a disciplinary perspective. Cognitive analysis of content, on the other hand, examines the product of the former analysis from the student's cognitive perspective. It identifies genuine cognitive demands that are presented to the learner by the various components of a concept list or map. It also attempts to identify the potential sources for the cognitive and/or emotional difficulties presented by the various content elements, especially by the most central ideas and concepts. Many children and adolescents may believe that nonliving objects behave purposefully. For example, air wants to escape from a hot container or opposing electrical charges want to stay together. When preparing for constructivist teaching that is aimed at achieving conceptual change in students, it is important to identify and clarify the unique problems of the specific teaching subject. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This article reports the results of an investigation of the convergent criterionrelated validity of two computer-based tools for scoring concept maps and essays as part of the ongoing formative evaluation of these tools. In pairs, participants researched a science topic online and created a concept map of the topic. Later, participants individually wrote a short essay from their concept map. The concept maps and essays were scored by the computerbased tools and by human raters using rubrics. Computer-based concept map scores were a very good measure of the qualitative aspects of the concept maps (r = 0.84) and were an adequate measure of the quantitative aspects (r = 0.65). Also, the computer-based essay scores were an adequate measure of essay content (r = 0.71). If computer-based approaches for scoring concept maps and essays can provide a valid, low-cost, easy to use, and easy to interpret measure of students' content knowledge, then these approaches will likely gain rapid acceptance by teachers at all levels. © 2005, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.

AB  - Previous research on affective extremity and social identity complexity suggested that women's mathematics stereotype threat might be alleviated by reminding individual women of their multiple roles and identities, most of which would presumably be unrelated and thus impervious to negative stereotypes regarding math performance. To test this hypothesis, we primed the relevant stereotype and then asked men and women college students to draw self-concept maps with many or few nodes. When they drew no maps or maps with few nodes, highly math-identified women scored significantly worse than highly math-identified men on a subsequent Graduate Record Examination-like math test, but when they drew maps with many nodes, they scored as well as those men. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

AB  - In this paper, we present two studies designed to help students navigate effectively and learn from a hypertext system, CoMPASS. Our first study (N = 74) involved an analysis of students' navigation patterns to group them into clusters, using a k-means clustering technique. Based on this analysis, navigation patterns were grouped into four clusters, enabling us to understand the kinds of support that students needed. This formed the basis of our next study, in which we designed and implemented metanavigation support to help students navigate and learn science content. Support in the form of prompts was provided to one group (N = 58) while a second group (N = 58) with no support served as the comparison group. Our results suggest that students in the support group performed better on a concept-mapping task. Based on the results we provide suggestions for providing metacognitive support in hypertext systems. © Springer 2005.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of conceptual change texts accompanied with concept mapping instruction, compared to traditional instruction (TI), on 8th grade students' understanding of solution concepts and their attitudes toward science as a school subject. Solution Concept Test was developed as a result of examination of related literature and interviews with teachers regarding their observations of students' difficulties. The test was administered to a total of 64 eighth grade students from two classes of a general science course, taught by the same teacher. The experimental group received the conceptual change texts accompanied with concept mapping in a lecture by the teacher. This instruction explicitly dealt with students' misconceptions. It was designed to suggest conditions in which misconceptions could be replaced by scientific conceptions and new conceptions could be integrated with existing conceptions. The control group received TI in which the teacher provided instruction through lecture and discussion methods. The results showed that conceptual change text accompanied with concept mapping instruction caused a significantly better acquisition of scientific conceptions related to solution concept and produced significantly higher positive attitudes toward science as a school subject than the TI. In addition, logical thinking ability and prior learning were strong predictors for the concept learning related to solution. © Springer 2005.

AB  - The solution of complex, unstructured problems is faced with policy controversy and dispute, unused and misused knowledge, project delay and failure, and decline of public trust in governmental decisions. Mental model mapping (also called concept mapping) is a technique to analyse these difficulties on a fundamental cognitive level, which can reveal experiences, perceptions, assumptions, knowledge and subjective beliefs of stakeholders, experts and other actors, and can stimulate communication and learning. This article presents the theoretical framework from which the use of mental model mapping techniques to analyse this type of problems emerges as a promising technique. The fra mework consists of the problem solving or policy design cycle, the knowledge production or modelling cycle, and the (computer) model as interface between the cycles. Literature attributes difficulties in the decision-making process to communication gaps between decision makers, stakeholders and scientists, and to the construction of knowledge within different paradigm groups that leads to different interpretation of the problem situation. Analysis of the decision-making process literature indicates that choices, which are made in all steps of the problem solving cycle, are based on an individual decision maker's frame of perception. This frame, in turn, depends on the mental model residing in the mind of the individual. Thus we identify three levels of awareness on which the decision process can be analysed. This research focuses on the third level. Mental models can be elicited using mapping techniques. In this way, analysing an individual's mental model can shed light on decision-making problems. The steps of the knowledge production cycle are, in the same manner, ultimately driven by the mental models of the scientist in a specific discipline. Remnants of this mental model can be found in the resulting computer model. The characteristics of unstructu red problems (complexity, uncertainty and disagreement) can be positioned in the framework, as can the communities of knowledge construction and valuation involved in the solution of these problems (core science, applied science, and professional consultancy, and "post-normal" science). Mental model maps, this research hypothesises, are suitable to analyse the above aspects of the problem. This hypothesis is tested for the case of the Zwolle storm surch barrier. Analysis can aid integration between disciplines, participation of public stakeholders, and can stimulate learning processes. Mental model mapping is recommended to visualise the use of knowledge, to analyse difficulties in problem solving process, and to aid information transfer and communication. Mental model mapping help scientists to shape their new, post-normal responsibilities in a manner that complies with integrity when dealing with unstructured problems in complex, multifunctional systems. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dull classroom environments, poor students' attitudes and inhibited conceptual development led to the creation of an innovative mathematics program, the Class Banking System (CBS), which enables teachers to use constructivist ideas and approaches. To assess the effectiveness of the CBS, the Individualised Classroom Environment Questionnaire (ICEQ), Constructivist Learning Environment Survey (CLES), Test of Mathematics-Related Attitudes (TOMRA), and concept map tests were administered to two groups of fifth-grade students as pretests and posttests over an academic year. To enrich the data collected from those questionnaires, three case studies (one for the experimental group and two for the control group) were undertaken based on observations and interviews of selected students. Relative to non-CBS students, CBS students experienced more favorable changes in terms of mathematics concept development, attitudes to mathematics, and perceived classroom environments on several dimensions of the CLES (e.g., Personal Relevance, Shared Control) and the ICEQ (e.g., Participation and Differentiation). Qualitative information based on classroom observations and student interviews reinforced and enriched the patterns of results obtained from the concept test and questionnaires. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2005.

AB  - Both nursing and library science literature discuss the information needs and information-seeking behavior of nurses. Some research has focused on information needs of nursing students, but little research is available regarding information-seeking behavior of nursing students, specifically baccalaureate nursing students. Only a few key references were identified addressing nursing students' information seeking with regard to nurse care planning. At the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, George F. Smith Library, a wide range of nursing students from those in traditional BSN programs, to students in accelerated BSN programs, to masters' nursing students of all types visit the reference desk asking direct and indirect questions involving the nursing care plan. This article highlights repeated categories of information sought by nursing students at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, George F. Smith Library via both formal and informal reference interviews. Information sought most frequently was categorized and formed the basis for a new library workshop entitled "Information Resources for the Nursing Care Plan." © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

AB  - This paper describes the methods and outcomes of a 12-year longitudinal study into the effects of an early intervention program, while reflecting back on changes that have occurred in approaches to research, learning and instruction since the preliminary inception stages of the study in the mid 1960s. We began the study to challenge the prevailing consensus at the time that primary school children were either preoperational or concrete operational in their cognitive development and they could not learn abstract concepts. Our early research, based on Ausubelian theory, suggested otherwise. The paper describes the development and implementation of a Grade 1-2 audio tutorial science instructional sequence, and the subsequent tracing over 12 years, of the children's conceptual understandings in science compared to a matched control group. During the study the concept map was developed as a new tool to trace children's conceptual development. We found that students in the instruction group far outperformed their non-instructed counterparts, and this difference increased as they progressed through middle and high school. The data clearly support the earlier introduction of science instruction on basic science concepts, such as the particulate nature of matter, energy and energy transformations. The data suggest that national curriculum standards for science grossly underestimate the learning capabilities of primary-grade children. The study has helped to lay a foundation for guided instruction using computers and concept mapping that may help both teachers and students become more proficient in understanding science. © Springer 2005.

AB  - Concept browsing interfaces can help educators and learners to locate and use learning resources that are aligned with recognized learning goals. The Strand Map Service enables users to navigate interactive visualizations of related learning goals and to request digital library resources aligned with learning goals. These interfaces are created using a programmatic Web service interface that dynamically generates interactive visual components. Preliminary findings suggest that these library interfaces appear to help users stay focused on the scientific content of their information discovery task, as opposed to focusing on the mechanics of searching. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

AB  - We examine the equivalence of two construct-a-concept-map techniques: construct-a-map with created linking phrases (C), and construct-a-map with selected linking phrases (S). The former places few constraints on the respondent and has been considered the gold standard; the latter is cost and time efficient. Both their products and processes are compared quantitatively and qualitatively as to total accuracy score, individual proposition scores, proposition choice, map structure complexity, proposition generation rate, and proposition generation procedures. We conclude that the two mapping techniques are not equivalent: The C technique is better than the S technique in capturing students' partial knowledge, even though the S can be scored more efficiently than C. Based on their characteristics, if used as an assessment tool, the C technique is more suitable for formative assessment while the S technique is a better fit for large-scale assessments. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This paper discusses the extensions that we have made to Betty's Brain teachable agent system to help students learn about dynamic processes in a river ecosystem. Students first learn about dynamic behavior in a simulation environment, and then teach Betty by introducing cycles into the concept map representation. Betty's qualitative reasoning mechanisms have been extended so that she can reason about cycles and determine how entities change over time. Preliminary experiments were conducted to study and analyze the usefulness of the simulation. Analysis of the students' protocols was very revealing, and the lessons learnt have led to redesigned simulation interfaces. A new study with the system will be conducted in a fifth grade science classroom in May, 2005. © 2005 The authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent government publications such as Benchmarks for Scientific Literacy and Science for All Americans have given teachers a mandate for improving science education in America. What we know about how learners construct meaning--particularly in the natural sciences--has undergone a virtual revolution in the past 25 years. Teachers, as well as researchers, are now grappling with how to better teach science, as well as how to assess whether students are learning. Assessing Science Understanding is a companion volume to Teaching Science for Understanding and explores how to assess whether learning has taken place. The book discusses a range of promising new and practical tools for assessment, including concept maps, vee diagrams, clinical interviews, problem sets, performance-based assessments, computer-based methods, visual and observational testing, portfolios, explanatory models, and national examinations. "This is a timely and useful book for science educators or anyone training to use construct-based assessment in an educational setting. Each chapter has references, advanced organizers, and appropriate figures and adequately discusses the cognitive model used with the assessment device and the logic of its use. This high-quality contribution would be a good addition for libraries of schools offering undergraduate and graduate teacher education degrees, and would be particularly useful for science education programs. The companion volume, Teaching Science for Understanding (1998) by the same editors, should also be considered." -CHOICE "It is difficult to imagine that a reflective teacher who is interested in improving one's practice would not find something of value in these pages...The success of this project will depend on the extent to which the intended audience is willing to dig into the references, reflect on the lessons within the book, and also reflect on teaching practice as they experiment with ways to improve it. If these books, and others like them, have their intended impact, science education will have a bright future." -THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER "...a source of excellent information on new and potentially very powerful, research-based assessment strategies for probing student understanding of science." -PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE "If one is interested in "constructivist" assessment in science, this book is a good resource..." -CONTEMPORARY PSYCHOLOGY. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study examined concept maps produced by personality psychology students as a function of different types of concept map instruction. The results indicated the number of quantitative items in the students' concept maps significantly increased from the pretest to the posttest, as would be expected over the course of an academic semester. More importantly, the type of instructions the students received at the pretest played a significant role in the number of cross links depicted in the maps at the posttest. I discuss the results in terms of the utility of instruction type when using concept maps in social science courses.

AB  - The complex nature of climate change science poses special challenges for educators. Learners come to the classroom with prior knowledge on the topic, which serves as a foundation for further knowledge building, but can also pose barriers to conceptual change. Learners have existing mental models that may limit their perception and processing of conflicting information and prevent adoption of scientific conceptions. Instructional strategies that attempt conceptual change by simply provoking cognitive conflict have had limited success due to the importance of epistemological beliefs and motivation to the conceptual change process. The Mock Environment Summit course uses role-playing, argumentation and discussion to heighten epistemological awareness and motivation and thereby facilitate conceptual change. The pre/post-course concept map evaluation of students' knowledge about the science of global climate change reported here shows evidence of significant learning and conceptual change. Our study also provides useful information about gaps in knowledge and the types of misconceptions students are likely to have about this topic. Insight gained from this assessment study can be used to tailor the curriculum and enhance student progress towards more scientific conceptions of the problem.

AB  - Project Gutenburg, the Million Book Project, the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, Amazon's book search service, and the recently announced collaboration of Google and leading libraries, all aim to make available large numbers of book-length objects, in a variety of languages. Traditional approaches to discovering a suitable book for a particular purpose have generally relied on catalog records, sometimes enhanced with abstracts. Full-text searching popular, e.g., with legal and government documents - and passage retrieval techniques, suitable for encyclopedias and reference works, have not been adequately tested with large collections of large objects. We demonstrate an alternative approach, integrating visualization, text mining, and simple machine translation techniques. We show how electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs), in both English and Spanish, can be summarized as concept maps, according to three different design layouts: whole document maps, chapter-level maps, and table of contents-based maps. Our initial experiments are in the computer science and industrial systems engineering fields. Concept maps (see Figure 1) are "graphical representations of knowledge that are comprised of concepts and the relationships between them" [4]. Concept maps allow students to acquire knowledge more quickly than usual [2], However, concept maps have yet to be extensively researched as aids to knowledge discovery. Our demonstration will show how this can work, including for multi-lingual collections. We argue that 1) users can more quickly grasp the key ideas of a work from a concept map than from an abstract alone; 2) it is easier to automatically generate concept maps than good abstracts; and 3) it is easier to automatically translate concept maps than abstracts. We have tested several methods of finding relations in the texts, such as association rules [1], t-scores, Pearson's χ2. Dice's coefficient, and mutual information. Using part-of-speech information from MontyTagger [3], we can find noun phrases which appear as nodes in the maps. Other parts-of-speech, usually verbs or prepositions, are used as the links between the nodes. Our demonstration highlights these techniques.

AB  - Most of the intelligent tutoring system (ITS) is used to deliver knowledge and train skills based on the expert model. According to the theories of leaning, learning by teaching method is more efficient for enhancing motivation to learn and cognitive ability than learning by listening or learning by reading. For the purpose of developing an adaptive intelligent agent to enhance the motivation to learn, the new type of teachable agent were designed and implemented, the KORI (KORea university Intelligent agent), in which the user plays a role of a tutor by teaching the agent using a concept map, posing questions, and providing feedbacks. KORI consists of four independent modules: teach module, Q&A module, test module, and resource module. In teach module, the KORI's knowledge is structured and organized through the concept map and the KORI makes new knowledge from the inference engine. In Q&A module, the KORI can provide answers to the users' questions through an interactive window. It is expected that providing the user with the active role of teaching the agent enhance the motivation to learn and the positive attitude toward the subject matter as well as cognition. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

AB  - Using concept maps and clinical interviews, we assessed the extent to which undergraduate students restructure their conceptual knowledge at progressively more sophisticated levels over the course of a two-semester lecture-based physical geology sequence. Students completed concept mapping exercises and clinical interviews at regular intervals throughout the two semesters and data indicated that the course did not address integration of concepts into student knowledge domains. Concept maps and clinical interviews both illustrated acquisition of geologic concepts longitudinally with a disproportionately small increase in integration of those concepts into frameworks of understanding. However, concept maps and clinical interviews appear to be viable and complementary approaches in determining the degree to which student accomplishment objectives are being met.

AB  - This article provides a model for the professional development of elementary science teachers. The model focused on integrating different domains of knowledge into science teaching, including the knowledge of the science curriculum, especially scientific inquiry, teacher's knowledge, and students' knowledge. The two case studies in this article revealed that the teachers construct their knowledge in a social context. The constant reflections on the experiences helped them to generate alternative teaching approaches. The findings suggest that the model of the project had two functions. First, it provides a useful strategy to help science teachers to bridge the gap between theories of teaching and their own teaching practices. Second, it provides a social learning environment for learning how to teach science. © National Science Council.

AB  - For achieving the adaptive learning, a predefined concept map of a course is often used to provide adaptive learning guidance for learners. However, it is difficult and time consuming to create the concept map of a course. Thus, how to automatically create a concept map of a course becomes an interesting issue. In this paper, we propose a Two-Phase Concept Map Construction (TP-CMC) approach to automatically construct the concept map by learners' historical testing records. Phase 1 is used to preprocess the testing records. We apply Fuzzy Set Theory to transform the numeric testing records of learners into symbolic, apply Education Theory (Item Analysis for Norm-Referencing) to further refine it, and apply Data Mining approach to find its grade fuzzy association rules. Then, in Phase 2, based upon our observation in real learning situation, we use multiple rule types to further analyze the mined rules and then propose a heuristic algorithm to automatically construct the concept map. Finally, the Redundancy and Circularity of the concept map constructed are also evaluated.

AB  - Components of problem-based education, such as small group teaching, are being implemented in diverse health curricula. Implementation, however, is often motivated by the intuitive appeal of many problem-based learning components, when what is needed is the detailed examination of how these components support students' integration of knowledge as well as continuity of their learning experiences. This study presents an investigation of the relationship between lecture and small group teaching (SGT) in a medical curriculum. Four problem-oriented SGT sessions representing diverse topics in the first-year curriculum and their corresponding lectures were videotaped and analyzed using techniques of concept mapping, where the broad concepts from the lectures were identified and matched to the case-specific concepts in the small group sessions. The results show that lectures function as an anchor for the students' discussion of issues relevant to clinical problem-solving and interventions in small group sessions. These discussions extended to contextual aspects of clinical practice that were not dealt with in the lectures, such as ethical/cultural issues around the treatment of patients. Furthermore, small group environments were found to promote discussions that allowed the integration of information from different sources and encompassed concepts across a number of disciplines. These results suggest that carefully designed small group sessions serve the purposes of 1) illustrating broader concepts in lectures to case-specific, clinically relevant problem-solving and 2) promoting knowledge integration from diverse sources of information. The implications of these results for learning and reasoning in health science curricula are discussed.

AB  - This three-part article begins with a brief presentation of a framework that describes different approaches to conduct and report research on expert knowledge. The framework contrasts direct vs. indirect approaches and provides examples of each. Second, the article gives a detailed description of the methods and results of three concept mapping studies in pulmonary physiology that employ Pathfinder scaling, an indirect approach. The studies derive concepts maps for a variety of faculty experts individually and in groups. Two of the studies focus on changes in students' concept maps of the pulmonary physiology concepts as a result of instruction. Changes are gauged in terms of the degree to which students' concept maps approximate instructors' concept maps due to educational interventions. An index of student-instructor concept map similarity is also correlated with student performance on final examinations. The article concludes by articulating several "next steps" in the Feinberg Northwestern and Wisconsin program of health sciences education research on concept mapping using Pathfinder scaling.

AB  - The search for authentic science research tools to evaluate student understanding in a hybrid learning environment with a large multimedia component has resulted in the use of concept maps as a representation of student's knowledge organization. One hundred and seventy third-semester introductory university-level engineering students represented their understanding related to the atom in a concept map. A qualitative analysis of the data presented a more informative and complete picture of students' understanding as compared with most prominent scoring techniques in the literature. The detailed analysis method is illustrated by means of some students' concept maps and the overall results of the entire student population are discussed. The most striking difference between common and more insightful maps is the inclusion of additional clusters describing models of the atom, beyond the clusters that just describe the elements of atoms (e.g. protons, electrons, etc.) and their characteristics. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.

AB  - This study is intended to develop an assessment instrument to investigate students' understandings about internal transport in plants and human circulatory system. A refined process of a two-tier diagnostic test was used to develop the instrument. Finally, three versions of the Internal Transport in Plants and the Human Circulatory System test were developed for different educational levels: elementary, secondary and high school level. The test-retest reliability, the degree of difficulty, and the range of discrimination were found to be reasonable for all three versions. The statistical variances across educational levels of the verification samples and the test applications are discussed. The students' major alternative conceptions on internal transport of plants and human were classified into three attributes of explanations: interconnectedness, language and anthropomorphism. Based on the nature of students' explanations, card-sorting with justification, learning cycle and concept mapping were recommended for in-depth learning of the concept. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2004.

AB  - Concept maps that integrate and relate concepts in a nonlinear fashion are widely accepted as an educational tool that can underpin meaningful learning in medical education. However, student take-up may be affected by a number of cognitive and non-cognitive influences. In the present study, student attitudes to pre-prepared concept maps introduced in Stage 2 conjoint MPharm and BSc Pharmacology lectures were examined in relation to preferred learning styles according to the Felder-Silverman model. There was no statistically significant influence of dichotomous learning style dimension (sensing/intuitive; visual/verbal; active/reflector; sequential/global) on the self-reported utility of such concept maps to learning. However, when strength of preference was analysed within each dimension, moderate/strong verbal learners were found to be significantly less likely to self-report concept maps as useful relative to mild verbal learners. With this important exception, these data now suggest that student attitudes to concept maps are broadly not influenced by preferred learning styles and furthermore highlight the potential of concept maps to address a variety of different learning styles and thereby facilitate 'teaching to all types'. Concept maps could therefore potentially assist motivation, engagement and deep learning in medical and biomedical science education when used as a supplement to more traditional teaching/learning activities. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

AB  - In this article, we adopted the relational conceptual change as our theoretical framework to accommodate current views of conceptual change such as ontological beliefs, epistemological commitment, and social/affective contexts commonly mentioned in the literature. We used a specific concept mapping formal and process-digraphs and digraphing-as an operational framework for assessing and promoting relational conceptual change. We wanted to find out how concept mapping can be used to account for relational conceptual change. We collected data from a Grade 12 chemistry class using collaborative computerized concept mapping on an ongoing basis during a unit of instruction. Analysis of progressive concept maps and interview transcripts of representative students and the teacher showed that ongoing and collaborative computerized concept mapping is able to account for student conceptual change in ontological, epistemological, and social/affective domains. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Science content area texts are difficult for most middle school students, particularly whose reading skills are below grade level. This article describes an innovative approach to integrating the teaching of middle school science content and reading skills to increase levels of student success with content area textbooks. For reading instruction, this approach features carefully selected vocabulary, word reading instruction, oral (including partner reading) and silent reading with reading fluency practice as needed, and explicit instruction on comprehension strategies, such as retelling, concept mapping, and summarization. The teaching of the science content incorporates instructional design principles that have been documented to improve comprehension of science content, process skills, and higher order thinking. Six aspects of instructional design that are discussed are the identification and teaching of big ideas, the systematic instruction of vocabulary (including science affixes), a review and integration of core concepts, visual displays of how core concepts are integrated, mnemonics for core concepts, and structured hands-on activities. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper argues for the integration of metacognitive thinking into the content of school science. It describes the 'metacognitive instances' approach of implanting metacognitive activities, such as classroom discussions, annotated drawing, keeping diary-like notes and concept-mapping, at selected points of the teaching procedure, in an attempt to extend the durability of children's science understanding, which is often short-lived. The approach was tested with 60 Year 5 pupils in Cyprus studying 'Current Electricity', following a quasi-experimental design with one experimental and one comparative group. Following the teaching of the unit, participants were tested on their understanding of electricity three times in one school year. The research showed that the practice of metacognition is feasible with primary school pupils and that children who experienced situated metacognition retained taught concepts for a longer period of time. Although no significant difference was recorded initially in the amount of subject matter learned by the two groups, children who engaged in metacognitive activities appeared to have achieved more permanent re-structuring of their understandings.

AB  - In the past three decades, there have been enormous advances in our understanding of the nature of knowledge and the processes by which humans construct new knowledge. There is now general agreement that knowledge is a human creation, where new ideas are constructed by creative people on the basis of their existing concepts and theories and of a search for new patterns or regularities in events or objects they observe. The constructed nature of knowledge means also that knowledge in every domain continues to evolve over time. We see concepts as the fundamental building blocks of knowledge, and we define concepts as perceived regularities or patterns in events or objects, or records of events or objects, designated by a label, usually a word. There have been even greater advances in our understanding of human learning in the past three decades. These advances have focused on the importance of learners’ prior knowledge for the acquisition of new knowledge and on the need to sequence instruction to build upon the learners’ existing concepts and propositions. It is also recognized that each learner must construct her/his own concepts and propositions and that this process can be most productive when the learner consciously seeks to integrate new concepts and propositions into her/his cognitive structure, a process that requires meaningful learning, in contrast to the rote learning or memorization so common in school learning. Since 1963, our work has been based on the cognitive psychology of David Ausubel, including the design of the audio-tutorial lessons used in a 12-year longitudinal study of children’s science concept learning and the development of a tool we call a concept map to represent knowledge organized into cognitive structures. It has been possible to show explicitly the progressive growth in children’s understanding of science concepts and propositions over time, and in some cases, the lack of such growth. Concept maps have subsequently been used to help students learn how to learn, to capture and archive expert knowledge, and to facilitate creative production. We have also shown that the learning capabilities of young children have been grossly underestimated, especially for “abstract” concepts about the nature of matter and energy (see, e.g., the recommendations for national science standards; National Research Council, 1996). In the past decade, there has been the incredible development of the Internet to share information on virtually any topic. Moreover, enormously increased computer power, transmission band width, and other technological advances now make it possible to provide to any learner almost anywhere in the world all of the information needed to gain mastery of any subject. We are currently seeking ways to exploit these potentials, especially with the use of new concept-mapping software, to help teachers and students ‘scaffold’ their learning, using expert concept maps and the collaborative possibilities of the new technologies. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study examined the effects of concept mapping on the science achievement of middle grade science students. The subjects were 182 eighth-grade students, distributed into eight intact earth science classes by ability levels. The ability level variable also was examined as a possible effect on student achievement. Two teachers were involved in teaching a unit on weather for nine weeks. An objective weather test and six performance assessment items were used to measure achievement. For this group of students, analyses indicated no significant overall effects of treatment on science achievement. A statistically significant effect was found between concept mapping and student achievement among the average students, as measured by combined performance assessment items. The results suggest that the effect of concept mapping on science achievement is not clear, but that lower ability students appear to have better success with concept mapping than higher ability students. © 2004 by the Association for Childhood Education International.

AB  - Concept maps (CM) are informal, semantic, node-link conceptual graphs used to represent knowledge in a variety of applications. Algorithms that compare concept maps would be useful in supporting educational processes and in leveraging indexed digital collections of concept maps. Map comparison begins with element matching and faces computational challenges arising from vocabulary overlap, informality, and organizational variation. Our implementation of an adapted similarity flooding algorithm improves matching of CM knowledge elements over a simple string matching approach.

AB  - This paper describes MECUREO, a system that automatically constructs an ontology from a dictionary. We describe its use in the context of a dictionary of computer science. MECUREO parses this to construct a graph representing a lightweight ontology of computer science. The paper describes MECUREO's approach to parsing the dictionary and the construction of the ontology graph. We also describe MECUREO's point query facility. This generates a small ontology for use in a particular teaching context, such as single lesson. We report two evaluations of the effectiveness of the ontology construction, one based on a qualitative concept mapping experiment, and the other, on a quantitative comparison of the computer science ontology with another similar ontology.

After explaining how concepts can be represented, it introduces a learner evaluation technique based on a concept maps analysis. The way an epistemic learner model can be made from this evaluation is then proposed. Finally, adaptation techniques based on this model are presented. With this method, different adaptation schemes can be applied to the document depending on the learner's errors. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - A reconnaissance study of the geology professional development program known as RockCamp was initiated to examine the sustained, or recurrent, participation of K-12 science teachers. Open-ended interviews, concept mapping, and creative writing assignments were used to explore the perceptions of six teachers possessing an exceptional record of participation. Efficacy, fun, right time of life, and support emerged as unanimous reasons for recurrent participation. Content, friendship, and methodology were very important. College credit was not critical. These teachers' perceptions suggest their sustained involvement in the RockCamp Program is stimulated by situated learning experiences stressing a compare, contrast, connect, and construct pedagogy within a supportive learning community.

AB  - Mineralogy is usually the first geology course taken by students above the 100 level, and as such it is a vital building block for geology curricula. In recent years the number of mineralogists has declined, the relevance of the field has been questioned, and as a result the course has often been taught by less than enthusiastic non-specialists in the field. We believe that the key to restructuring mineralogy involves setting reasonable, prioritized course goals and employing (at least) four modern pedagogical learning methods: spiral learning, inquiry-based learning, concept maps, and use of interactive models and visualization. We present here a revised mineralogy curriculum that benefits from reflections on appropriate content and on these new learning methods teaching styles.

AB  - The concept mapping method is presented in the current study as a new tool to assess the learning process taking part in the hallmark of a nutritional education program addressed to obese diabetic patients. Population: eight patients were interviewed prior to and after completion of 1-week in-hospital stay during which concept maps were designed. Concept maps quantitative and qualitative analysis disclose both (i) the importance of previous knowledge among patients prior to nutritional education and (ii) the maintenance of misconceptions after it. Nutritional education allows patients to acquire and structure their knowledge while providing them with a certain amount of medical vocabulary. An underlying correlation between concept maps design and the results of psychological tests identifying eating behaviour troubles (EBT), depression or anxiety has not been clearly identified. However, the nutritional education is more beneficial to those patients with a higher degree of self-assertiveness and with a lesser degree of anxiety, depression and eating disorder. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Our overall objective is to help students develop the foundational capabilities needed to become successful software developers, that will help them learn how to effectively analyze, design, and implement software systems. The main focus of this paper is the development and use of a concept-based learning tool that helps students acquire effective analysis and design skills for the development of object-oriented programs. Concept maps are tools for organizing and representing knowledge; they enable learners to construct, navigate, share, and criticize knowledge models represented as augmented graphical concept maps. Using the concept map-based tool, students can use concept maps of object-oriented programming to help them solve problems.

AB  - The research focus on children's science has recently shifted from separate concepts to more comprehensive and complex topics. This study addressed pupils' understanding of the complex topic of energy flow and matter cycling. A scoring system with three categories and six concepts was developed and used by four biology teachers to analyze 106 pupils' concept maps. The results indicate that most of the pupils failed to recognize the interrelationships among the various concepts concerned with units of energy flow and matter cycling. It was the relationship between the living world and the non-living world that presented the greatest difficult to understanding. This paper concludes with suggestions for curriculum development and biology teaching.

AB  - Research has established that students enter their science classes with ideas about the natural world that do not align with accepted scientific beliefs. The diagnosis of these student preconceptions may be seen as an initial, crucial step in the process of teacher-facilitated conceptual change. So as to capture what science teachers do in their everyday classroom routines to diagnose these student preconceptions, in-depth observations and interviews were conducted with four exemplary secondary science teachers. The teachers' strategies for diagnosing students' preconceptions, their use of information found through diagnosis, and the teachers' understanding of students' preinstructional ideas were all analyzed. The four teachers in this study did not use any formal assessment tools such as pretests, concept maps, interviews, or journal writing to diagnose students' ideas, although they all stated that finding out what students know prior to instruction is important. The teachers all declared that they used questioning to gather information on student ideas but were seen in their classes to rely heavily on low-level, recall questions. One of the teachers, the most experienced, did conduct class discussions where the students were encouraged to express their ideas and preconceptions. The four teachers' understanding of what student preconceptions consist of and the justification for attempting to diagnose these ideas was seen to be weak. The implications of these findings and recommendations for teacher training are made in the article. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The AstraZeneca-Exeter Science through Telematics (AZEST) project provided evidence that the Internet has much potential as a communication channel for the provision and discussion of INSET materials for primary science in the UK. Participating teachers were able to access and use the project website effectively, were more likely to provide feedback when they had personal access to the Internet either at home or at school, and provided valuable feedback concerning the AZEST tasks, but they tended not to respond directly to messages from other participants. Discussion, via e-mail or a web-based discussion forum, was enhanced if participants knew each other personally. There was evidence that the AZEST science INSET materials enhanced teachers' understanding of science concepts and raised their confidence, increased teachers' effectiveness in the role of Science Subject Leader, and improved teachers' pedagogic practice through encouraging innovative investigative approaches to the teaching and learning of science. Participating teachers indicated that a website dedicated to primary science at the local level was valued. Concept mapping was found to be a valuable tool for stimulating discussion and for assessing pupils' and teachers' understanding and was mostly enjoyed by pupils and staff.

AB  - The National Science Digital Library (NSDL), launched in December 2002, is emerging as a center of innovation in digital libraries as applied to education. As a part of this extensive project, the GetSmart system was created to apply knowledge management techniques in a learning environment. The design of the system is based on an analysis of learning theory and the information search process. Its key notion is the integration of search tools and curriculum support with concept mapping. More than 100 students at the University of Arizona and Virginia Tech used the system in the fall of 2002. A database of more than one thousand student-prepared concept maps has been collected with more than forty thousand relationships expressed in semantic, graphical, node-link representations. Preliminary analysis of the collected data is revealing interesting knowledge representation patterns. © 2003 IEEE.

AB  - Over the last several decades, many poultry science programs have merged with other departments, but the poultry industry has undergone tremendous expansion worldwide, leading to a growing instructional void with regard to poultry production information. The objective of this project was to address the demand for information by developing two Web-based poultry production courses that cover management of broilers, turkeys, breeders, and layers. The Internet was chosen as the platform because it is asynchronous and may be accessed from any connected site around the world. To be effective, web-based courseware must be theoretically grounded and interactive, but university-level web-based distance education courses often fail to meet these standards. During courseware development, the impact of instructional techniques and technologies on interactivity and learning outcomes was explored. A content expert, an instructional designer, and a graphic artist carefully reviewed a variety of instructional techniques to increase interactivity. Concept mapping was chosen because it has been shown to be a superior learning tool for enhancing the exchange of ideas and knowledge between instructors, students, and content. A unique instructional interface was established that includes threaded e-mail discussion, thought questions, animation, hypertext, rollover interactions, video clips, and concept mapping exercises. Results indicate that the integration of concept mapping into web-based learning environments successfully increased interactivity and learning outcomes.

AB  - Changing a surgical wound dressing is a traditional nursing task that incorporates many areas of nursing knowledge. This article describes the construction of a concept map to sort the subjective, objective and constructed knowledge required to perform this task with optimal wound healing the goal. Critical thinking is used to select and exclude information. The use of concept maps as a tool to synthesise knowledge is discussed as is how the chosen concept incorporates the art and science of nursing care. The concept map displays the wholistic assessment of the client and use of nursing knowledge to determine and promote wound healing.

AB  - We have developed a software engineering process for the design of scaffolded work environments, or SWEets. This process is inspired by the principles of learner-centered design (LCD), which is an approach that recognises learners as a unique group of novice users who must be supported in learning the content and work practices of an unfamiliar domain. SWEets provide this support through the use of scaffolds, which are tools and techniques used to support learners in completing an activity that would otherwise be too difficult or complex. We describe our software engineering methodology for designing SWEets for any educational domain, and look specifically at two case studies of SWEets developed for desktop and handheld platforms. We describe the design of Symphony, a desktop SWEet that provides process scaffolding to support students engaged in complex scientific investigations, and discuss the results of a classroom study of the software. We also look at the development of Pocket PiCoMap, a tool to support students who are using handheld computers to create concept maps, and discuss an ongoing study of the use of mobile handheld devices with wireless internet access in a middle-school science classroom.

AB  - Integration of field experiences and hands-on laboratory exercises have been demonstrated to be effective teaching methods in the sciences. The geosciences, in particular, depend heavily on field investigations. In this study, a multi-week laboratory sequence was developed and assessed as to its effectiveness in enhancing student learning in a hydrogeology course. The laboratory sequence strives to integrate field and laboratory exercises into a cohesive unit that illustrates the physical and hydraulic properties of aquifers, and to develop links between hydrogeology and related undergraduate courses in the Earth and environmental sciences. Assessment of student learning showed a positive effect of the lab as demonstrated by concept mapping comparisons and performance on test questions.

AB  - Educational research findings suggest that instructors can foster the growth of thinking skills and promote science literacy by incorporating active learning strategies into the classroom. Active learning occurs when instructors build learner participation into classes. Learning in large, general education Earth Science classes was evaluated using formative assessment exercises conducted by students in groups. Bloom's taxonomy of cognitive development was used as a guide to identify critical thinking skills (comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation) that could be linked to specific assessment methods such as conceptests, Venn diagrams, image analysis, concept maps, open-ended questions, and evaluation rubrics. Two instructors conducted a series of analyses on sample classes taught with traditional lecture and inquiry-based learning methods. Qualitative and quantitative analyses show that such methods are preferred by students, improve student retention, produce no decrease in content knowledge, promote deeper understanding of course material, and increase logical thinking skills.

AB  - Research into learning in informal settings such as museums has been in a formative state during the past decade, and much of that research has been descriptive and lacking a theory base. In this article, it is proposed that the human constructivist view of learning can guide research and assist the interpretation of research data because it recognizes an individual's prior knowledge and active involvement in knowledge construction during a museum visit. This proposal is supported by reference to the findings of a previously reported interpretive case study, which included concept mapping and semistructured interviews, of the knowledge transformations of three Year 7 students who had participated in a class visit to a science museum and associated postvisit activities. The findings from that study are shown in this report to be consistent with the human constructivist view of learning in that for all three students, learning was found to be at times incremental and at other times to involve substantial restructuring of knowledge. Thus, we regard that the human constructivist view of learning has much merit and utility for researchers investigating the development of knowledge and understanding emergent from experiences in informal settings. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings for teachers and staff of museums and similar institutions are also discussed.

AB  - This cross-age study explored the structural complexity and propositional validity of knowledge about and attitudes toward sharks, and the relationships among knowledge and attitudes. Responses were elicited from a convenience sample of students (5th, 8th and 11th grade, and college level) and senior citizens (n = 238). All subjects constructed a concept map on sharks and responded to a Likert-type attitude inventory. Based on the work of Novak and Gowin (Leaning How to Learn, Cambridge University Press, 1984), concept maps were scored for frequencies of non-redundant concepts and scientifically valid relationships, levels of hierarchy, incidence of branching and number of crosslinks. The attitude inventory, emerging from Kellert's (The Value of Life: Biological Diversity and Human Society, Island Press, 1996) work, generated subscale scores on four affective dimensions: scientific, naturalistic, moralistic and utilitarian/negative. Significant differences were found among subject groups on all knowledge structure variables and attitudinal dimensions. Gender differences were documented on three of four attitude subscales. A series of simple, mulitiple and canonical correlations revealed moderately strong relationships between knowledge structure variables and attitudinal dimensions. The pattern of these relationships supports conservation education efforts and instructional practices that encourage meaningful learning, knowledge restructuring and conceptual change (Mintzes et al., Assessing Science Understanding: A Human Constructivist View, Academic Press, 2000).

AB  - This study investigates to what extent collaborative knowledge construction can be fostered by providing students with visualization tools as structural support. Students (32) of Educational Psychology took part in the study. The students were subdivided into dyads and asked to solve a case problem of their learning domain under one of two conditions: (1) with content-specific visualization; (2) with content-unspecific visualization. Results show that by being provided with a content-specific visualization tool, both the process and the outcome of the cooperative effort improved. More specifically, dyads under that condition referred to more adequate concepts, risked more conflicts, and were more successful in integrating prior knowledge into the collaborative solution. Moreover, those learning partners had a more similar individual learning outcome. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction. In conjunction with GPs reporting on their own practice experiences, the experiences of non-GP health professionals and consumer representatives working at the primary care-general practice interface provide valuable considerations for exploring concepts for the development of a GP Integration Index relevant to Australian General Practice. Objectives. To identify concepts that GPs, non-GP health service providers and consumer representatives perceive to be important in facilitating a well integrated approach to delivering primary care, and how these are perceived to be occurring in practice. Method. Group discussions about GP integration were elicited using concept mapping with four groups of GPs and seven groups of health professionals and consumer representatives, purposively selected for diversity in demographic location and practice setting from three Australian States. From Victoria, 19 GPs from two different types of practice settings, 12 Consumer Representatives from 10 separate organisations, 17 Hospital Administrators from 16 major public and private hospitals, 18 specialist doctors representing 12 specialist organisations and 13 Community Service Providers. From Queensland, 13 rural GPs and 22 Nurses representing 10 separate nursing groups were selected. From Western Australia, 19 GPs representing a mix of solo practice, group practice and hospital settings, and 40 Allied Health providers representing various private practitioners and hospital and community centre based allied health practitioners. Concept mapping results from the groups were pooled and analysed using a descriptive meta-matrix to identify overarching themes. Results. Eight overarching themes were identified from consolidated concept maps: GP role; quality outcomes; practice management/accessibility; communication and networks; health care system politics; education and knowledge; personal attributes and attitudes; and lifestyle. Within these major themes, clusters of concepts rated as at least 'important for patient care' included various non-clinical aspects of primary care delivery. There was emphasis on a patient - centred and holistic care approach. Strongly advocated by all groups was the need for teamwork between GPs and other health care professionals involved in primary care of the patient. Conclusion. The use of concept mapping was successful in ensuring that the breadth of the topic was explored in its entirety among these groups, contributing to the identification of the dimensions of the concept of GP-integration. Findings from these groups will be pooled and subjected to structural equation modelling processes, to develop a general practice integration index relevant to the Australian setting. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - After an instructor has used a Web-based forum in a course for years, the system database will contain an accumulation of discussion messages, which may be on similar topics, from different classes within a course. Furthermore, the discussion processes of some classes may be very heuristic for other learners in the same course. In general, a Web-based forum serves as additional channels for learners to discuss learning topics in the absence of an instructor. However, an instructor may want to guide learners in reading meaningful discussion messages in previous learners' discussion records when a similar question is asked. Hence, it is necessary to model the relationships between discussion messages from different classes in the same course. Furthermore, an instructor desires no unanswered question, called a dangling question, in a Web-based forum because of the possible negative influences, such as discouraging learners to raise questions. This paper proposes a conceptmapping method, which originates from information retrieval technology, for representing the relationships between learners' questions and previous learners' discussion messages. Consequently, the methodology enables an instructor to locate easily from the system database a set of discussion messages with conceptual similarity as answers to eliminate the dangling question. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The use of student-constructed concept maps in assessment is congruent with the changing emphases set forth by the National Science Education Standards. Authorities have expressed concern about concept map scoring systems and their associated validity and reliability. They favor methods that employ expert/criterion maps as referents and emphasize the use of accurate concept relationships in deriving scores, which have been found to correlate with performance on standardized tests. In this study, student constructed concept maps (n= 17) that emerged from post-instructional interviews about chlorofluorocarbons were scored against a teacher-expert map using a scheme weighted for relationships. Interrater reliability for the scoring scheme was high (r=.959). Students' map scores correlated highly with their scores on the California Achievement Test component total (r=.729) and moderately with their Pathfinder index (r=.474), the latter believed to be an excellent measure of structural knowledge. A revised map score, derived only from relationships containing one or more of the concepts employed in Pathfinder analysis, was a statistically significant (p=.031) predictor of the Pathfinder index. The findings of this study support the recommendations of others to use expert referents and emphasize concept relationships in assessing concept maps. 2002 School Science and Mathematics Association.

AB  - The ImpacT2 evaluation is using image based concept mapping as one method of exploring the impact of networked technologies on students' learning. In a pre-test administered in June 2000, students in three cohorts aged 10-11, 13-14 and 15-16, produced around 2000 'maps'. Entitled 'Computers in My World', these provide a means of students externalising mental representations of networked technologies. Using a phenomenographic approach, the study aims to identify qualitatively different patterns of thinking and trends in the development of pupils' concepts. Five quanititative measures emerged from heuristic analysis of the maps: nodes, links, connectivity, 'Spheres of Thinking' and 'Zones of Use'. Analysis of the pre-test maps was carried out alongside analysis of pre-test questionnaires, using SPSS. The outcomes suggest correlations between pupils' experience and the constent of their maps. Phenomenographic interviewing of selected 11 year old pupils, which entailed handling control over to interviewees through the use of openended questions, enabled further exploration of their experiences and understandings of those experiences. A method for in-depth interviewing of young students is described. Data suggest that pupils have sophisticated 'secondary artifacts' or mental models of the nature of networked technologies and their role in today's world. This has implications for the way that ICT is used in schools and for its potential as a tool for students' learning. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Understanding how people think and how people organise knowledge are always major concerns for educational researchers. Hence, educators have developed various ways of representing learners' 'cognitive structures'. This article provides a review of the use of five methods of representing cognitive structures - free word association, controlled word association, tree construction, concept map and flow map. Through comparing the types of analyses that are generated from these cognitive structure representation methods, this paper discusses the applications, as well as the limitations, among these methods.

AB  - The major purpose of this study was to describe a science teacher's views of STS (Science-Technology-Society) instruction and what she acquired after implementing a two-semester STS-oriented science course in a high school of Taiwan. Upon analysis of the teacher's journals, interview data, concept maps, and relevant student questionnaire responses, this study revealed the following findings. The teacher believed that STS instruction was a potential way of practicing so-called "constructivist" teaching and her pedagogical knowledge about STS showed a considerable growth. As a result of STS instruction, her epistemological views of science seemed to progress toward more constructivist-oriented views of science. The heavy content load of Taiwan's national curriculum, regular cross-class standard tests, the lack of peers' or administrative support, the resource limitations in Chinese language, and the cultural impacts were identified as major factors that inhibited her implementation of STS instruction. © 2001 John wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Student learning in complex fields such as physical science can be difficult to assess. Performance assessment techniques offer an alternative way of approaching this goal. This paper addresses the use of concept mapping as a means of assessing changes in the way students grasp the conceptual structure of specific topics in physical science. A concept map is interpreted as representing important aspects of the student's organisation of concepts and, indirectly, the student's construction of meaning. Therefore, concept mapping has the potential to provide direct measures of students' knowledge structures. Various concept mapping techniques are reviewed based on their validity and reliability when used as a means of assessing student learning. The educational implications of adopting concept mapping performance assessment strategies are also discussed along with directions for future research.

AB  - Concept mapping is described repeatedly in the literature as a tool that can support and enhance students' learning in science classrooms. Despite such endorsements, the use of concept mapping as a basis for classroom activities in UK secondary schools does not seem to be widespread. Some of the flaws in the supporting literature are highlighted. The two main barriers to the extensive adoption of concept mapping as an integral component of typical classroom strategies are seen as the epistemological beliefs of classroom teachers and the underlying philosophy of the curriculum that they are asked to deliver. In conclusion, concept mapping is seen as a tool that may support learning within an appropriate teaching ecology. Such an ecological perspective may require, for some, a re-conceptualization of the teacher's role in which teaching, learning and change are seen as integrated components of effective teaching.

AB  - The study reported in this paper developed and evaluated a web-based concept map testing system for science students. Thirty-eight Taiwanese high school students were involved and it was found that their performance on the system was not significantly related to their achievement as measured by traditional standard tests. Their views about the use of the system, in general, were positive. An analysis of students' future use of the system and their motivation and learning strategies revealed that those with more critical thinking metacognitive activities and an effort regulation management strategy showed more willingness to use the online testing system. Moreover, students with high test anxiety showed a preference to be tested through the system.

AB  - Multiple intelligences (MI) theory (Gardner, 1983), a pluralistic conception of intelligence, has been adopted by educators in a variety of ways to improve teaching and learning. Some adaptations have included exploring learning styles, designing lesson plans, developing integrated curricula, and adopting authentic forms of assessment.In this case study, a high school science teacher, Jade (a pseudonym), explored MI theory and used it as a conceptual framework to make decisions about how to structure her Grade 9 science curriculum. In studying the case, a variety of data sources and methods were used, including audiotaped planning meetings and interviews, classroom observations, teacher‐generated concept maps, and reflective journals.This article describes Jade's initial explorations of the theory, how she incorporated the theory into her daily teaching, and the outcomes of the study for Jade and her students. In addition, tensions and challenges experienced by Jade in applying the theory to practice and the implications for science teaching and learning are discussed. © 2001 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The majority of public school teachers do not feel well prepared to use instructional technology. Professional development on computer-based concept mapping responds to this concern through focusing on a tool/software that has many applications and is not difficult to master. A subset (n = 18) of science teachers in a Health Sciences and Technology Academy (HSTA) completed a workshop on electronic concept mapping and were provided with school site licenses and other follow-up support (summer institute). They utilized the software in academic enrichment for underserved students, regular classroom instruction, and inservice training for colleagues. Triangulation of findings from data sources (electronic conferencing, lesson plans, workshop evaluations) revealed that HSTA teachers embrace electronic concept mapping as a versatile educational tool. Factors contributing to this enthusiasm included the ease with which students use the software, the transparent nature of the learning process for these students, and the positive attitudes of colleagues whom they have inserviced. The findings from this project are congruent with what experts contend to be critical features of effective teacher professional development: facilitating a community of learners and providing sustained support. This project now funds software use in over 45 public schools. © 2001 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - This paper discusses several new assessment strategies that encourage meaningful learning and conceptual understanding in the biological sciences. Our purpose is to introduce a handful of evaluation and measurement techniques that help students assimilate well-integrated, strongly cohesive frameworks of interrelated concepts as a way of facilitating 'real understanding' of natural phenomena. Among these methods are concept maps, V diagrams, SemNet software, image-based test items, clinical interviews, portfolios, written products, performance measures, and conceptual diagnostic tests. Evidence suggests that these methods are most useful at highlighting 'alternative conceptions' and assisting students who wish to 'learn how to learn'.

AB  - Summarized are research findings and policy implications obtained over a 5 year period (51 teachers, 1200 students) from the implementation of an in-depth expanded applications of science (IDEAS) model with average, above average, and at-risk students in grades 2-5. The IDEAS model replaced the time allocated for traditional reading/language arts instruction with a daily 2 hour time-block dedicated solely to in-depth science concept instruction which encompassed reading comprehension and language arts skills (e.g. concept-focused teaching, hands-on activities, utilization of science process skills, reading of science print materials, concept map construction, journal writing). The multi-year results revealed a consistent pattern of the model's effectiveness in improving both the science understanding (effects on the Metropolitan Achievement Test-Science ranged from 0.93 to 1.6 grade equivalents) and reading achievement (effects on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills-Reading and the Stanford Achievement Tests-Reading ranged from 0.3 to 0.5 grade equivalents). Participating students also consistently displayed significantly more positive attitudes and self-confidence toward both science and reading. Interpreting the findings, the IDEAS model was considered to provide clear evidence for the importance of focusing the teaching-learning process on the conceptual structure of the curricular knowledge to be learned in a fashion consistent with research and policy issues raised by the recent TIMSS study. Also discussed was the role of the IDEAS model as a means for linking theoretical perspectives from instructional design and cognitive science to science educational reform. © 2001 Taylor and Francis Ltd.

AB  - Across the nation, undergraduate faculty and staff in the sciences are being called upon to examine traditional laboratory practices. The Vee map is a graphic organizer that is a viable alternative to one component of the traditional laboratory, the laboratory report. It consists of a large Vee with six areas: Focus Question, Word List, Concept Map, Events, Data and Data Transformations, and Conclusions and Claims. The Focus Question guides the investigation, while the Word List and Concept Map reveal prior knowledge. The Events area is a description of the plan students devise to answer the Focus Question. The collected data are recorded and analyzed in the Data and Data Transformation area, findings and results of the investigation are described in the Conclusions and Claims area. Students proceed through these areas in the above mentioned sequence as they engage in an open-ended laboratory investigation. As students complete a Vee map, they contemplate their prior knowledge, engage in the process of knowledge construction, and build meaningful knowledge. Ultimately, a Vee map is a tool that assists an instructor in creating a more interactive and student-centered laboratory report.

AB  - Student teachers have at their disposal various information sources concerning teaching: their own beliefs, their mentors’ practical knowledge, and ’theory’. Because practical knowledge often remains implicit, the aim of the present study was to explore the appropriateness of two techniques for its articulation: concept mapping and completing sentences. The criterion used was that these should not only elicit descriptions of how to teach, but also the cognitions underlying teaching, i.e., practical knowledge. Thirty-five student teachers and their mentors at a postgraduate teacher-training institute in the Netherlands used both techniques, concerning the subject of ’order’. Subsequently, the students summarized their own beliefs, their mentors’ practical knowledge, and theory and compared these to each other. The student teachers’ reports showed that they, in general, had been able to elicit partially their mentors’ practical knowledge. It was concluded that the use of the techniques involved seemed valuable for student teachers’ learning processes. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conducted in Israel, this research probes students' understanding of the relationships between genetic concepts. Four populations were examined: 9th graders (14-15 year olds), who were exposed to genetics for the first time (n = 184); 12th graders (17-18 year olds), who were studying biology as their main subject (n = 121); college pre-service teachers, who had not yet earned a degree (n = 29); and university pre-service teachers, who had earned biology degrees and were seeking teacher certification (n = 22). Three research Instruments were used: a written questionnaire, interviews, and concept maps. The questions were open-ended to enable the identification of students' patterns of comprehensive thinking and understanding, not identifiable In multiple choice testing. Alternative conceptions and compartmentalisation between related concepts were identified. Based on these findings, genetic instruction in 9th and 12th grade and in college needs improvement.

AB  - We studied the occurrence and nature of learning in a university first year Introduction to Geomorphology course, and its relations with prior knowledge taught in a prerequisite course, and with the prior knowledge in the to be learned subjects. Ten dimensions of knowledge were tapped before and after the course by conventional and cognitive structure measures that were derived by the concept mapping methodology. The fine-grain analysis of learning outcomes yielded the following results: (a) students acquired only a small portion of the content in the course Introduction to Geomorphology, (b) the prior geological and geomorphological knowledge did not affect the learning of the new geomorphological contents, (c) the minor effects appeared within rather than across knowledge dimensions, and they affected mainly the learning of smaller knowledge units, and (d) concept definition cannot be considered a valid probe of knowledge. The differential effects of prior knowledge question the central, global and undifferentiated role that schema theories ascribe to prior knowledge in future learning. They call for greater reference to the exposed dimensions of knowledge by suggesting additional factors to be considered in the sequencing of courses, as well as to the acquisition of complex knowledge with partial meaning of the basic knowledge units, and the use of new cognitive structure probes of knowledge.

AB  - This article describes two related studies that began to explore the validity of scores from select-and-fill-in (SAFI) concept map assessments as measures of students' connected understanding of science. Scores from SAFI maps created for this purpose and used with middle school students and undergraduate astronomy students possessed high internal consistency and exhibited large mean increases with increased domain exposure. SAFI scores were strongly related to scores from a standardized multiple-choice (MC) achievement measure for middle school students; work with individual students suggested that they used strategies requiring connected understanding to successfully complete the maps. SAFI scores from undergraduate students exhibited large relationships with scores from direct-instruction MC exams and scores from a relatedness ratings measure, taken together and separately. Results provide initial evidence of the validity of scores from SAFI maps as measures of connected understanding of science in middle school and undergraduate introductory science students.

AB  - This research investigates the use of patterns in designing adaptable, flexible hypermedia applications. While patterns are particularly applicable to software design, they can also be used to assist designers of other types of applications. We have developed a method (APHID) that guides a hypermedia creator through the analysis and design process. The method ensures that good design principles are followed, both for the hypermedia application and for the interface that presents the hypermedia application. Our method uses a concept map, constraints, and patterns (instructional and presentation) to support partial automation for creating hypermedia applications. We also present a prototype software system that uses the APHID method to create instructional hypermedia applications semi-automatically. The applications created using APHID are tailored to specific types of learners. We conclude with a claim that this approach is applicable not just to instructional hypermedia, but to the larger problem of generating adaptable interfaces. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Task-related variance causes scores from performance assessments not to be generalizable and thus inappropriate for high stakes use. It is possible that task-related variance is due, in part, to students’ inability to transfer their knowledge consistently from one assessment task to another. Therefore, concept-mapping, a cognitive tool, might be useful to aid this transfer. This study examines the effects of concept maps on the task-related variance components of Political Science performance assessments. On three quizzes, some students used concept maps while writing two essays, while other students did not. The task variance components remained unchanged across groups, but the person main effect components increased and the task-by-person interaction components decreased for those using concept maps. Also, the scores from the concept mapping groups had higher generalizability coefficients than for those who did not use a concept map. © 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this paper, a 2 X 2 factorial design was used to assess the main and interaction effects of GSS and facilitation on knowledge restructuring under experimental conditions. To measure knowledge restructuring, the concept mapping technique and similarity coefficient were used to evaluate the level of restructuring of individual structural knowledge (complexity and integration) and the commonality of individual knowledge among the group. Results of the experiment indicated that both GSS and facilitation were effective cognitive tools which could be used to enhance knowledge restructuring. Supplemental analysis revealed that the presence of either GSS or content facilitation improved quality of learners' feedback which was an important factor needed to heighten restructuring of learners' mental models. However the interaction effects of GSS and facilitation on knowledge restructuring were found to be non-additive. © 2000 IEEE

AB  - Integrated science teaching is a task which requires that teachers develop new conceptual structures for the science topics they teach. It is often assumed that changes in teaching can be facilitated through reflective practices such as teacher self-assessment. Does self- assessment in fact help teachers develop new conceptual structures in the context of integrated science? We examine this assumption in the research reported in this paper. In the German PING project - an integrated science project for middle schools - teacher in-service education was based on collaborative workshops in which a group of 22 teachers from different types of schools used teaching materials for eight integrated topics for their lesson planning and conducting units over a period of 30 months. During this time concept maps, interviews and questionnaires were used as means to promote teacher self-assessment. We find that this kind of self-assessment in a collaborative framework was a useful basis for helping science teachers develop integrated conceptual structures and we suggest that in-service courses might use self-assessment for reflection on conceptual content knowledge as a basis for supporting integrated science teaching.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of multimedia authoring, as a learning tool, using the software ASTOUND. The subjects in this study were 32 students in two Grade 12 classes. The context of the study was a multi-disciplinary environmental unit about earthquakes. Students were provided with basic background about earthquakes via laboratory experiments and field trips. At a later stage, the students did in-depth independent projects on selected topics related to earthquakes. Once completed, the students presented their projects using the multimedia software ASTOUND. The research consisted of the following stages: a pre-development phase; curriculum design phase; implementation and evaluation. The research tools included: questionnaires, interviews, observations, concept mapping, and an analysis of the multimedia presentations. The findings showed that an integration of laboratory exercises, field trips, and an independent study project, could lead to meaningful learning. However, although most of the students enjoyed using the multimedia program, there was no evidence to support the assumption that it contributed to knowledge acquisition. In fact, much of the time invested in multimedia authoring was devoted to producing decorative effects, reducing the time available for meaningful learning. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Increasing availability of technologies, such as CD ROMs and the World Wide Web, in schools means that more teachers will have the potential to implement student-centred, inquiry-based approaches to learning. Assessing what each student knows in a broad subject area, such as science, is difficult. Assessing students’ understanding in circumstances where each student may pursue different topics of study, where there is no way to predict in advance what those topics of study will be and where the possible topics of study include natural phenomena which are only beginning to be studied by professional scientists, is even more difficult. The authors recently faced such a challenge. To meet the challenge, the authors chose to assess student learning using an open-ended concept map activity combined with a rubric which extracts quantitative information about the quality of understanding from each map. This article describes the method the authors developed, including tests of reliability and validity. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

AB  - This study investigated the role of talk and writing on learning science. The purpose was to explore the effect of talk, writing, and talk and writing on the learning and retention of simple and integrated knowledge, and to describe the mechanisms by which talk and writing mediate these processes. Forty-three students were randomly assigned to four groups, all stratified for gender and ability. At intervals during an instructional unit, three treatment groups received problem tasks that involved constructing scientific explanations for real-world applications of ecological concepts. A control group received simpler descriptive tasks based on similar content. Students in the talk-only treatment group (T) discussed the problem tasks in small peer groups. Students in the writing-only treatment group (W) individually wrote responses for each of the tasks, but without first talking to other students. Students in the combined talk and writing treatment group (TW) discussed the problems in groups prior to individually writing their explanations. Dependent variables included simple, integrated, and total knowledge scores based on multiple-choice tests, essay questions, and concept maps obtained at three timepoints during the study: a pretest; an immediate posttest; and a delayed posttest. Records of student talk and writing were also analyzed to describe the mechanisms involved. The findings suggest that talk is important for sharing, clarifying, and distributing knowledge among peers, while asking questions, hypothesizing, explaining, and formulating ideas together are all important mechanisms during peer discussions. Analytical writing is an important tool for transforming rudimentary ideas into knowledge that is more coherent and structured. Furthermore, talk combined with writing appears to enhance the retention of science learning over time. Moreover, gender and ability may be important mediating variables that determine the effectiveness of talk and writing for enhancing learning. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Sci Ed 84:566-593, 2000.

AB  - Low-achieving seventh-grade students from an urban parochial school were randomly assigned to two equally sized groups (n = 62, each group). One group was taught by a read-and-discuss, teacher-directed method, and the second group, given the same type of introductory lesson as the first, followed a model of concept mapping that connected major and minor concept ideas. A criterion-referenced test based on the content of a science chapter served as the dependent variable. Prior to any teaching, a pretest was administered. An analysis of covariance with pretest scores as the covariate showed a statistically significant difference in comprehension between the pretest and posttest for the experimental group. Effect size estimates revealed that concept mapping can be expected to improve comprehension scores of low-achieving seventh graders by approximately six standard deviations over a traditional instructional technique. When students lack background information on a topic to aid comprehension, the active participation in constructing semantic or concept maps may help students form a cognitive schema to assimilate and relate the new topic information.

AB  - This study examines the extent to which science education graduate students enjoy a well-articulated position on the compatibility of science and religion and, as a result, are comfortable with their espoused views and plans for the role of religion in science classroom discussions. We were particularly interested in examining changes in student mental states as a legitimate form of conceptual change after a course intervention. This might be evidenced by the depth of understanding, level of reasoning, and degree of comfort with classroom application. The intervention first asked students to write a "talk back to the author" paper shortly after reading a provocative essay on the topic. This was followed by reading and discussing a variety of alternative views after which they wrote a more formal position paper on the science-religion topic. We first conducted a content analysis of both papers, developing separate concept maps of the overall class response in the first and second papers, noting changes in emphases. Adapting a current multidimensional model of conceptual change, we then developed an individual evaluation form based on categories that emerged in the class analysis, which were strikingly similar to the categories in the multidimensional model. These included ontological, epistemological, and social/affective dimensions of conceptual change. Both papers were scored in these three areas. The conceptual change for each student from talk-back to position paper was subsequently reported using individual graphs and citing text examples. Results showed conceptual change or improved mental state in all three categories for most students. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Sci Ed 84:445-468, 2000.

AB  - In this article we present the results of an experimental study of the influence of task characteristics on the characteristics of elaboration of conceptual knowledge in social interaction. With a pre-test and post-test we measured individual learning outcomes. We constructed a coding scheme that focuses on the communicative functions and propositional content of utterances and on elaborative episodes. The subjects were 40 students who worked in dyads on a collaborative task about electricity in one of four conditions. We compared a concept mapping task with a poster task and investigated the effect of a phase of individual preparation. The post-test scores were significantly higher than the pre-test scores. Individual preparation created better learning results and the asking of more questions. The concept mapping conditions showed more discussion of electricity concepts, collaboratively elaborated conflicts and reasoning, but no higher individual learning outcomes. In the concept mapping conditions, elaboration was related to individual learning outcomes. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes a qualitative approach 10 analysing students' concept maps. The classification highlights three major patterns which are referred to as 'spoke', 'chain' and 'net' structures. Examples are given from Year 8 science classes. The patterns are interpreted as being indicators of progressive levels of understanding. It is proposed that identification of these differences may help the classroom teacher to focus teaching for more effective learning and may be used as a basis for structuring groups in collaborative settings. This approach to analysing concept maps is of value because it suggests teaching approaches that help students integrate new knowledge and build upon their existing naïve concepts. We also refer to the teacher's scheme of work and to the National Curriculum for science in order to consider their influence in the construction of understanding. These ideas have been deliberately offered for early publication to encourage debate and generate feedback. Further work is in progress to better understand how students with different conceptual structures can be most appropriately helped to achieve learning development.

AB  - The authors describe two teaching tools, case-based learning and concept mapping, and how they support cross-disciplinary, multidisciplinary, and interdisciplinary learning, use a biopsychosocial model, and promote the integration of sex- and gender-based science into the medical curriculum. The process of case development at MCP Hahnemann University (MCPHU) is outlined in detail for a specific case. That case, which integrates three different components of women's health, is then presented in full. The authors then provide an example of a concept map dealing with women and alcohol use; the map defines current knowledge and serves as a blueprint for developing curricular goals and learning objectives for the topic. Properly constructed concept maps and cases help teach patient-centered approaches to problem solving, address sex- and gender-based differences in disease as well as in pathophysiology and pharmacology, integrate psychosocial issues - such as family dynamics, environmental stressors, access to health care, effective gender-based communication between patient and provider, and cultural variations - along with biomedical ones, and encourage a multidisciplinary approach to patient care. The authors maintain that these tools might be used to transform medical education by making it more integrated and interdisciplinary.

AB  - Computerized problem-based learning (PBL) cases were developed that replicate the critical thinking process undertaken by students during traditional facilitator-led PBL sessions. Eight computerized PBL cases emphasizing medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutics concepts were developed initially from among those used previously during facilitator-led sessions. Two case versions were developed: one incorporating concept maps emphasizing key ideas and another lacking the maps. Quiz scores and attitudes were measured and compared among students using the computerized PBL cases (with and without maps) and the previous year's class who attended only facilitator-led sessions. Scores on the 12 quizzes administered did not differ significantly among the different student groups. Students consistently felt that the PBL sessions improved their problem-solving skills, use of information resources, and communication/interaction skills. Computerized PBL cases can be a useful alternative to facilitator-led sessions to reduce faculty time demands in this process while retaining the benefits.

AB  - The article sets the context in which primary science educators find themselves, following the publication in England and Wales of the two recent DfEE circulars (10/97 and 4/98), Teaching: High Status, High Standards. The implications of trainee teachers demonstrating a wide range of standards, both of teaching ability and personal subject knowledge levels, by the end of their courses, are considered. The research was carried out by questioning staff from 32 teacher training institutions, who attended a conference in the early summer of 1998, where the focus was looking at strategies for auditing and enhancing trainee teachers’ subject knowledge. The results indicated that few institutions had foreseen the changes by previously planning for the introduction of subject auditing of trainees, but that all institutions had plans afoot for introducing it both on entry, and during the course. Techniques were based mainly around student self-assessment, monitored by tutors, using strategies such as evidence portfolios, concept mapping, etc. Strategies such as multiple-choice testing and computer assessment were envisaged as being used to a lesser extent. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Concept maps have been used extensively in science education both to promote and to measure meaningful learning. This study examines the use of concept maps to measure tertiary science students' understanding of fundamental concepts in statistical inference. Different methods of scoring maps are examined, and a revised scheme developed. Student scores on concept maps of two aspects of statistics, namely problem definition and statistical inference, are compared before and after a practical statistical investigation conducted by the students. The concept map scores are also compared with marks awarded for the practical assignment. While there was no significant improvement in concept map scores over time, some significant correlations were found between aspects of the concept map scores and scores on the practical assignment. Valuable qualitative information can be gained from an investigation of student concept maps, which enables clarification of student misconceptions, and which cannot be obtained from traditional assessment methods. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Two instructional methods (teacher centered and student centered) were compared in a non-laboratory-based environmental science course for college undergraduates. Students in 2 teacher-centered (traditional) classes (n = 46 and n = 45) were presented material in standard lecture fashion for 90 min twice a week. Students in 2 student-centered (constructivist) classes (n = 48 and n = 42) worked in small, heterogeneous groups on thought-provoking scenarios and critical thinking questions or constructed concept maps on the information of the day; material was presented to the students in question-discussion fashion. Identical materials, learning resources, student questionnaires, and examinations were used for both populations. Students in constructivist classes performed significantly better on exams, rated the course higher, and participated more in campus and regional environmental support efforts than students in traditional classes. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A method used in program evaluation and public health research called concept mapping is examined in this article for its usefulness in feminist research. This method embodies several defining characteristics of feminist social science. Concept mapping is a single method that integrates qualitative and quantitative approaches, provides an opportunity for participants to work together as a group to develop an understanding of a concept, and places the participants in control of interpretation. Over the course of a six-step process, a group of people are assembled to discuss an issue or concept, moving toward a group understanding of that concept, which is then represented in a visual picture, or map. Concept mapping was used in the current study to examine how community resources for sexual-assault victims could be improved. A national random sample of 168 rape-victim advocates provided ideas as to how the legal, medical, and mental health systems could better serve victims. A subgroup of advocates then constructed and interpreted a concept map. The map suggested that rape victims still face many problems in seeking community help. Twelve clusters of broad-based and specific system changes were identified (e.g., fighting victim blaming, community education, sensitizing medical staff, legal reform). Implications for research on sexual assault and feminist research methodology are discussed.

AB  - This study examined the roles that students' science concepts play in promoting teachers' professional growth. Two cohorts of teachers (N = 26 and 30) participated in the study as part of a constructivist-based graduate course on elementary and middle school science methods. A modified learning cycle was used during course instruction as a framework for teachers to explore sound, light, and electricity. Data on teachers' pedagogical and conceptual growth was obtained from pre-and postconcept maps, journal reflections, and portfolios. Results of the concept map analysis showed that teachers' maps became more integrated and cohesive as seen in the increase of crosslinks, hierarchies, and relationships drawn for each science topic. The journals and portfolios showed that students' science knowledge served as discrepant events that evoked teachers' dissatisfaction with their own content knowledge and motivated them to reconsider their pedagogical practices. Students' concepts also served as change agents, resulting in changes in teachers' views of their roles and instructional behaviors. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Sci Ed 83: 545-557, 1999.

AB  - This study employed the case study methodology, focusing on three students engaged in a group task. The students were grouped together based on their learning style and cognitive control differences: one student was an Assimilator/Field-Independent; another, a Converger/Field-Mixed; and the third, an Accommodator/Field-Dependent. The group task was to develop a concept map on hypermedia-related concepts. Our research focus was to determine how each of three students influenced the construction of the group concept map with their learning styles and cognitive controls framing our analyses. The data sources used were (1) their individual concept maps which they used during the group task, (2) the group concept map, (3) the transcriptions of the dialogue that took place when completing the group task, (4) their hypermedia knowledge, (5) their hypermedia experience, (6) features they identified as comprising a hypermedia environment, and (7) hypermedia insights. We found that the Assimilator/Field-Independent student was the most influential by having (1) the greatest similarity between her individual concept map and the group map, (2) the highest number of concepts added and the fewest number of concepts omitted, (3) the highest number of hypermedia features that were also included in the group concept map, and (4) the most complex links between concepts. The next influential was the Converger/Field-Mixed. The least influential was the Accommodator/Field-Dependent. Explanations are given from the learning style/cognitive control perspective. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We reviewed the process of using concept mapping as a methodology to teach science to RNs in a bachelor degree of nursing program in Australia. METHOD: The technique was used for two classes of students in the science unit during 1995 with work packages and independent student learning being the focus of the unit. RESULTS: Both instructors and students found the experience mainly positive. It helped the students become more independent learners, have a greater confidence in their knowledge of science, and allowed their understanding of science in their practice to become more meaningful and personalized. For the instructors it allowed them to concentrate on students with learning difficulties because they had less face-to-face teaching hours. Major issues arising from the process related to how to balance science content and the techniques of concept mapping and how to more effectively assess the learning outcomes of the students. CONCLUSION: Concept mapping is a useful technique to link science and nursing practice. Not only can it be used in academic programs to teach the science underlying practice, it can be used in the clinical area to teach patients. As a technique it works well in staff development and continuing education where the focus is on elucidating the rationale for inuring practice and providing evidence for the value of this practice.

AB  - This study used concept map content analysis and interviews to gain insights into the knowledge organisation and knowledge processing of pre-service teachers. Forty-eight preservice teachers of elementary science from a teachers' training college in Sarawak, Malaysia, participated in this study. Correlations between achievement and five concept map characteristics showed that there were significant positive correlations (p < .01) between achievement and: the number of appropriate links; the average number of appropriate concepts per cluster; and, the hierarchy score of subjects' concept maps, and significant negative correlations (p < .01) between achievement and: the number of inappropriate links; and, the average number of inappropriate concepts per cluster. Interviews with high-achievers and low-achievers revealed that there were differences in the way they processed knowledge during concept mapping. The high-achievers were more thorough than were the low-achievers in cognitive processing of knowledge, taking time to make sense of concepts, son and group concepts, form relevant links between concepts, and organise concepts hierarchically. Active cognitive processing of knowledge seems to be related to more complex, well-integrated cognitive structures for the material learned.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of two different types of interviews - one that did (POSTICM) and one that did not (POSTI) embed a concept-mapping process - to elicit students' postinstructional understandings about chlorofluorocarbons and their role in global atmospheric change (GAC). A chief criterion measure was accordance, the degree to which students held the ideal postinstructional understanding set forth in a teacher-expert concept map. After GAC instruction that included concept-mapping activities, 34 eighth-grade science students were assigned randomly to groups and completed either POSTICM or POSTI. These students and their teacher also completed relatedness ratings of central concepts from the teacher-expert map. The Knowledge Network Organizing Tool™ was used to transform relatedness ratings to Pathfinder networks and compare nets to yield a student to teacher similarity index (Pathfinder index). Regression analysis revealed that type of interview did not predict accordance. However, most POSTICM students perceived the concept-mapping interview component to be helpful and affect positively their answers to the interview questions. The Pathfinder index did predict (p = .003) accordance - the Pathfinder index was a reliable confirmatory measure of the degree to which students held the ideal postinstructional understanding.

AB  - The dual role of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in global atmospheric change, and the related feedbacks between ozone-layer depletion and greenhouse warming, reflect the complexity of climate-change issues. Science instruction that targets such issues can make a vital contribution to global scientific literacy from an Earth-systems perspective. This study focused on global atmospheric change instruction for eighth-grade students. Pre-instructional interviews revealed that over 60 percent of students had little to no understanding of CFCs; about 30 percent connected them to ozone-layer destruction, and a few had misconceptions about the ozone hole heating up earth. An analysis of students' post-instructional concept maps suggested that knowledge about CFCs was limited to their role in ozone-layer depletion. Post-instructional interview transcripts corroborated these findings and revealed further that about 30 percent held the misconception that CFCs cause global warming by depleting the ozone layer and letting in more ultraviolet rays or sunlight. These findings suggest that instruction on the role of CFCs in global atmospheric change needs to clarify further the differences between infrared and ultraviolet radiation and might emphasize the greenhouse nature of CFCs prior to dealing with their role in ozone-layer depletion.

AB  - Major changes are underway in accounting education, in part because of the encouragement of the Accounting Education Change Commission (AECC). To extend learning beyond the formal curriculum, the AECC advocates that accounting educators help students develop the ability to 'learn how to learn.' A learning technique called concept mapping, widely accepted in science education, is described in this paper. Concept mapping allows students to understand how they learn and how new knowledge is constructed. Students can then use this technique to 'learn how to learn' and carry knowledge absorption beyond their college experience. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research evaluates the effects of a scaffolded explanation-based approach to collaborative discussion on students' understanding of photosynthesis. This approach consists of instruction and prompts encouraging students to engage in the processes of explaining and justifying one's personal knowledge and comparing it to scientific knowledge. Forty-eight 4th- and 5th-grade students, identified as having high or average "intentional" approaches to learning, were divided into 3 groups (high, average control [AC], and average intervention [AI]). Students worked both collaboratively and individually on 2 reasoning tasks (problem-explanation and concept maps) in the domain of photosynthesis. The results of the concept-mapping tasks indicated that the students in the AI group developed a more accurate scientific and functional understanding of photosynthesis than the AC group who did not receive the intervention. This study also confirmed the prediction that the AI group would more closely resemble the high intentional learning group by constructing explanations that were conceptually more advanced as well as retaining and acquiring more subject matter knowledge than those of the AC group. The scaffolded explanation-based intervention did not have a significant effect on the structure of students' explanations. This research supports the importance of the nature of students' discussion (i.e., explanation) to advance their beliefs about scientific phenomena and emphasizes the usefulness of explanation and concept-mapping techniques as evaluative measures of student knowledge during collaborative problem solving.

AB  - This study show different works done in the context of social sciences learning and teaching, which pose the concept maps methodology as an assessment and research tool more in agreement with the changes in the recent educational approaches. First, we present a general view of social science learning approach. Secondly, we show how concept maps can be an effective tool for research in this field and help to solve some difficulties of the more traditional techniques of knowledge assessment. Thirdly, we describe an application - an analogical assessment of conceptual knowledge with the methodology of concept maps, and their educational implications.

AB  - This study involved 20 research participants who created group concept maps on the term "hypermedia." The purpose of the study was to determine whether groups, membership of which was based on a mixture of learning styles or a mixture of hypermedia knowledge, constructed concept maps that differed in terms of number of concepts, number of nodes, number of links, number of bidirectional links, number of multiple concept nodes, number of nodes with multiple links, and varying levels of hierarchical relationships. It was found that the group comprised of two convergers, one assimilator, and one diverger, all of whom had a high level of hypermedia knowledge, was the most productive. Of the 11 measures, they produced the most for 7 of them. We were also interested in determining the interactive dynamics that either learning style or hypermedia knowledge played as the participants constructed their group concept maps. We audiotaped their interactions and categorized their comments and actions within the learning style traits associated with being either a converger, a diverger, an assimilator, or an accommodator. Learning style seemed to explain the types of interactions more than hypermedia knowledge did. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This paper investigates one particular contribution of hypertext to knowledge construction: the transition from declarative knowledge to structural knowledge. The proposed model hypothesizes that the navigational structure of hypertext provides a framework to the learner for integrating new information with previously acquired knowledge and should hence facilitate the acquisition of structural knowledge. The results of an empirical study designed to compare the effect of hypertext on the construction of structural knowledge, as measured by concept maps, to that of linear text (both hard and soft) support the predictions of the model. The implications of these results on the design of the hypertext navigational structure are discussed.

AB  - The problem addressed by this study is that first-year college chemistry students learn little of the conceptual material associated with chemistry experiments they perform. The thesis of this research is that the construction of prelab and postlab concept maps help students understand the concepts involved in the experiments they perform. The study was conducted using 32 non-science majors enrolled in a first-year chemistry course. The experimental group constructed prelab and postlab concept maps, while the control group wrote essays explaining the conceptual chemistry of the four experiments used in this study. Both groups took 25-item achievement tests 1 week after each experiment. Prelab and postlab concept maps were scored and evaluated for significant differences. Five students were interviewed to investigate their perceptions regarding the usefulness of concept maps in chemistry laboratories. No significant differences were found between treatment groups with respect to students' conceptual understanding as determined by the multiple choice achievement tests. Students responded very positively toward the use of concepts maps in the laboratory. They felt strongly that constructing prelab and postlab concept maps helped them understand the conceptual chemistry of the experiments. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - This yearlong study was implemented in seventh-grade life science classes with the students' regular teacher serving as teacher/researcher. In the study, a method of scoring concept maps was developed to assess knowledge and comprehension levels of science achievement. By linking scoring of concept maps to instructional objectives, scores were based upon the correctness of propositions. High correlations between the concept map scores and unit multiple choice tests provided strong evidence of the content validity of the map scores. Similarly, correlations between map scores and state criterion-referenced and national norm-referenced standardized tests were indicators of high concurrent validity. The approach to concept map scoring in the study represents a distinct departure from traditional methods that focus on characteristics such as hierarchy and branching. A large body of research has demonstrated the utility of such methods in the assessment of higher-level learning outcomes. The results of the study suggest that a concept map might be used in assessing declarative and procedural knowledge, both of which have a place in the science classroom. One important implication of these results is that science curriculum and its corresponding assessment need not be dichotomized into knowledge/comprehension versus higher-order outcomes. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - The study was designed to assess the effectiveness of use of the concept mapping technique in the learning of science subjects by Arab students in a preparatory school second grade, located in the Gaza Strip. Concept mapping is a schematic device for representing a set of concept meanings embedded in a framework of propositions. The subjects of this study were randomly assigned to the two regularly scheduled classes, and each class was assigned to either experimental or control conditions. In the control class, the teaching approach was primarily teacher orientated, that is the teacher used the lecturing method in sequencing the instructional activities. In the case of the experimental class, the concept mapping approach added the generation of propositional relationships among concepts on maps, using the same content material. The results of this study indicated that the experimental class subjects achieved better than those of the control class.

AB  - We examined the implementation of a laser-disk based science curriculum in an elementary school. The goal was to develop a richer understanding of the principles for designing a curriculum that will adequately support teachers in adopting a learner-centered framework. Issues included: who has ownership of the classroom discussion; what types of activities are engaged in terms of the constraints imposed; and what is the teacher's response to the specific tools provided (the teacher's guide, the Circle of Learning, and concept maps). In addition to looking at the implementation pattern, we also examined the impact of the implementation on student attitudes and anxiety toward science. Results indicated little adoption of the curriculum, and teachers continued to maintain a high degree of control in the classroom. However, results also indicated significant effects of the curriculum on science attitude and. anxiety. Suggestions for future research are included. © 1997 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - The quantitative Knowledge Space Theory is applied here for the first time to specific science concepts in order to evaluate its feasibility as a general assessment method for science learning. In particular, the knowledge states of students in the 4th through 12th grades are suggested for three science concepts before and after classroom teaching/learning experiences. The theory belongs to the vast category of latent trait models based upon the Rasch model, but differs in all its most important characteristics by having the power to extract the cognitive organization of the material. Student responses to the pre-tests and the post-tests were analyzed for the pressure concept, the density concept and the conservation of matter, and tentative critical learning pathways for each concept are suggested which describe the most probable sequences of learning steps. In all three cases the quantitative results show a change in the students’ logic structure after the classroom experience. Knowledge Space Theory shows considerable promise for providing a useful quantitative analysis technique for assessing and analyzing the knowledge of students when used with other assessment methods such as concept mapping and clinical interviews. Ultimately, exemplary strategies and materials may be identified by this procedure for helping teachers effectively move students along the most probable critical learning pathways as suggested by the students themselves. © 1997, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study explored students' conceptual understanding and conceptual growth regarding classical mechanics in the natural context of a Grade-level 10 science classroom. The purpose of the study was to determine the pervasiveness of a pattern observed in an earlier study in which learners initially gave evidence of scientifically valid knowledge structures but then returned or regressed to an earlier, primitive level of understanding. In the current study, concept mapping and interview methods were used to capture students' construction of knowledge patterns across a survey course designed to focus on some big ideas in physics The analyses of mean ratings of student-generated concept maps and interview transcripts over three data collections did not consistently reveal the progression-regression patterns across the instruction as observed in the earlier study. The students' knowledge structures remained stable across the 10 weeks and remained unchanged 4 weeks after instruction ceased, suggesting that very little construction or restructuring of knowledge was taking place, and possibly worse, that the students' existing knowledge was not challenged sufficiently to promote the construction or reconstruction process. Implications of the alternative interpretations are discussed. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Two unobtrusive diagnostic game-like instruments, especially designed to determine junior high school science teachers’ meaningful understanding of functional relationships, between some of the basic concepts related to the abstract notion of the ‘living cell’, are described in this paper. The basic assumption was that teachers, although apparently familiar with each of the relevant concepts separately, do not perceive many of the relationships which confer upon them their ‘meaning’, in an Ausubelian sense. A concept map, specifically adapted to the level expected from junior high-school teachers, was designed and validated by scientists. While readily playing the ‘games’, individual teachers displayed the type and the relevance of the relationships which they established between concepts, their level of meaningful understanding (area covered on the exemplary concept-map), and its availability (spontaneity of use). The main outcomes of this study show that quite often, teachers do not spontaneously establish connections between concepts and therefore do not perceive the implications of their otherwise correct declarative knowledge. © 1997, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the knowledge base of a group of science teachers in terms of their knowledge of the structure, function, and development of their disciplines, and their understanding of the nature of science. The study also aimed to relate the teachers' knowledge base to their level of education, years of teaching experience, and the class level(s) that they teach. Twenty inservice science teachers were selected to respond to a modified version of the Views on Science-Technology-Society (VOSTS) questionnaire to assess their understanding of the nature of science. The teachers then constructed concept maps and were interviewed. The concept maps were scored and the interviews analyzed to assess teachers' knowledge of the structure, function, and development of their disciplines. The teachers' knowledge base was found to be lacking in all respects. Teachers held several naive views about the nature of science and did not demonstrate adequate knowledge and understanding of the structure, function, and development of their disciplines. Moreover, the teachers' knowledge base did not relate to their years of teaching experience, the class level(s) that they teach, and their level of education. It was reasoned that teacher preparation programs are not helping teachers develop the knowledge base needed for teaching science.

AB  - This study examined successive and progressive changes in the structural complexity of knowledge held by introductory, college-level biology students and how those changes are affected by the students' primary learning mode and gender. To examine the way learners restructure knowledge over the course of a semester, subjects constructed concept maps at 4-week intervals throughout the term. The maps were then evaluated for structural complexity and change based on the works of other investigators. Results suggest that a substantial amount of knowledge restructuring takes place and that much of it is incremental in nature; "accretion" and "tuning" accounting for 75% of the observed structural changes. Of potential importance, however, is that "radical" changes involving higher order, superordinate concepts are concentrated in the first 4 weeks of the semester. The observed relationships between knowledge restructuring and predominant learning mode and gender of students are potentially significant. The evidence suggests that students who use "active," "deep " information processing strategies construct more elaborate, well-differentiated knowledge structures. Furthermore, it appears that gender may be an important mediator of meaningful learning. It is particularly notable that where gender differences were found, they tended to favor females. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - An innovative, conceptually based instructional model for teaching large undergraduate astronomy courses was designed, implemented, and evaluated in the Fall 1995 semester. This model was based on cognitive and educational theories of knowledge and, we believe, is applicable to other large postsecondary science courses. Major components were: (a) identification of the basic important concepts and their interrelationships that are necessary for connected understanding of astronomy in novice students; (b) use of these concepts and their interrelationships throughout the design, implementation, and evaluation stages of the model; (c) identification of students' prior knowledge and misconceptions; and (d) implementation of varied instructional strategies targeted toward encouraging conceptual understanding in students (i.e., instructional concept maps, cooperative small group work, homework assignments stressing concept application, and a conceptually based student assessment system). Evaluation included the development and use of three measures of conceptual understanding and one of attitudes toward studying astronomy. Over the semester, students showed very large increases in their understanding as assessed by a conceptually based multiple-choice measure of misconceptions, a select-and-fill-in concept map measure, and a relatedness-ratings measure. Attitudes, which were slightly positive before the course, changed slightly in a less favorable direction. © 1997 American Association of Physics Teachers.

AB  - In Novak's "concept mapping", fully constructed "concept map" is shown to subjects before and/or after mapping work. As it takes too much time to get satisfactory results, in this study map completion tasks were introduced. Subjects were to insert some of the suitable concepts or lines into the blanks to make up the map wholly. In preliminary experiments the difficulty of getting satisfactory results were tested. In Exp. I, map completion task with some blanks of concepts are found to be the most effctive. In Exp. II, time spent on this task were manipulated. Subjects had negative effects when only 5 minutes were allowed. When 25 minutes were spent on this task in a 50 minute-experiment, subjects had the best positive effects.

AB  - Cognitive/concept mapping is an educational strategy that takes into consideration the principles of educational psychology. The most important single factor that influences learning is what the learner already knows. Nursing students face a great need to understand the larger questions and problems of their chosen field. Unless there is understanding, students may only commit unassimilated data to short-term memory and no meaningful learning will occur. The purpose of the following paper is to present concept mapping as a learning/teaching strategy for nursing students and nursing faculty. Examples of maps will be presented along with suggestions about how they can be used to plan care for a particular client or to learn more about the nursing care of a specific disease process.

AB  - Concept mapping is an educational tool that encourages meaninful learning fostering meaningful and self-directed learning among medical students is now recognized as a major goal of medical educators (ACME-TRI Report, 1992). Meaningful learning (learning with understanding) is much stronger and longer-lasting than rote learning (learning by memorization) because students address the conceptual meaning of the knowledge being learned, and link this new information with previous knowledge. Concept mapping is an active, creative, visual and spatial learning activity in which concepts are organized according to their hierarchical relationships. Linking words are used to describe the relationships among the concepts. To create a concept map, students must understand the information that will appear in the map. Students must also relate and integrate the concepts that will be recorded in the map. As a result students replace unidirectional linear organization with thinking which proceeds in multiple directions. This improves long-term information retention, reduces verbatim retention of nonmeaningful information, and improves transfer of knowledge in future problem solving activities. interested students and faculty can acquire concept mapping skill through a 2-3 hour workshop. Participants are given a brief overview of meaningful learning and concept mapping. Then, with guidance from workshop facilitators, they create their own concept maps. Next, a debriefing session is held for participants to discuss their experience with concept mapping. Finally, to consolidate and enhance newly developed concept mapping skills, follow-up mapping activities are assigned. Once students acquire concept mapping skill, they can use it to: (1) organize and integrate information; (2) assess existing knowledge; (3) gain insights into new and existing knowledge; and (4) relate basic science concepts to clinical presentation of the patient. Students can continue to use concept mapping as they go through clinical clerkships and residency programs. As practicing physicians they can use the method to gain a meaningful understanding of new concepts and to integrate these new concepts with prior concepts retained in long-term memory.

AB  - This research addressed children’s difficulty in learning science meaningfully. A Wittgensteinian analysis of meanings suggests that they arise in successful acts of communication in the context of specific types of shared activity. From this perspective, communication between pupils in using scientific ideas should provide a worthwhile, effective learning task. Concept mapping provides a means of structuring discussion about scientific meanings. The research used primarily qualitative approaches to investigate the potential for collaborative concept mapping to improve 9- to 11-year-old children’s learning in science. Analysis of the talk in pupil groups identified the processes at work in the discussion. The structure of the discussion differed substantially from common patterns of classroom talk, often involving children in collaborative construction of the relationships shown in the concept maps. The findings show concept mapping to be beneficial for learning, and to support sustained small-group discussion of scientific ideas. © 1997, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper reports on the use of a HyperCard™-based tool to create and modify concept maps about science related subject matter. The tool was trialed with seventy-one preservice teachers who were planning to teach a science topic to a primary school class. Data gathered from interviews, journals and analysis of concept maps indicated that the concept mapping tool was easy to use because it generated little cognitive load and quickly became transparent to the users. This allowed preservice teachers to focus their attention upon the construction of their maps and to organise their cognitive frameworks into more powerful integrated patterns. It was also found that the process of concept map construction may enhance preservice teacher thinking about effective teaching.

AB  - Today's work may very well encompass team work through direct contact with other workers. However, an evolution in the way we work together is taking place. The INTERNET, groupware, video teleconferencing, and distance learning are just some of the examples of collaborative technologies being inserted in the marketplace. Real world environments still include face-to-face transactions but now increasingly encompass distributed electronic transactions facilitated through computing/video media. Human factors - as an interdisciplinary science - may not have been sufficiently developed to move toward a macro-view of collaborative technology. As a result, human factors analysis of 'team error' may have been nearsighted and shallow. Also such analyses - if completed at all - tend to emanate from a traditional cognitive psychology bias. In turn, the paper develops an alternative perspective utilizing ecological psychology to study and interpret human interaction within collaborative systems. From that perspective, the creation of a 'Living Laboratory' is explored whereupon three paradigms to study collaborative processes are presented. Associated assessment tools (e.g., concept mapping and protocol analysis) are discussed as catalysts to synergize this perspective. Implications highlight the 'Living Laboratory' as a vehicle to inform the development of a prototype ecological group interface.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to offer a different methodology for teaching and learning in continuing nursing education and staff development. This article describes a qualitative research study that analyzed how linkages are made between theoretical material and clinical nursing practice. Findings indicate that nursing students did not link the elements of nursing process together, that clinical preparation was not linked to theoretical material, that the meaning students made of the information was different than the instructors' and that concepts from the basic sciences were not incorporated into student meaning structures. Implications for the use of concept maps as an educational strategy in continuing nursing education are drawn.

Data were collected in three typical situations: very limited concept mapping experience with free-style concept mapping; some concept mapping experience with questions provided; extensive concept mapping experience with a list of concepts provided for. It was found that Novak’s scoring scheme was not internally consistent, and therefore there was generally no significant correlation between students’ scores on concept mapping and students’ scores on conventional classroom achievement assessments. The need for a new scoring scheme when concept mapping is used as an alternative science assessment is discussed. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - The search for new, authentic science assessments of what students know and can do is well under way. This has unearthed measures of students' hands-on performance in carrying out science investigations, and has been expanded to discover more or less direct measures of students' knowledge structures. One potential finding is concept mapping, the focus of this review. A concept map is a graph consisting of nodes representing concepts and labeled lines denoting the relation between a pair of nodes. A student's concept map is interpreted as representing important aspects of the organization of concepts in his or her memory (cognitive structure). In this article we characterize a concept map used as an assessment tool as: (a) a task that elicits evidence bearing on a student's knowledge structure in a domain, (b) a format for the student's response, and (c) a scoring system by which the student's concept map can be evaluated accurately and consistently. Based on this definition, multiple concept-mapping techniques were found from the myriad of task, response format, and scoring system variations identified in the literature. Moreover, little attention has been paid to the reliability and validity of these variations. The review led us to arrive at the following conclusions: (a) an integrative working cognitive theory is needed to begin to limit this variation in concept-mapping techniques for assessment purposes; (b) before concept maps are used for assessment and before map scores are reported to teachers, students, the public, and policy makers, research needs to provide reliability and validity information on the effect of different mapping techniques; and (c) research on students' facility in using concept maps, on training techniques, and on the effect on teaching is needed if concept map assessments are to be used in classrooms and in large-scale accountability systems.

AB  - Concept maps have been used to present information and to facilitate learning by students constructing their own maps, but there have been few studies on concept maps as a tool for research into the nature of student learning and the evaluation of the effectiveness of teaching. In setting concept mapping exercises two main issues have been identified, the framework in which students construct their maps (ie the instructions and assistance provided) and procedures for analyzing complete maps. Students taking a history course at a distance, generated concept maps after studying an introductory teaching unit on quantum mechanics. Analysis of the maps and comparison with the unit authors’map showed students’failure to identify‘radiation’as a central concept and to make links between concepts considered essential by the authors. Inspection of the teaching material indicated that‘radiation’as a central concept was implicit rather than directly explained. Analysis of students’descriptions of relationships between concepts identified different levels of description, with a group of students consistently responding at higher level than the rest of the sample. The study confirmed the usefulness of concept maps as a tool for research and evaluation and their potential for development as qualitative measures of learning. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - This study, conducted in an inner‐city middle school, followed the conceptual changes shown in 25 students' writing over a 12‐week science unit. Conceptual changes for 6 target students are reported. Student understanding was assessed regarding the nature of matter and physical change by paper‐and‐pencil pretest and posttest. The 6 target students were interviewed about the goal concepts before and after instruction. Students' writing during lesson activities provided qualitative data about their understandings of the goal concepts across the science unit. The researcher constructed concept maps from students' written statements and compared the maps across time to assess changes in the schema of core concepts, complexity, and organization as a result of instruction. Target students' changes were studied in detail to determine patterns of conceptual change. After patterns were located in target students' maps, the remaining 19 students' maps were analyzed for similar patterns. The ideas that students identified in their writing showed changes in central concepts, complexity, and organization as the lessons progressed. When instructional events were analyzed in relation to students' demonstrated ideas, understanding of the goal conceptions appeared in students' writing more often when students had opportunities to explain their new ideas orally and in writing.

AB  - This study sought further evidence of the concurrent validity of concept mapping as a research and evaluation tool in science education. Specifically, the study examined the extent to which differences exist in the concept maps of advanced college biology majors (N = 25) and beginning nonmajors (N = 25) in the domain of mammals. Furthermore, it explored whether these differences are reflected in the way subjects assign class membership as revealed in a card sorting task. The results indicate that concept maps of biology majors are structurally more complex than those of nonmajors and that differences in the structural complexity and organizational patterns depicted in concept maps are reflected in the underlying dimensions used to assign class membership. Together, these findings suggest that the concept map provides a theoretically powerful and psychometrically sound tool for assessing conceptual change in experimental and classroom settings.

AB  - The study reported here is part of a larger project designed to understand the construction of meaning during collaborative concept mapping. The focus of this report is the teacher who engages students through the emerging concept maps in reflections about their knowledge of scientific concepts and how they are integrated in a larger framework. It is based on data collected over a two‐year span with about 150 students in ten sections of junior and senior physics. The data include video‐taped concept‐mapping sessions, concept maps produced during these sessions and those produced individually at home, reflective essays by the students, and the teacher’s reflective notes. Based on the data sources, three major dimensions were constructed. First, concept maps served as conscription devices which enlisted the participation of students and their teacher who constructed and used them for a variety of purposes. Second, the teacher engaged students in reflections about their knowledge through the conscription device and in his role as a coach‐facilitator‐guide. Third, in this role, the teacher conducted dynamic assessments of student understanding which were then used to intervene to help students construct meaning of scientific concepts compatible with scientific knowledge. This process of evaluation and intervention by the teacher was conceptualized as coach‐facilitator‐guide in the metaphor of the reflective practitioner. We conclude that, in our construction, collaborative concept mapping becomes a context which can assist teachers in changing their referents of action from objectivist to constructivist metaphors of teaching. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article examines the impact of a specially designed in‐service model on teacher understanding of selected science concepts. The underlying idea of the model is to get teachers to restructure their own understanding of a selected science topic by having them study the structure and evolution of their students' ideas on the same topic. Concepts on topics from the life, earth, and physical sciences served as the content focus and middle school Grades 4–9 served as the context for this study. The in‐service experience constituting the main treatment in the study occurred in three distinct phases. In the initial phase, participating teachers interviewed several of their own students to find out what kinds of preconceptions students had about a particular topic. The teachers used concept mapping strategies learned in the in‐service to facilitate the interviews. Next the teachers teamed with other teachers with similar topic interests and a science expert to evaluate and explore the scientific merit of the student conceptual frameworks and to develop instructional units, including a summative assessment during a summer workshop. Finally, the student ideas were further evaluated and explored as the teachers taught the topics in their classrooms during the fall term. Concept maps were used to study changes in teacher understanding across the phases of the in‐service in a repeated‐measures design. Analysis of the maps showed significant growth in the number of valid propositions expressed by teachers between the initial and final mappings in all topic groups. But in half of the groups, this long‐term growth was interrupted by a noticeable decline in the number of valid propositions expressed. In addition, analysis of individual teacher maps showed distinctive patterns of initial invalid conceptions being replaced by new invalid conceptions in later mappings. The combination of net growth of valid propositions and the patterns of evolving invalid conceptions is discussed in constructivist terms. Copyright © 1993 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - The research reported in this article addressed the fundamental question, What do students believe about the nature of the world around them? The research specifically addressed college students' fundamental beliefs about nature, that is, the natural world. Data were collected via semistructured interviews involving a set of elicitation devices used to encourage students to talk about the natural world. The analysis of interview transcripts yielded inferences about student fundamental beliefs based on logicostructural world view theory. These beliefs are presented in the form of a concept map and characterized by a set of bipolar descriptive codes: naturalism and religion; chaos and order; mystery and knowledge; function and purpose; mundane and special; science/no science. Perhaps the most intriguing observation of the study was science's apparent lack of influence on students' beliefs about nature even though these students had been successful in college level science courses.

AB  - This paper describes part of the preliminary data analysis of a research project entitled ‘Emergent Environmentalism’, funded by the E.S.R.C. It provides a brief overview of the theoretical background of the project as a whole which is concerned with the nature and development of children's early knowledge and awareness of environmental issues. One of the four component studies of the research project, namely ‘Emergent Knowledge of The Environment’, is then described and discussed. This provides data which illuminate the extent to which four‐year‐old children know and understand about four selected environmental issues, the sources of their knowledge and an idea of whether they have any sense of concern for the world in which they are growing up. Examples of concept maps that have been constructed for each subject are provided which demonstrate that pre‐school children may well have a strong base of accurate scientific knowledge upon which early years environmental teaching may build. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Science graduates who enrol in a preservice Graduate Diploma of Education bring with them many years of experience as learners of science. These will have enabled them to develop implicit theories about what a science teacher is and does. Such implicit theories almost certainly affect the process of becoming a teacher, and may prove persistent despite the input from University and school during the Dip. Ed. year and beyond. This paper presents the research method and results obtained from a group of graduates on entry to their Diploma course. Concept maps and Repertory Grid interviews were obtained from eleven graduates, with varying life experiences.

AB  - Concept mapping and vee diagramming are metalearning tools that have recently appeared on the science education scene. Literature attesting to their metacognitive potentials for students provide reason for optimism regarding their use for tackling rote memorization of scientific concepts. Are teachers who are key agents in the diffusion process of an educational innovation positively disposed towards these new metalearning tools? This is the broad question addressed in this study. The first phase of the study resulted in the development and validation of an instrument - the Attitude towards Concept- and Vee-Mapping Inventory (ACVMI). The second phase involved the use of this instrument to collect data for answering two major research questions. Data obtained from 48 biology, 36 chemistry, 24 physics and 33 mathematics teachers who had been trained in and had used the two tools showed a largely favourable attitude towards learning the techniques and using them in teaching science rather than mathematics. Both science and mathematics teachers expressed views favouring both metalearning tools in terms of their benefits in the areas of meaningful learning and reduction of anxiety levels. A few questions were tackled in the study and some more questions surfaced. One of these is the observed poor attitude of mathematics teachers towards vee mapping. The other is how to assist teachers in teaching both concept mapping and vee mapping such that they can gain greater confidence, especially with teaching vee mapping in science and mathematics classrooms. Research focused on these and related questions is eagerly awaited. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Problem solving is an enduring issue in science education, ostensibly because science in itself, is basically concerned with problem solving—exploring the universe and seeking answers to intriguing phenomena in nature. Remarkable strides have been made in psychology about recording the minutiae of problem solving as a cognitive process. Concept mapping, a meta-learning tool, is appearing on the scene as a potential pathway for promoting the acquisition of problem-solving skills. Drawing 40 subjects from a pool of students who experienced cooperative and individualistic concept-mapping experiences for six months and adjudged to be good concept mappers, this study found the concept-mapping group to be significantly more successful in solving three biological problems than 20 subjects who served as control. Written and think-aloud procedures and interviews were conducted as part of the administration of the Biology Problem Solving Test. No statistically significant difference was found between students who mapped concepts cooperatively and those who mapped individually. There were mixed results for gender. The implications of the findings for further research and for improving problem-solving abilities of students are drawn. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if a concept map used as an advance organizer can improve the science achievement of eighth‐grade students. Eighty‐two eighth‐grade students in four science classes participated in this study. The experimental group completed the concept map at the beginning of the science unit under the teacher's supervision. At the end of the two‐week unit a science test was administered to the experimental and the control group. The results of a one‐tailed t test indicated that there was a significant difference between the two groups. The effect size is 0.40. It appears that the concept map can provide the classroom teachers with a meaningful and practical structured approach for using advance organizers in their classes.

Their implications for improving social studies education are drawn, in particular identifying key ideas, using graphic concept maps in instruction, and assessing students' prior knowledge and its connections. A conceptualization of differences between children of different ages according to the characteristics of their cognitive structures and processes is suggested. Anticipated difficulties with the approach as a whole are also outlined. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Science educators working with prospective elementary teachers strive to facilitate an understanding of science as well as an understanding of student and teacher roles in learning science in the classroom. One goal should be the introduction of strategies which assist prospective teachers in learning independently. Concept mapping provides a useful learning tool in assisting students' critical reading of assigned materials. In this study, each student constructed his or her own map which facilitated group discussions and provided further opportunity to reflect on the ideas being presented. The purpose of reading became making connections instead of absorbing information. Through the process students gained a better understanding of a way of thinking about science which provides a valuable foundation for facilitating continued learning. © 1990 The Association for the Education of Teachers in Science (AETS).

AB  - Studies have shown that physical science students' understanding of concepts, and relations between concepts, is often less than would be expected from the assessment results they achieve. Explanations for the difference include the widespread use in examinations of ‘problems' which, given sufficient rehearsal, become little more than exercises. Many of these examinations containing exercises are also thought to encourage surface approaches to learning, leading to lower quality learning outcomes. In this study we compare students' performances in an alternative assessment method — creativity exercises — with their results in concept mapping and traditional examination exercises. Student performance in all three methods was found to correlate positively with a deep study strategy, while low correlations between the three methods suggest that they may test three different aspects of chemistry knowledge. If used together these methods may encourage a deeper approach to learning, contribute to a greater understanding of the subject and be more beneficial in helping students improve their learning and problem solving abilities. © 1990, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article outlines the use of concept maps as a tool for science curriculum development and discusses the changes that occur in the teacher's view of the curriculum with successive revisions of the maps. Although we have used concept mapping in curriculum development with teachers from grades 4–8, we describe in detail the maps created by sixth‐grade teachers. We analyzed the maps using three criteria: hierarchical structure, progressive differentiation, and integrative reconciliation. Changes made to the maps during the revision process, including additions and deletions, show increased clarification of both the concepts to be learned and the connections between them. Consecutive map revisions show the development of a cohesive conceptual grade‐six science curriculum. The use of concept maps can help science teachers develop science curriculum that is hierarchically arranged, integrated, and conceptually driven.

AB  - The results of recent studies into the use of the concept mapping heuristic seem to demonstrate that meaningful learning results through its use in science classrooms. While this underscores the need to use more effective instructional strategies in science teaching, the issue of the intervening variable of anxiety in learning and science achievement, and the possible use of a metacognitive strategy in anxiety reduction have not been addressed. This study, therefore, sought to find out if the metacognitive strategy of concept mapping reduces anxiety and thereby enhances achievement in biology. A total of 51 (30 boys, 21 girls) senior secondary one (grade 10) students participated in this experiment. Two instruments—the Zuckerman Affect Adjective Checklist and the Biology Achievement Test—were used in pre‐ and posttest administrations to measure the treatment effect on anxiety and achievement, respectively. Findings support the stand that concept mapping is significantly more effective than the traditional/expository teaching strategy in enhancing learning in biology. In addition, it apparently reduces students' anxiety towards the learning of biology. A significant reduction of anxiety was noticed for male subjects.

AB  - This study examined the concurrent validity of concept maps as vehicles for documenting and exploring conceptual change in biology. Students (N = 91) who enrolled in an elementary science methods course were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Subjects in both groups were administered a multiple‐choice/free‐response inventory which assayed their knowledge of “Life Zones in the Ocean,” and then were asked to construct a concept map on the same topic. Those in the experimental group subsequently received 45 minutes of computer‐assisted instruction on marine life zones, while those in the control (“placebo”) group received an equivalent exposure to an unrelated topic (“Body Defenses”). Upon completing the instructional sequence, subjects were again administered the “Life Zones” inventory and asked to develop a postinstruction concept map on marine life zones. The data analysis employed a split plot factorial design with repeated measures. Differences among treatment groups were documented by analysis of variance and chi‐square procedures. Subjects in the experimental group showed evidence of significant and substantial changes in the complexity and prepositional structure of the knowledge base, as revealed in concept maps. No such changes were found in the control group. Results suggest that concept mapping offers a valid and potentially useful technique for documenting and exploring conceptual change in biology.

The metaphor of the map and its applicability for representing scientific knowledge are discussed. The context of concept mapping is presented and suggestions for successful application of the technique in the science classroom are offered. Finally, researchers are invited to conduct studies that investigate the graphic representation of scientific knowledge in order to create, evaluate, and improve the graphics and graphic metacognitive tools (such as concept mapping) which are used in science teaching.

AB  - Both chemistry teachers and nonmajor students appear to agree that freshman chemistry may well be the most problematic traditional science discipline taught in the first year of college—as far as students' misunderstandings, learning difficulties, and misconceptions are concerned. The above is probably due to the many abstract, nonintuitive concepts, which are not directly interrelated. Consequently, in such cases, the powerful, general teaching strategy of “concept mapping” must be replaced by alternative, specific strategies. Selected illustrative examples of students' learning difficulties and misconceptions in freshman general and organic chemistry are presented in the students' terms, followed by the corresponding successfully applied, specific, concept‐oriented, eclectic intervention strategies the author uses in order to overcome the difficulties. Based on longitudinal in‐class observations, interpretive study, and analysis it is suggested that those students' misconceptions in freshman chemistry which are not interrelated logically and/or derived from one another are not prone to the general “concept mapping” approach and should be dealt with by using the appropriate, specific teaching strategy.

AB  - The search for more effective, alternative instructional strategies has led to focusing attention on the metacognitive strategy of concept mapping. The heuristic of concept mapping assists learners in understanding concepts and relationships between them and seeing the hierarchical conceptual propositional nature of knowledge. While the search for the enhancement of meaningful learning through metacognition is being intensified, there is a need to relate it to other classroom climate variables that could hamper the total classroom functioning of a student in the learning of science. This study investigated the relationship between the concept mapping heuristic and anxiety‐a variable that has been found to have a militating effect on learning. A total of 51 senior secondary school students formed the sample of the study. Using a pre‐post‐test experimental design, the experimental subjects had a 6‐week treatment of learning selected science concepts through the concept mapping strategy. Analysis of the data collected showed the instructional strategy involving concept mapping to be effective and to lead to a significant lowering in students’ anxiety towards the study of science. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This paper describes the group cognitive structure of 60 first year preservice nursing students, with respect to 21 basic chemistry concepts. Group cognitive structure is represented by non-metric multidimensional scaling of data obtained from individual concept maps prepared by students.

AB  - The directed‐inquiry approach to learning science process skills and scientific problem solving [DIAL(SPS)2] was developed to help high‐school students gain the critical thinking skills required to solve problems in the biology lab. This curriculum integrated several learning strategies into a single approach: advance organizers, the learning cycle, concept maps, Vee diagrams, a focusing strategy, and writing. Two general questions were addressed. First, was the DIAL(SPS)2 treatment more effective than a conventional treatment? Second, was there evidence of an aptitude‐treatment interaction? Four high‐school biology classes taught by this investigator were used to test the DIAL(SPS)2 curriculum. Scheduling of students involved ability grouping. To test the curriculum in the most rigorous way, the experimental group consisted of average ability students and the comparison group consisted of above‐average students. Both the groups were pretested in August and posttested in May. In the intervening time, the experimental group received the DIAL(SPS)2 treatment while the comparison group received a more traditional approach. Analysis of covariance revealed that the DIAL(SPS)2 curriculum had no significant effect on the learning of science process skills or on cognitive development. Aptitude‐treatment interaction analyses revealed an interaction of DIAL(SPS)2 treatment and cognitive development. Copyright © 1989 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - The growth of the literature on topic difficulties within the last two decades has indexed an increase in students' aversion towards key concepts in the sciences. This study explored the possibility that the concept-mapping strategy could be a fruitful way of reducing the anxiety levels of students as well as helping to change their attitudes towards concepts that are traditionally perceived to be difficult. Data collected from 138 pre-degree biology students on two areas of biology—ecology and genetics—that are perceived to be highly difficult show that (1) those students who were exposed to the concept-mapping strategy (experimental group; N = 63) had a significantly lower level of anxiety than the control (N=75) in ecology and genetics; (2) after treatment, the experimental group students perceived ecology to be less difficult. They also recorded a significantly lower mean score in their perception of the difficulty of genetics when compared with the control. Overall, the results showed that students' perception of the difficulty of and anxiety toward ecology and genetics—traditionally dreaded areas of biology, changed for the better as a result of engagement in concept mapping. The implications of these results for instruction and for further research are drawn. © 1989, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - The problem-solving process used by scientists and by clinicians is compared and contrasted. The most creative step for both groups is the ability to make an association between some external stimulus or situation and concepts stored in memory. Medical education must put more emphasis on teaching that improves students’ abilities to make these associations. Two teaching methods that can promote development of the necessary association skills in clinical contexts—“wait time” and “concept mapping”—are briefly reviewed. Concept mapping consists of connecting words that represent concepts with lines that represent relationships and then labeling the lines. Wait time is waiting three to five seconds between asking a group of students a question and calling on a student to answer or waiting three to five seconds before responding to the student’s answer. © 1988 Association of American Medical Colleges.

AB  - The aim of this study was to describe science teachers' knowledge of specific biology and physics topics and trace the effects of this knowledge on their planning for instruction and on simulated teaching. Six experienced secondary-school teachers - three specializing in physics and three in biology - participated in the study. Each teacher's knowledge of a biology topic and a physics topic was assessed using summary free recall, concept-map line labeling, and sorting tasks. A small number of schemata described each teacher's subject-matter knowledge. The teachers planned instruction in the biology and physics topics based on content in textbook chapters provided by the investigator. The planning took place in thinking-aloud sessions. The influence of the teachers' prior subject-matter knowledge was evident in their modifications of textbook subject-matter content and through their use of explanatory representations. Simulated teaching consisted of a critical-incidents technique. The effects of subject-matter knowledge were apparent here through the teachers' use of evaluative structures and responses to critical incidents. © 1987.

AB  - In conclusion the results indicate that, in the early grades of the secondary school, the wide range of terms introduced into the teaching of science not only to maintain the precision of the discipline, but also to arouse the interest of pupils, need not be too limited. Satiation of the pupils' abilities to assimilate the concepts and to manipulate them in thinking can be overcome by presentation with explanations. Further, an inference can be drawn from the evidence that the introduction of explained concepts increases the learning of pupils. The results have been applied in the training of a limited sample of beginning science teachers. After viewing demonstration tapes and discussing results the trainees exhibited increased interest and willingness to spend time in analysing their language and to use concept-mapping as pre-lesson aids to improvement. © 1981 Australian Science Education Research Association.

AB  - The procedures devised for mapping and evaluating maps has been applied to a number of different topic areas both for senior chemistry and for junior science. We believe that this procedure for constructing concept maps is more comprehensive and facilitates student use better than previous procedures. The procedure for evaluating concept maps has also been refined to the point whereby the classroom teacher can readily apply it as part of his/her teaching strategy. The research for this paper further supports concept mapping both as an instructional and evaluative tool. © 1981 Australian Science Education Research Association.

AB  - The physiological and chemical properties of haemoglobin have been investigated for some seventy years, culminating in the atomic model proposed by M. F. Perutz in 1968. The present paper uses the model and the description of the oxygenation mechanism proposed by Perutz in 1970 as a teaching principle to illustrate the relationship between structure and function at the molecular level for undergraduate and HNC students. The evidence used to explain the properties of normal and abnormal haemoglobin molecules is summarised. Some suggestions are made for practical exercises to illustrate the topic, arising out of the author's experience of teaching medical laboratory science to HNC students. A sequential presentation of the properties of haemoglobin is given in the form of a concept map and an attempt is made to arrange these concepts into a hierarchy after the manner of R. M. Gagne. This leads to a consideration of pre-requisite knowledge in biochemistry and raises the problem of what is relevant for the understanding of advanced concepts by medical and para-medical students. Some evidence pertaining to the use of D. P. Ausubel's “advance organisers” is summarised and some suggestions offered as to how their value could be investigated in the present context. Finally, H. T. Epstein's research paper method of teaching is considered. In this, it is claimed that learning is facilitated by reading and discussing a series of research papers on a topic and by predicting, in advance, what investigations would be necessary to solve the problem. The present author lists a series of papers which could be used for testing this mode of teaching. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.
