One afternoon this summer, I found myself running in the rain.
It started soon after I did and I was thoroughly soaked before turning around.
I like running because it gives me time to reflect, but running in the rain is not a particular pleasant experience.
And so I reflected, how did I end up out here with soggy shoes, barely able to see through spotty glasses?
The short answer is because I didn't plan to. 

## Self-Help or Self-Sabotage?
I have enjoyed a fair amount of self-help books and podcasts, such as the OG *Seven Habits* by Steven Covey.
I think that many people have good things to say about time management, self-leadership, etc.
One of the most helpful things I have taken away from these resources is the importance of reflection and intentionality.
At some point, one needs to choose goals, order their activities towards achieving them, and assess their progress.

However, this can easily be taken too far and result in a never-ending cycle of goal-setting and planning.
These meta activities which were once meant to support the achievement of goals actually parasitize the time and energy required to make progress. 
At worst this can become self-reinforcing when a lack of progress motivates more assessment, reflection, goal-setting, and planning.
Thus, planning becomes the end in-and-of itself and self-help becomes self-sabotage.

## Making Progress
I fell into this self-sabotage trap during my PhD program.
I spent many hours creating spreadsheets to help me plan and assess progress towards goals.
I even learned about Gantt charts and tried to make them in R (spoilers: you can, but why?).
Only when deadlines started carrying consequences did I prioritize progress and finish the bulk of my dissertation work in about six months.

My final dissertation project was the biggest piece and consisted of a large meta-analysis.
In a couple months I screened nearly 5000 abstracts and 500 documents, then coded several dozen variables for 150 of those documents.
If you have done a meta-analysis then you would know that a meta-analysis with 150 documents (and 450 effect sizes) often takes teams of researchers and students the same or longer amount of time to complete.
The only reason why I was able to work long hours efficiently for so long is because the progress I was making was obvious.
The progress was itself motivating and spurred me on.

At this point, you might say that I benefitted from a great deal of planning that I did do through the course of my program.
And yes, it is true that I learned a lot, that I had practiced my skills for years, and that I was able to convert these into a sound project plan.
Nevertheless, this planning was not some version of personal management or leadership.
I did not budget time, journal my reflections, set internal or intermediate goals, gamify common tasks, or otherwise tinker with my behavior.
These things would have stalled my progress and killed my motivation.
I did know that I had a sound plan and that I was making progress.
Thus, it was relatively easy to get up early and work.

## When Progress is Not Apparent
Unfortunately, it is not always clear when progress is being made.
This was certainly true for me in the first few years of my PhD when I did not know what I would do for my dissertation.
In these cases, it seems to me that the best thing to do is to develop small, clearly-defined tasks that contribute towards larger goals.
For me, some examples of such tasks include browsing the lastest journal issues or writing a blog post like this one.[^2]
Progress can then be defined as completing these tasks on some periodic basis.

[^2]: For me, blogging is a way to exercise my writing skills and to pay back the many blog posts that I have found helpful or interesting.

For example, when I was learning and developing a plan for my disseration, I should have defined progress as reading x papers a week with light notes.
Instead of two years or so of haphazard work defined by anxious uncertainty, I would have quickly developed my interests *and* my capacity to pursue them.
As a general rule, I don't have regrets[^3] but one of the few I do have is not using this time more effectively.

[^3]: Regrets don't make sense to me.
We are the people we are because of what we have done and experienced.
If I had the ability to act on my regrets, changing my past accordingly, then I wouldn't be the person I am today to regret it.
The better question to me is what can I learn, how can I change in light of what I know now?

## Running
Completing a marathon is an aspiration of mine.
I do not know when I will, but I would like to in the next few years.
I also aspire to live a long, productive life and to be as fit as my Grampa who could outwalk his grandkids in his 80s.
I could plan and track progress towards completing a marathon, but I cannot plan and tinker my way into health.
Yes, I know, it is important to develop a good lifestyle based on habits conducive to health.
But, speaking from personal experience, it is difficult to develop an exercise habit when you are not fit to begin with.

I ran in the rain that summer day because I didn't plan to.
I had developed the habit of going for a run when I had a free hour in the afternoon.
I did not have a plan on which days I would run or at what time.
Neither did I complicate my running with gear (just running shoes and earbuds) or routes (just a convenient loop) or target times (just go).
These things are not bad and might be really helpful in reaching specific goals.
But they can get in the way of making progress.
