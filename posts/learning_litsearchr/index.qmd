Search strategy development is a crucial step in evidence synthesis. 
Well-formed strategies may capture previously unknown facets of the literature or reduce the number of irrelevant search results.

The number of irrelevant records (precision) is generally less important than the proportion of relevant records retrieved (recall).
It is unlikely that all relevant records can ever be retrieved but the search strategy could return a biased sample, which may influence the conclusions of the meta-study.
This is especially true when using machine learning-assisted screening tools (e.g., "abstrackr") <!--# add a hyperlink here --> which reduces the burden of title/abstract screening.
As such, the goal of search strategy development in a systematic review or meta-analysis is to maximize recall.

Reporting guidelines have recognized the importance of the search strategy for the quality and transparency of systematic reviews <!--# add a link or citation -->.
Recommendations for search strategy development have emphasized the importance of content knowledge and facility with database interfaces (such as Scopus, Web of Science, or EBSCOHost ERIC).
This introduces a lot of judgement calls based on prior knowledge of the literature and numerous search string tests (the results of which are rarely saved).
Expert judgement is an important part of any scholarly work but documentation...

`litsearchr` enables quick evaluations of search results via text-mining and keyword co-occurrence networks <!--# citation-->. 
Thus preliminary searches can be used to discover important terms to add to the search string.
As this is done in R, all results can be easily documented along with significant decisions in search strategy development.
In this demonstration, I show the use of `litsearchr` in developing a search strategy for a systematic review in science education.
