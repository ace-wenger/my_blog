AB  - Critical thinking, a rational and open higher-order thinking mode in human cognition, is becoming imperative to success in modern life. Therefore, cultivating students' critical thinking has become a common goal of education reform worldwide. Teachers play a crucial role in cultivating students' critical thinking. However, existing studies have paid little attention to teachers, especially middle school teachers' knowledge and understanding of critical thinking. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the perspectives of ten Chinese middle school chemistry teachers on critical thinking using concept maps, thinking aloud, and in-depth interviews based on concept maps. Results showed that most of the teachers believed that critical thinking means reflection and questioning and requires evidence awareness. All teachers had a positive attitude towards critical thinking and believed that it can promote evidence awareness, problem solving, decision making, teaching evaluation, logic, and systematisation. Teachers recognised that critical thinking can be taught, and the major factors affecting the development of students' critical thinking were the environment, students themselves, teachers, evaluation, subject characteristics, and types of knowledge. Several strategies for developing students' critical thinking in chemistry teaching were proposed, including setting diversified and different types of chemistry courses, developing controversial curriculum themes in real situations, and implementing experimental, project-based, problem solving, and history-based teaching. In addition, this study showed that teachers and students promoted the development of critical thinking within one another. Further, this study demonstrated an effective methodology for probing individual subjective thoughts.

AB  - Concept mapping remains widely used in education. However, little is known about how self-constructed concept maps and peer feedback can improve student learning outcomes in chemistry. We investigated the effects of peer feedback on concept mapping and how it improves students' learning performance in a large second-semester, introductory chemistry course. Three hundred and twenty students were randomly assigned to one of two concept mapping conditions: self-constructed concept map with peer feedback and self-constructed concept map without peer feedback. Each group constructed concept maps that depicted the relationship between concepts on the topic of intermolecular force. The results showed that students in the self-constructed concept map with peer feedback condition outperformed students in the no peer feedback condition in chemistry learning outcome. Overall, this study demonstrates that peer feedback enhances the effectiveness of learning with generative concept maps. The implications and future directions are discussed.

AB  - Concept maps have been verified as an effective learning tool in technology-supported learning environments, in particular, in K-12 education. To enable educational technology researchers and school teachers to thoroughly know the research foci and applications of concept maps in technology-supported learning environments for K-12 education (CM-K12), the present study conducted a systematic review of studies published in seven SSCI (Social Science Citation Index) journals of educational technology by referring to the technology-based learning model. The review results showed that concept maps mostly played the role of a personal Mindtool and a collaborative Mindtool, and were mainly applied in elementary schools. The majority of elementary school teachers employed concept maps as a collaborative Mindtool (for a learning group), a personal Mindtool (for individual students), and a learning design tool. As for secondary school teachers, concept maps were mostly adopted as an assessment and evaluation tool, personal Mindtools, and collaborative Mindtools. In terms of application issues, the most adopted medium was desk-top computers, and the most adopted application domains were science, engineering, and language. The research focus explored the most in CM-K12 research was cognition, followed by affect and learning behavior. Based on the findings, several recommendations are proposed.

AB  - Studies have shown that students learning to write in engineering fields struggle to integrate subject matter and communication expertise, and that STEM faculty's communication knowledge often remains tacit, rather than being explicitly taught to students. Here we show a method for eliciting and revealing tacit communication knowledge using what we call disciplinary reasoning diagrams. We offer diagrams we have developed for Materials Science and Engineering, Brain and Cognitive Science, proof-based Mathematics, and Computer Systems, and explain how they function as instructional tools that can help students integrate knowledge domains from STEM and from writing, and to scaffold their ability to think critically and communicate effectively in their field.

AB  - As a representative catabolic reaction that widely exists in nature, anaerobic digestion (AD) exhibits great value regarding the global carbon cycle, renewable energy development, and environmental protection. Such an important biochemical reaction was ignored before and should be introduced into the teaching and textbooks of undergraduate biochemistry courses. However, students may face obstructions when learning AD theories since the metabolic pathways in AD are very complex. To solve these problems, an instructive metabolic minimap of the AD reaction was designed, including its reaction stages, reaction pathways, substrates, and enzymes. Furthermore, the interrelationships between aerobic catabolism (AEC) and anaerobic catabolism (ANC) were also summarized by combining the catabolic pathways of typical biological macromolecules. In this paper, AD theories were first replenished into undergraduate biochemistry courses by metabolic minimap, which not only provided valuable supports for the practical teaching of AD in undergraduate biochemistry courses, but also acted as an important reference for students in biology-related majors and biochemistry teachers.

AB  - The properties and functions of complex systems apply across a variety of domains of science and are at the heart of the solutions to many global crises facing the world today. As such, understanding of complex systems has been increasingly recognized as a core goal of science education. Learning about complexity-related concepts and phenomena is persistently considered difficult for many students--even at the undergraduate level, but traditional pedagogical approaches have been unsuccessful in teaching complex systems effectively. Evidence indicates that agent-based participatory simulations can be promising for this purpose. Using mixed methods, cross-case analysis, we examined how undergraduates experience changes in their understanding of the watershed as a complex ecosystem with the use of a particular agent-based participatory simulation called the UVA Bay Game. While one of the cases yielded evidence of nonsignificant quantitative change between pre- and post-simulation concept maps, this study observed an overall positive increase of complex system understanding through both concept map analysis and narrative reflections on learning. Our findings extend the current understanding of the role of participatory agent-based simulations in teaching and learning about complex systems in classrooms. Implications and limitations are discussed.

AB  - Mind mapping refers to the use of a specific graphic organizer to support learning. This paper describes the effect of mind mapping on pre-schoolers' geometric learning. Using a pre- and posttest control group quasi-experimental model, researchers found that the use of mind maps resulted in a statistically significant difference in geometry learning for pre-schoolers (mean age = 65.0 months). These results are discussed in terms of their ramifications for pre-school geometry education, as well as for the use of mind maps with pre-school children.

AB  - This study explores whether learning approaches combining augmented reality and multidimensional concept maps (ARMCMs) would improve learning effectiveness, learning motivation, learning satisfaction, and cognitive load more than multidimensional concept maps (MCMs) and augmented reality (AR) learning do. The study employed a quasi-experimental design, and the subjects were 93 students from an elementary school in Taiwan. By dividing the students into ARMCMs group, MCMs group, and AR group, the results show that the learning with ARMCMs can provide better promotion on learning motivation and positive influences on learning effectiveness, learning satisfaction, and cognitive load.

AB  - Concept map (CM) is introduced as a useful tool for studying students' system thinking (ST). However, it is more known to represent students' knowledge of system components and organization and less recognized as a tool to examine and enhance students' understanding about the underlying causal mechanisms in complex systems. In this study, through a mixed method approach, we investigated the potential of CM in demonstrating undergraduate students' (n = 173) ST. We also conducted a comparative analysis to examine the effects of different scaffolding on developing students' ST skills. Through a theoretical framework of causal patterns, we present a new perspective on what CM reveals about students' ST and what are its limitations in showing system complexities. The results indicated that CM can provide a platform for students to practice causal mechanisms such as domino, mutual, relational, and cyclic causalities, and accordingly, work as a tool for teachers to examine students' knowledge of such mechanisms. The results also showed that students improved in demonstrating ST by CM when they were scaffolded for showing causal mechanisms and building CM. Eventually, this study concludes that the CM is a highly relevant tool to increase and examine students' ST skills. To this end, we found it is important to explicitly teach students about causal patterns and guide them to construct CM with an emphasis on showing the interconnection among concepts.

AB  - This study is about the effectiveness of concept maps as a formative assessment. It aimed to investigate the effectiveness of concept maps in formative assessment for the teaching and learning of biological concepts at the secondary level. One group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design was used for this study. The experiment was completed in six weeks. A sample of 46 students was selected from Karimabad District Hunza. Data were collected by conducting a Bioenergetics Diagnostic Test at each interval with and without intervention. It was found that concept maps are useful for the development of a clear understanding of concepts in Biology. Concept maps refrain from rote learning thus promoting critical thinking and reasoning ability and act as an effective classroom instructional and a formative assessment tool. It was concluded that the concept maps can be used as an effective formative assessment tool in Biology at the secondary level.

AB  - It is important to be able to make better informed decisions about issues such as sustainability and climate change that have both personal and global impact as early as possible in life. Primary teachers have a significant role in supporting students' learning and understanding of these concepts. One important teaching skill that needs to be improved for understand sustainable development is the creation of meaningful generalizations, including models. Therefore, the learning experiences of pre-service primary teachers (N = 28) in regard to modelling was our focus. The results of our case study indicated concrete and visual modes as most common in student teachers' experiences and understandings of modelling. The symbolic mode is less in evidence and an understanding of gestural and verbal models is rather unambiguous. Thus, we see a need and the potential to improve teaching and learning experiences in teacher education about the modelling of complex concepts.

AB  - Scholars and researchers generally believe that scientific inquiry is an important activity for cultivating students' applied knowledge and high-level thinking ability. The process of scientific inquiry can promote students' learning motivation and trigger their higher-order thinking ability. However, students may not have enough prior knowledge or they may lack inquiry experience, which may influence the effectiveness of their inquiry learning. Besides, in a scientific inquiry environment assisted by technology, students must face abundant and diverse learning resources, and may not effectively organize and carry out advanced cogitation to solve problems. Therefore, this research proposed an integrated concept mapping and image recognition (IR) approach to help students effectively acquire and organize knowledge in the process of scientific inquiry. This study applied a quasi-experimental design to verify the effect of this proposed approach. The experimental group conducted the concept mapping-based IR (CM-IR) learning approach, whilst the control group conducted the conventional IR-based learning approach to evaluate the students' performance in terms of their learning motivation and learning achievements. The participants were two classes of 10th-grade students in northern Taiwan. One was the experimental group with 22 students, whilst the other was the control group with 22 students. The experimental results show that the students learning with the CM-IR learning approach had better learning achievement, attitudes and intrinsic motivation, as well as higher mental load than those learning with the conventional IR-based learning approach. Accordingly, several suggestions are provided for future research in this field.

AB  - Humor is considered an educational method that can be implemented in educational processes with a wide range of educational variables. Examining the scope of research on educational humor has the potential to guide future studies. Therefore, the aim of this study is to show the conceptual trend in humor research in education over the past decade. 989 publications on the subject of humor in education were analyzed using the text mining method. A text analytic tool was used for the analysis, and the titles, abstracts, and keywords were included in the text analytics. As a result of the study, humor was studied in terms of various variables in different educational fields. In addition, the reflections of humor in education base on technological developments and the target groups applied were also revealed. The findings revealed the conceptual relationships and concept maps by year. It was concluded that the concept of humor in educational research is particularly related to the variables of motivation, attention, skill, creativity, engagement, and interest. Upon comparing 2010 and 2019, it has been observed that concepts related to online education, science, collaborative learning, and technology in humor studies have spread in recent years. In addition, humor has also emerged as a research phenomenon in language, health, and science education.

AB  - Giving feedback to peers can be a valuable learning experience for a feedback provider. However, different types of products require different types of feedback, which, in turn, may lead to different learning outcomes. The current study investigates the effect on the learning of feedback providers of reviewing different types of products. Secondary school students (n =127) were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions: giving peer feedback on either concept maps or answers to open-ended test questions. Both types of product, created by the researchers, were comparable with regard to content: they included the same misconceptions and were both of average quality. Giving peer feedback was part of a chemistry lesson delivered in an online inquiry learning environment. Students' post-test scores, their own learning products, and the quality of the provided feedback were analysed to check for an effect on learning. There was no difference in post-test scores between the conditions, but the quality of the provided feedback predicted post-test scores. This indicates that it is not the type of product reviewed that matters, but the effort that students put into giving feedback. Possible implications for practice and further research directions are discussed.

AB  - This study explores teachers' conceptions of STEM education at the beginning of an online graduate course for practicing PK-12 teachers (n=20). A grounded theory approach was used to analyze open-ended survey data and concept maps. Teachers in the study interpreted STEM teaching from either a disciplinary or an integrated perspective. Their conceptions of STEM education within their concept maps fell into one or more of six categories: (1) utilitarian; (2) acquisition of disciplinary knowledge; (3) activities and resources; (4) access to meaningful problem-solving experiences; (5) advocacy for systemic change; and (6) buzzwords. This study reveals the complexity of teachers' conceptions of STEM education as they prepare to integrate STEM in their classrooms. The use of concept maps as a formative assessment can better position teacher educators and professional developers to move teachers toward a more sustainable integrated perspective of STEM teaching.

AB  - Science is a human endeavor; the way it is taught, applied, and in some cases exclude populations from having access to it, may affect people for generations (NGSS Lead States 2013). Science education continues to be a complex civil rights issue (Tate 2001), but there is hope. Movements to promote just, equitable, and inclusive opportunities to learn within the context of community, identity, and action are being developed and implemented in classrooms across the country. This article describes lessons planned with a lens on gender equity, community needs, and engineering for a diverse population. It sits within a larger framework of physics knowledge for social justice and community applications. Before beginning a modeling, design, and construction project, students at an urban high school in southern California considered the implications of who participates on the design team for a science project. The following questions framed the exploration: (1) How does the perspective of the design team affect the product outcome?; (2) Who should be selected for a design team?; and (3) How to communicate the need for a diverse design team to the larger community? The focus of this article is on the ways in which the authors helped their diverse population of students feel capable and welcome, and to understand why they belong in physics when traditionally there have been so few physicists to whom they can relate.

AB  - Curriculum mapping is the process of creating a visual representation of the teaching and assessment of learning outcomes in a degree, program or major. Best practice recommendations about curriculum mapping typically focus on mapping individual programs. Therefore, many recommendations, such as meeting individually with faculty as they map their course, may not be feasible for large-scale mapping projects. This paper describes the process of a large-scale curriculum mapping project designed to map the Bachelor of Science degree and 24 of its associated majors. The project involved the participation of faculty from three colleges within a research-intensive University to map over 400 courses. We describe the key questions and decisions involved in carrying out the mapping project, our data collection and analysis process, and our dissemination efforts to ensure that the mapping results were used to inform curricular change.

AB  - This research study investigated conceptions about buoyancy held by 55 elementary preservice teachers enrolled in a science methods course who participated in an instructional intervention designed to increase their knowledge about buoyancy. Pre- and post-concept maps were analyzed using a paired sample t test and thematic analysis was used to interpret narratives, drawings, and interview data. There was a statistically significant difference (t = -3.504, p = 0.001) in the total number of scientifically correct concepts for the pre-concept maps (M = 0.51, SD = 0.879) and post-concept maps (M = 1.25, SD = 1.542). The total number of accurate propositions increased between the pre- and post-concept maps. The drawings revealed that most participants (66%) had alternative conceptions about how gravity is related to buoyancy and the role it plays in floating and sinking. Data from the interviews triangulated with other data sources that showed gains in scientific conceptions such as opposing forces (53%) and surface area (33%), while documenting the persistence of serious alternative conceptions about floating and sinking (49%), the key role of fluid density (56%), and density of an object (62%).

AB  - Online learning has been widely discussed in education research, and open educational resources have become an increasingly popular way to help learners acquire knowledge. However, these resources contain massive amounts of information, making it difficult for learners to identify Web articles that refer to computer science knowledge. This study developed an Internet articles retrieval agent combined with dynamic associative concept maps (DACMs). The system used text mining technology to analyze keywords to filter computer science articles. In previous research, concept maps were manually constructed; in this study, such maps can be automatically and dynamically generated in real time. In a case study of a fundamental course of artificial intelligence, this study designed two experiments to compare students' learning behaviors while using this system and the Google search engine. The results of the first experiment showed that the experimental group searched for more knowledge articles on computer science using this agent, compared to the control group using the Google search engine. The learning performance of the experimental group was significantly better than that of the control group, while the cognitive load of the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group. Furthermore, the results of the second experiment showed that the learning progress of students using the agent was significantly greater than that of students who used the Google search engine. This illustrates that the agent effectively filtered computer science articles, and DACMs helped students gain a deeper understanding of academic concepts and knowledge related to artificial intelligence.

AB  - This research used Novakian concept mapping and interview techniques to track changes in knowledge and understanding amongst students and their supervisors in the course of full-time research towards a laboratory science-based PhD. This detailed longitudinal case study analysis measures both cognitive change in the specific subjects that are the topic for research, and the understanding of the process of PhD level research and supervision. The data show the challenges for students and supervisors from different national, ethnic, cultural, and academic backgrounds and traditions with a focus on how this impacts the PhD research process and development. Working cross-culturally, and often in a setting different from either the student or the supervisor's background and training, can lead to a lack of common language and understanding for the development of a pedagogically oriented supervisory relationship. Documenting change in knowledge and understanding among PhD students and their supervisors is key to surfacing what the joint processes of mutual democratic research and of supervision may entail. This study explores how one of these key processes is a student's developing sense of belonging (or non-belonging). Specifically, this paper engages the concepts of belonging, and democratic education through mutual learning, to explore the practices of working across national, cultural, ethnic, and diverse academic backgrounds, for both supervisors and students. Doctoral study is understood as a situated context in which belonging also acts as a gateway for who can join the global scientific community.

AB  - This paper explores enabling conditions for scaling high-quality project-based learning (PBL) to understand factors that influence how PBL spreads, whether and how it can be sustained and the extent to which it informs meaningful change in schools. We report on a year-long collaboration across three research projects. Each project team analyzed qualitative data from their individual project and then aggregated data across projects to understand similarities and variations in conditions that support the long-term implementation goals of PBL. We used systems mapping as a methodological tool and a case study approach to test and refine the map. We focus on two enabling conditions for PBL that emerged across all contexts: teacher agency and productive disciplinary engagement (PDE). Teachers reported having agency and described making instructional decisions and adapting PBL to support students' needs. PDE motivated teachers to deepen PBL practices. While the studied collaboratory is not the first to pursue shared goals, to our knowledge it is the first to produce research that aggregates knowledge and data across projects. While scaling innovations in schools is complex, the results suggest that certain conditions enable PBL to be implemented with greater depth and can be generalized across contexts. We discuss the implications of this approach for researchers, stakeholders, and practitioners.

AB  - Concept maps are powerful tools used to reveal challenges in students' learning. However, their use introduces complexities when a large group of students' conceptualizations need to be examined. In this study, concept maps of 344 general chemistry students were analyzed after grouping them based on achievement in chemistry, math proficiency, and gender. The analysis was also expanded with the consideration of eccentricity values and the extended chemistry triplet. Although some similarities exist between the map of high-achieving students in chemistry and that of high-performing students in the Mathematics Placement Test (MPT), the calculated eccentricity values show interesting variations. On the other hand, the analysis of the map of the low-performing students in MPT and that of low-achieving students in chemistry revealed no clear patterns of symbolic, macroscopic, and submicroscopic terms. Practical suggestions were included to increase the use of representative maps in different assessment and teaching scenarios.

AB  - The performance in biology at the secondary level has not been as good as expected. This has been a matter of concern. Thus, there has been a continuous focus on exploring newer innovative learner-centered and friendly instructional strategies to enhance understanding and retention in biology. This study, therefore, determined the effects of Concept Mapping (CM) and Cooperative Mastery Learning (CML) on fostering retention in photosynthesis among secondary schools in Nyamagabe district, Rwanda. A pre-test and post-test non-equivalent control group quasi-experimental design was used. Data were obtained from 151 students taught with CM, 144 students taught with CML, and 154 students taught with Conventional Teaching Methods (CTM). The Photosynthesis Retention Test (KR-21= 0.82) was used for data collection. The data were mainly analyze d using mean and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). The results showed that the CM and CML treatment groups outperformed the CTM group in retention in photosynthesis. There was a statistically significant difference in favor of the CM between the two experimental groups. The male and female students taught using CM retained equally in photosynthesis while gender difference was revealed in the mean retention scores of the students exposed to the CML, with females retained significantly higher than males. The study concluded that the CM and CML strategies were more effective than CTM. It was suggested, among other things, that teachers should be encouraged to apply CM and CML strategies when teaching biology.

AB  - This case study investigated two pre-service elementary teachers' changes in beliefs towards mathematics, learning mathematics, and teaching mathematics from the beginning to the end of mathematics methods courses. One of the participants had mathematics learning disability (MLD). The analysis of data gathered using concept maps and interviews at the beginning and end of the method courses revealed mixed findings between the two participants. The findings indicated that both pre-service teachers held negative beliefs before they took methods courses because they believed mathematics was boring, confusing, time-consuming, and a difficult subject. The data also suggested that learning mathematics was difficult and teaching mathematics was challenging. Their negative beliefs were associated primarily with their past school experiences as well as instructional strategies employed at school. One of the participants positively changed her beliefs at the end of the method courses since she described mathematics as a dynamic, creative, and useful subject. However, the other participant with MLD still held negative beliefs primarily about mathematics, as well as for learning and teaching mathematics at the end of the method courses. Data also revealed that utilizing appropriate instructional strategies based on individuals learning styles helped to make learning and teaching mathematics easy and interesting.

AB  - The main focus of the study was to identify the the effects of the ACE teaching cycle approach on students' engagement in learning of Elementary Linear Algebra. The Elementary Linear Algebra course was delivered at the Mathematics Education Study Program of State University of Padang, Indonesia. An action research methodology was adopted for the study and the constructivist theory was used as a theoretical framework. This study used mixed methods to collect, describe, and interpret the data. The data were collected through focus group discussion, classroom observations, and questionnaire. The participants in this study consisted of 37 students enrolled in the Elementary Linear Algebra course during the January-June 2011 semester. The ACE teaching cycle approach that was implemented in this study consisted of three steps. The first step in this cycle was the concept maps activity. This activity encouraged students to prepare for the topics that would be discussed in the class. The next step was classroom discussion which provided a social context in which the students could work together to solve mathematics problems. Finally, exercises were assigned as homework. In this part, students practised solving mathematics problems and wrote reflective journal. Students' involvement in the ACE teaching cycle approach in the Elementary Linear Algebra course improved their engagement in mathematics learning in the three domains of cognitive engagement, affective engagement and behavioural engagement.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel approach to combine domain modelling and student modelling techniques in a single, automated pipeline which does not require expert knowledge and can be used to predict future student performance. Domain modelling techniques map questions to concepts and student modelling techniques generate a mastery score for a concept. We conducted an evaluation using six large datasets from a Python programming course, evaluating the performance of different domain and student modelling techniques. The results showed that it is possible to develop a successful and fully automated pipeline which learns from raw data. The best results were achieved using alternating least squares on hill-climbing Q-matrices as domain modelling and exponential moving average as student modelling. This method outperformed all baselines in terms of accuracy and showed excellent run time. [For the full proceedings, see ED623995.]

AB  - Though concept maps and graphic organisers are useful tools for bilinguals to organise the information being managed and learned, its systematic use is not widened and decisive in CLIL domains. Apart from helping students to acquire meaningful learning, concept mapping might promote in them word-recognition skills for the identification and management of relevant information within foreign language (L2) texts. Hence, this article inquires into the influence of concept maps and graphic organisers as tools for noun category identification from L2 texts. Research sample comprises sixty Spanish primary education students from a bilingual school. Design is quasi-experimental, and the training programme lasted three weeks. Materials used during the training period are not exceptional, but the ordinarily found in regular classrooms. Data gathering procedure consists of the identification and circling of nouns by sample participants. As a starting point, secondary data as the intelligent quotient, learning style, and English level is collected via standardised tests. The analysis of the variance showed a highly significant interaction between the groups and the implemented texts both for noun identification (F[subscript 3.171] = 12.124, p < 0.000, [eta-squared] = 0.175), and the grammatical categories mistakenly identified as nouns (F[subscript 3.171] = 3.840, p < 0.016, [eta-squared] = 0.063).

AB  - The rise in university bilingual science courses is explained by a certain phenomenon, the internationalization of higher education. Bilingual Argument Mapping (BAM) -- the ability to construct argument maps using two languages -- is a key aspect of bilingual scientific literacy. An argument map is a visual representation of argument structure. The problem is that little is known about how to foster BAM in this type of course. The goal of this study was to explore the possibility of using formal and informal formative assessment (FIFA) -- a type of assessment for learning in which feedback is both preplanned and instantaneous --, to support undergraduates' BAM. The data consist of the bilingual argument maps constructed by forty-four students (27 females and 17 males, 18-23 years old) in Colombia during a university Spanish-English bilingual science course. Results indicate that FIFA helped the participants' creation of valid and coherent argument maps in Spanish, in English and in a hybrid version using code-switching as response to argumentative questions related to the scientific topics covered in the course. The potential contributions of FIFA and its implications are discussed in light of research and theory of bilingual science education.

AB  - Background: The goal of this research was to determine students' perceived self-efficacy in science classes through involving students in expanding disciplinary core idea (DCI) and interdisciplinary core idea (ICI) maps, as a method to visualize knowledge (utilizing mind mapping and concept mapping) to support students to integrate interdisciplinary learning. The research involved (a) creating (by science educators) eight curriculum-related, disciplinary core idea maps and two interdisciplinary core idea maps; (b) teachers guiding students in an experimental group, to make interdisciplinary connections so as to expand DCI and ICI maps in an intervention lasting a year and a half from grade 10 to 11; (c) providing feedback on students' developed DCI and ICI maps; (d) administering questionnaires seeking students' perceptions about their self-efficacy towards core ideas, both before and after the intervention and (e) interviewing science teachers (5) and selected students (25), after the intervention, about their perceptions towards the use and outcomes of their DCI and ICI maps. Besides the experimental group, a control group (no intervention) was involved. Results: Outcomes showed that the intervention (guiding students in creating disciplinary and interdisciplinary core idea maps to visualize their learning) supported students significantly in their perceived self-efficacy in the fields of Life Science and Earth Science, plus in the use of Models and Systems. In Physics and Chemistry, the students' perceived self-efficacy was not statistically significantly positive after the conducted intervention. This stemmed from disciplinary core ideas, related to Physics and Chemistry, being more abstract, with students making fewer connections and integrating less new knowledge into the related DCI and ICI maps. In the interviews, both teachers and students stated that the intervention (including expansion of DCI and ICI maps) supported students' science learning. Conclusions: Creating and expanding disciplinary and interdisciplinary core ideas more clearly indicates students' learning, through their ability to make meaningful connections, enabling students to raise their self-efficacy in preparing for their future. The results from this research demonstrate that students' perceived self-efficacy can occur through knowledge visualization by expanding both DCI and ICI maps enabling the making of greater interdisciplinary connections.

AB  - This study was conducted to examine the effects of the socio-scientific issue (SSI) approach assisted by the future thinking map (FTM) on five constructs of future thinking, namely (i) understanding the current situation, (ii) identifying the trends, (iii) analyzing the relevant drivers, (iv) synthesizing the possibilities or needs of the future and (v) choosing with the justification of the desired future. The future-thinking test instrument was developed to measure the level of future thinking. A quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test control group design was employed. A total of 255 form four students (age 16) from three randomly selected rural secondary schools in Tawau District, Malaysia were assigned to (i) SSI-FTM (n = 85), (ii) SSI (n = 85), and (iii) conventional (CV, n = 85) teaching and learning (TL) strategies. The results of the MANCOVA analysis showed that there was a statistically significant effect across all three groups of TL strategies. The ANCOVA analysis showed that there was a statistically significant effect of the SSI-FTM TL strategies compared to the SSI and CV TL strategies on the five future thinking constructs. The quasi-experimental study proves that the SSI-FTM TL strategy is effective in nurturing future thinking among form four students in science lessons.

AB  - This research is conducted to identify the scientific conceptual cognition of ecosystem and the corresponding alternative conceptions by lower-secondary school students in Taiwan. Concept mapping, interviewing, and two-tier diagnostic test cannot make explicit reasoning pathways that students may use. Therefore, its purpose is to develop, validate, and utilize a three-tier multiple-choice diagnostic instrument for the ecosystem concept (TDIEC). The instrument can assist teachers in analyzing their students' reasoning. This does not only distinguish alternative conceptions from lack of knowledge but also determines the percentages of false positives and false negatives. One hundred and six students were tested with this instrument in Taiwan. The data analysis reveals common alternative conceptions shared by students, indicating that 35.59% of the samples had inaccurate conceptualizations of ecosystems. Common alternative conceptions of ecosystems include the following: (1) Only biological components constitute an ecosystem; (2) The Venus flytrap and pitcher plants are preys; (3) Competition is synonymous to predation; (4) Ecological balance refers to the sustainable circulation of energy and matter in the environment; and (5) The simpler the species, the more stable the ecosystem. It concludes with the interpretation of the results, suggestions for the application of the TDIEC, and correct alternative conceptions in Ecology classes.

AB  - The study presented here is an action research that was conducted in a science and technology teaching course in a pre-service elementary teaching program at a private university in Turkey aiming at improving the pre-service elementary teachers' understanding of science and teaching science. In order to achieve this aim, an innovative approach, using Benzene Ring Heuristic (BRH) to introduce scientific practices (SPs) to pre-service elementary teachers was implemented in the study. This heuristic was used to illustrate the interrelatedness of cognitive-epistemic and social-institutional aspects of SPs in a holistic presentation. The data were gathered from various sources, including pre-service teachers' posters, individual lesson plans, and individual interviews. The results suggest that the method helped the pre-service teachers have a coherent and organised understanding of SPs; however, despite the increase in the usage of discourse and social certification, they still have difficulties understanding these issues. In light of evidence gathered from this study, further research includes deliberate attempts to encourage the pre-service teachers to integrate discourse and social certification in their own instruction.

AB  - With the progress and innovation of digital technology, people's knowledge acquisition, information exchange, and communication modes have changed significantly. The universality of emerging technology media enables instructional designers to use digital media to provide different teaching materials and teaching methods to meet the needs of individual learners according to their differences. Accordingly, this study takes the Introduction to Network course as an example, proposes a Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process combined with Rule-Space Model to guide and analyze students' learning status, and imports Microsoft Technology Association international certification as empirical analysis. The study revealed that, the experts believe that "understanding protocols and services" is the most important part of the basic knowledge of the Internet, followed by "understanding network infrastructure" and "understanding network hardware." In the section on learning performance, the average progress rates of two class were 69.44% and 62.20%, respectively, the students' scores were significantly improved. In the section on obtaining Microsoft Technology Association certification, the passing rates were 93.44% and 93.10%, which were significant improvements in certification passing rate. In the future, this study can be applied to other fields to improve the relative learning effect and make it broader and more diversified.

AB  - The typical introductory physics lecture requires students to consolidate and assimilate a large quantity of complex information that is often novel to them. This can leave students overwhelmed, slow the pace of their learning, and lower their motivation. We find that carefully designed multimedia summaries in the form of one-minute videos and short text summaries can significantly increase students' understanding of the material as well as their ability to organize information into a useful mental framework, as measured by their performances on a concept mapping exercise and a conceptual test of learning. Notably, we show that these improvements can be achieved with negligible increase in overall time students spend on the course material each week. We discuss reasons why these short postlecture summaries helped students learn more, namely, that (i) they likely increased students' ability to chunk and organize information while minimizing the extraneous cognitive load imposed by the materials, and (ii) they likely improved students' ability to consolidate and transfer knowledge through the use of contrasting cases. We provide a set of detailed recommendations that instructors can use to develop effective postlecture multimedia summaries. We suggest that one of the most important and impactful recommendations is incorporating student thinking in the design of these types of summaries informed by the input of qualified former students or teaching assistants with significant experience interacting with students in the course.

AB  - This experimental study aimed to replicate and extend a previous efficacy study of an elementary grade content literacy intervention that demonstrated positive effects on students' vocabulary knowledge depth, argumentative writing, and reading comprehension. Using a cluster (school) randomized trial design, this replication experiment was conducted with 5,494 first- and second-grade students in 30 elementary schools in an urban school district located in the southeastern USA. Teachers implemented thematic lessons (20 lessons) that provided an intellectual framework for helping students who acquire networks of related vocabulary knowledge while learning science and social studies content. Teachers integrated thematic lessons, concept mapping, and interactive read-alouds of conceptually related informational texts to enable their students to build networks of vocabulary knowledge and to transfer this knowledge to argumentative writing and collaborative research activities. Confirmatory analyses replicated positive findings on science vocabulary knowledge depth (ES = 0.50) and argumentative writing (ES = 0.24) and also extended positive findings to social studies vocabulary knowledge depth (ES = 0.56) and argumentative writing (ES = 0.44). Positive and statistically significant findings were not replicated on domain-general reading comprehension. Exploratory analyses indicated that students' vocabulary knowledge depth partially mediated the impact of content literacy instruction on domain-specific argumentative writing outcomes.

AB  - The role of metacognitive awareness on language teaching and learning have been confirmed by several studies, but the discussions of this topic in Chinese as foreign language are limited. The aim of the present research was to map metacognitive awareness profile of Chinese language learners. Total respondent of this research was 80 Chinese language learners (38 males and 42 females) which comprise secondary students. Convenience sampling technique was employed to select the respondents. Meanwhile, the metacognitive awareness data were collected utilizing Junior Metacognitive Inventory. The obtained data were analyzed using descriptive statistic. Mann-Whitney U Test was employed to investigate the significance differences of metacognitive awareness between male and female. The findings showed that 46.25% of Chinese Language Learners have a good metacognitive knowledge, 28.75% fair, 20% very good, 3.75% poor, and 1.25% very lacking. The finding also showed that 40% students have good metacognitive regulation, 36.25% fair, 15% very good, 7.50% poor, and 1.25% very lacking. In addition, between male and female students have no significant difference in knowledge of cognition. On the contrary, regulation of cognition female learners (Mdn= 32.50) significantly (U= 551.000, p>0.05) better compared to male (Mdn= 30).

AB  - No consensus has been reached so far concerning the key topics on quantum physics suitable for secondary school teaching, despite comprehensive research. We identified the the variety of associations with quantum physics among professionals as a potential cause. From an explorative mind map study with N = 29 physics researchers, we derive six subject-specific focal points in the associations that researchers have with quantum physics.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of concept maps on the academic achievements of Biology teacher candidates and the elimination of misconceptions comparing the method with the traditional rote learning method. The quasi-experimental design, specifically, the pre- and post-test control group type was used in this research to address the research questions. The research was carried out with 60 Biology teacher candidates. Achievement test and diagnostic test were used as data collection tools throughout the research. SPSS version 20 software was used to analyze the obtained quantitative data. Independent samples t-test was used to determine, whether there was a significant difference between the control and experimental group students' level of prior knowledge regarding the subject of protein synthesis. The findings revealed no statistically significant difference between the groups in pre-test (? > 0.05). However, the findings revealed a statistically significant difference between the groups, in the post-test, in favor of the concept map method used for the experiment group (? < 0.05). The increase in the post-test scores of the experiment group students indicated that the teaching method based on concept maps positively affected the students' academic achievement and elimination of misconceptions. Research indicated that students could not establish a correct relationship between the concepts of DNA, RNA, mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, nucleus, chromosome, gene, genetic code, codon, anticodon, translation, transcription, ribosome, protein, and amino acid terms taught in protein synthesis subject. It was concluded that the areas of use for concept maps should not be limited as a teaching tool, but should be further extended to for determining misconceptions, eliminating misconceptions, and evaluating the instruction.

AB  - This study developed and validated an assessment that measures interdisciplinary understanding using the topic of carbon cycling, the Interdisciplinary Science Assessment for Carbon Cycling (ISACC). This work was motivated by the need to assess interdisciplinary understanding, defined as the ability to solve problems requiring knowledge and skills from multiple disciplines. Levels of a construct map for interdisciplinary understanding were generated and refined in the construct-modeling design process (Wilson 2005). Key concepts in carbon cycling to be assessed were determined based on experts' concept maps and analysis of the Next Generation Science Standards. The final version of the ISACC includes 11 multiple-choice (MC) items and eight constructed-response (CR) items covering nine key concepts. Of these 19 items, six are single-disciplinary items and 13 are interdisciplinary items. Four hundred fifty-four students in grades 9-16 were recruited and administered the ISACC. For the CR items, scoring rubrics were developed and used by a group of evaluators to code student responses. Two item response theory models, a two-parameter logistic model and a generalized partial credit model, provided evidence of the construct validity of the items. All items reflected unidimensionality and local independence and showed moderate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.782). All except one were a good fit to the models. The findings suggest that the ISACC is a promising tool to assess interdisciplinary understanding of carbon cycling. Future directions include research into test fairness across gender and ethnic/racial groups and further development to cover typical high school students' knowledge more thoroughly.

AB  - Active inquiry plays a key role in science education. To facilitate children's motivation, alternate reality games are applied to engage children actively in inquiry in authentic learning contexts. However, the complexity of real-world contexts and the ambiguity of game puzzles increase the difficulty for children to conduct effective inquiries. To achieve successful inquiry-based learning, concept mapping is an effective learning strategy to guide children to organise related information as well as to brainstorm for possible solutions. Accordingly, this study proposes a mobile concept mapping-based questioning approach for environmental education. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the conventional questioning approach in game-based inquiry-based learning. The results showed that the proposed approach had a more significant effect on learning achievement, critical thinking, and learning attitude than the conventional questioning approach. However, cognitive overload negatively affected the children's learning. Besides, it was found that improper use of concept maps could limit their creative problem-solving performances.

AB  - This study explores emergent reflective structuration as a new form of shared regulation. The purpose is to support students in taking on high-level epistemic agency as they co-configure dynamic inquiry pathways that unfold over long periods of time. With the teacher's support, students not only regulate their inquiry and collaboration following pre-scripted structures, but they also co-construct shared inquiry pathways to frame and reframe their community practices in response to progress and needs that emerge over time. Our data analysis investigates the temporal and interactional processes by which members of a Grade 5 classroom co-configured their knowledge building pathways in a yearlong science inquiry focusing on the human body systems. As a co-constructed structure, students co-formulated an evolving chart of "big questions" that signified shared inquiry directions with the teacher's support. The inquiry process was supported by Knowledge Form and Idea Thread Mapper, which visualizes the online knowledge building discourse based on temporal streams of inquiry focusing on the "big questions." Qualitative analysis of classroom observation notes, videos, student artifacts, online discourse, and student interviews documented nine "big questions" co-formulated by the community over time. Further analysis revealed students' agentic moves to expand, deepen, and reframe the knowledge building work of their community. Analyses of online discourse and a pre-and post-test showed productive idea contributions, interactions, and knowledge outcomes. Conceptual and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - The main objective of this study is to evaluate the social studies education literature in Turkey through systematic bibliometric analysis. The science mapping method was employed to analyze studies. 252 studies that were extracted from the Web of Science (WoS) database were analyzed. The findings revealed that the number of studies has been dramatically increased in the last decade. Besides, It was found that the majority of publications were published in local journals. Moreover, theses produced in this field are the most cited sources in the articles. It was also concluded that even though there are 65 social studies education departments in Turkish universities, only a few numbers of them made collaborations in the publications. Besides, it was found that there are no multi-country collaborations in social studies education literature in Turkey.

AB  - Understanding the nature of science and scientific inquiry constitute foundation stones in scientific education in general and in scientific literacy in particular. Therefore, students must develop informed perceptions regarding science inquiry in order to be scientifically literate. The current study's purpose was to examine students' perceptions regarding science inquiry (SI). This would provide deep description of students' naïve and informed perceptions of SI, and also locate flawed thinking patterns regarding SI. The unique contribution of the research is expressed in both mapping the concepts about knowledge of scientific research in Israel and extracting and naming the concepts that the students have. The research population included 446 students in grades 7-8. This research chose a quantitative research approach. The study used a questionnaire called VASI (Views About Science Inquiry). This is a research questionnaire intended to diagnose students' perceptions regarding science inquiry. The study's findings indicate that most of the students do not develop informed understanding regarding the aspects of science inquiry. The aspects about which the students' have the most informed responses among the students are that the question motivates the inquiry and that the study's conclusions should match the data collected. The conclusion arising from the findings is that the students lack scientific perceptions regarding a significant proportion of the aspects of science inquiry, which raises the great importance of focused instruction of the aspects of science inquiry in class. Therefore, perhaps training teachers professionally to teach science inquiry directly in the classroom may develop the student's' scientific perceptions.

AB  - Teleological reasoning is viewed as a major hurdle to evolution education, and yet, eliciting, interpreting, and reflecting upon teleological language presents an arguably greater challenge to the evolution educator and researcher. This article argues that making explicit the role of behavior as a causal factor in the evolution of particular traits may prove productive in helping students to link their everyday experience of behavior to evolutionary changes in populations in ways congruent with scientific perspectives. We present a teaching tool, used widely in other parts of science and science education, yet perhaps underutilized in human evolution education--the causal map--as a novel direction for driving conceptual change in the classroom about the role of organism behavior and other factors in evolutionary change. We describe the scientific and conceptual basis for using such causal maps in human evolution education, as well as theoretical considerations for implementing the causal mapping tool in human evolution classrooms. Finally, we offer considerations for future research and educational design.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the views of preservice science teachers on concept map use in a General Chemistry II class. The study was conducted with 47 preservice science teachers. In the study, an interview form grounded on determining their views on concept maps and comprised of open-ended questions, was used as the data collection tool. In analysis of the data acquired, content analysis was performed. As a result of the analysis of the data, the preservice teachers expressed positive views on concept map use. They stated that it might contribute to their learning and increase the permanence of the knowledge learned. Furthermore, they reported that they liked creating concept maps and among the concept map types they usually chose to create hierarchical concept maps. Most of the preservice teachers stated that they had to know the subject related to the concept map very well to create concept maps more easily, otherwise they might have a difficulty in the concept map creation process and thus concept maps should generally be used after a lecture. In addition the preservice teachers stated that they intended to use concept maps in their teaching experience. As a result, before concept maps are used in teaching, it is recommended to inform students about the creation of concept maps, to use them for re-purpose in teaching activities, and to include activities containing concept maps in textbooks.

AB  - Autograding systems are being increasingly deployed to meet the challenges of teaching programming at scale. Studies show that formative feedback can greatly help novices learn programming. This work extends an autograder, enabling it to provide formative feedback on programming assignment submissions. Our methodology starts with the design of a knowledge map, which is the set of concepts and skills that are necessary to complete an assignment, followed by the design of the assignment and that of a comprehensive test suite for identifying logical errors in the submitted code. Test cases are used to test the student submissions and learn classes of common errors. For each assignment, we train a classifier that automatically categorizes errors in a submission based on the outcome of the test suite. The instructor maps the errors to corresponding concepts and skills and writes hints to help students find their misconceptions and mistakes. We apply this methodology to two assignments in our Introduction to Computer Science course and find that the automatic error categorization has a 90% average accuracy. We report and compare data from two semesters, one semester when hints are given for the two assignments and one when hints are not given. Results show that the percentage of students who successfully complete the assignments after an initial erroneous submission is three times greater when hints are given compared to when hints are not given. However, on average, even when hints are provided, almost half of the students fail to correct their code so that it passes all the test cases. The initial implementation of the framework focuses on the functional correctness of the programs as reflected by the outcome of the test cases. In our future work, we will explore other kinds of feedback and approaches to automatically generate feedback to better serve the educational needs of the students.

AB  - Retrieval practice enhances the learning of educational materials, and prior work has shown that practicing retrieval can enhance learning as much as or more than creating concept maps. Few studies have combined retrieval practice with other learning activities, and no prior work has explored whether concept mapping and retrieval practice might produce especially robust effects when the two activities are combined. In two experiments, students studied educational texts and practiced retrieval (by freely recalling the texts), created concept maps, or completed both activities. In the combined-activity condition, students studied and created concept maps prior to practicing retrieval. On a 1-week delayed assessment, practicing retrieval enhanced learning relative to creating concept maps. Surprisingly, combining concept mapping and retrieval practice failed to produce any benefit over retrieval practice without concept mapping, even though students in the combined condition spent substantially more time engaged with the materials than did students in single-activity conditions.

AB  - Learning progressions (LPs) are descriptions of students' growing sophistication in the understanding of a particular construct through a curricular sequence. They are particularly useful for organizing complex constructs for which students do not necessarily connect concepts as taught in different courses. However, they are challenging to construct, because they attempt to linearize students' inherently nonlinear learning. As a result, it is essential to have methods to assess students' arrival at particular steps along the progression. One tool readily available to instructors is concept inventories (CIs). We have mapped published CIs to LPs for acid-base chemistry. The alignment not only provides an assessment that professors can use to pinpoint student learning, but also creates another tool to verify hypothetical LPs. We have compared the types of questions asked on CIs in chemistry, biology, and biochemistry, as well as in some standardized test banks. The mapping of questions from CIs to steps on the LPs allows refinement of the LPs and reveals gaps in assessment tools for sophisticated concepts. This alignment is a novel addition to the cycle of validation of an LP.

AB  - Higher-order thinking is crucial to inquiry learning. It is important to investigate how students think in inquiry contexts. Given the tacit nature of higher-order thinking, cognitive maps (e.g., concept maps, reasoning maps) have been used to externalize thinking and have shown promising effects in terms of improving inquiry task performance. However, few studies have analyzed student-constructed maps that reflect the thinking underpinning students' inquiry task performance. This study aimed to address this gap. Sixty-nine 11th grade students worked in small groups to explain a fish die-off phenomenon in a virtual ecosystem and collaboratively constructed an integrative cognitive map to facilitate thinking during the task. The map comprised a concept map (representing conceptual thinking about relevant subject knowledge) and a reasoning map (representing the reasoning process). Regression analyses showed that the quality of the student-constructed maps, particularly the reasoning maps, was a significant predictor of inquiry task performance assessed based on students' written explanations of the phenomenon. Although the quality of the concept maps was not a significant predictor of inquiry task performance, it did predict the quality of the reasoning maps. Student thinking reflected in concept mapping and that reflected in reasoning mapping play different roles in inquiry learning.

AB  - Giving and receiving peer feedback is seen as an important vehicle for deep learning. Defining assessment criteria is a first step in giving feedback to peers and can play an important role in feedback providers' learning. However, there is no consensus about whether it is better to ask students to think about assessment criteria themselves or to provide them with ready-made assessment criteria. The current experimental study aims at answering this question in a secondary school STEM educational context, during a physics lesson in an online inquiry learning environment. As a part of their lesson, participants (n = 93) had to give feedback on two concept maps, and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions--being provided or not being provided with assessment criteria. Students' post-test scores, the quality of feedback given, and the quality of students' own concept maps were analyzed to determine if there was an effect of condition on feedback providers' learning. Results did not reveal an advantage of one condition over the other in terms of learning gains. Possible implications for practice and directions for further research are discussed.

AB  - Employing scientific reasoning when giving biological explanations comes easily to the experienced scientist. However, students often encounter difficulty when they attempt to explain biological phenomena. One significant obstacle appears to be the failure or inability to bear in mind the levels of organization. To address this issue, learning strategies, such as the yo-yo learning and teaching strategy, recommend moving across the levels of organization and making those levels explicit in the explanation. To support yo-yo learning, we developed a new graphic organizer, the zoom map. The zoom map combines the levels of organization with concept maps. It is specifically tailored to guide students in biology on ways to distinguish, interrelate and reflect the levels of organization. In this paper, we introduce the zoom map as a tool for instruction and diagnosis. We also provide evidence from teaching experiments that demonstrate how the zoom map benefited learning.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the concepts that primary school fourth-grade students reveal with their mind maps related to four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and to compare the mind map and achievement test scores. In the study, a mixed method was used in which quantitative and qualitative data were collected and presented together. The study was carried out with a total of 14 students. There were eight girls and six boys, who studying in the fourth-grade of a primary school in Mentese district of Mugla, in the spring semester of the 2019-2020 academic year. In the research, mind maps created for four operations and success test were used as data collection tools. The data collection process was carried out simultaneously. In the analysis of the data, qualitative data were transformed into the quantitative analysis, and quantitative analyzes were made. Concepts in mind maps created for four operations were subjected to qualitative analysis and photos were added as evidence. As a result of the research, it was determined that the majority of the students adopted the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Besides, it was revealed that there was a high-level positive relationship between the scores of the students obtained from the achievement test and the scores from the mind maps they created. The evaluation made using the mind map for primary school fourth-grade students is more advantageous than the achievement test in terms of determining the conceptual understanding.

AB  - This study examined the effect of mind mapping instructional strategy on students' retention in physics in senior secondary schools. The research is a quasi-experimental design of the pre-test, post-test, non-equivalent and non-randomized 2 X 2 X 3 factorial design. 64 students were sampled for this study out of which 28 formed the experimental group (mind mapping instructional strategy) while 36 of the respondents constituted the control group (conventional method). The pre-test and post-test contained 20 multiple-choice questions with four options one of which was the key factor while others were distractors. Multiple-choice questions were validated by three university professors. A retention test was also conducted after 2 weeks of the whole exercise. Data collected were analysed using the mean and standard deviation to answer the research question while hypotheses were tested using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) and independent t-test at 0.05 significant level. Findings revealed among others that there was a significant effect of the mind mapping instructional strategy in physics in senior secondary schools It was therefore, recommended among others that mind mapping instructional strategy should be used to teach physics concept at the senior secondary school level of education for a better performance because it improves students' performances in physics.

AB  - Scholars have suggested that flipped learning can be enhanced by designing effective in-class learning activities to improve students' higher order thinking skills. Problem posing has been recognized as such a learning strategy that has great potential for improving students' higher order thinking skills. However, it has been reported as a challenging task for most students. Research evidence has indicated the potential of engaging students in group learning with step-by-step hints when conducting problem-posing activities. Therefore, this study proposed a multilevel concept mapping-based problem-posing strategy to assist students in completing the problem-posing tasks in flipped learning. To understand the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, a flipped learning system was developed and adopted in the science class of an elementary school. Seventy-five fifth graders from three classes were divided into experimental group A, experimental Group B and a control group. Students in Group A used the concept map-guided problem-posing strategy for flipped learning (CMPP-FL), students in Group B used the problem-posing strategy-based flipped learning, while students in the control group used the conventional flipped learning strategy. The results showed that the CMPP-FL was effective in terms of improving students' learning performance, especially for students with higher levels of critical thinking tendency.

AB  - Students in Indonesia still have the low level of scientific argumentation skills. This study purposed to examine the impact of Problem-based Learning (PBL) with Argument Mapping and Online Laboratory in improving the scientific argumentation skill. It describes the significance of the differences between participants who learn through PBL, PBL with Online Laboratory (PBL-OL), Problem-based Learning with Argument Mapping and Online Laboratory (PBL-AMOL) model. The population of this study were students from Madrasah Aliyah Negeri (MAN) Yogyakarta, Indonesia with a random sampling technique. This was quasi-experiment with pre and post test designs. In this study, there were 97 students at MAN 1 as respondent. Paired sample t-test, independent sample t-test and ANOVA mixed design was used to analysis data. The PBL-AMOL group has a significant difference based on pre-test and post-test (sig. 0000). The PBL-AMOL was most effective to improve the skill with gain score 0.43 (medium). Learning with the PBLAMOL model can be an alternative to solve the problems of creative thinking skill.

AB  - The motivation for the design of this study was to understand the possibility and impact of the involvement of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) professionals on school STEM education. This involved two stages, with the design of a set of authentic STEM inquiry activities firstly and implementation in primary classrooms secondly. Five teachers from a local primary school, who were making their first attempt in implementing STEM learning with students at senior primary levels, participated in this study. The teachers worked collaboratively with an Environmental Scientist with support from the research team to design authentic STEM activities to solve a problem which is currently affecting the school environment. The study used a qualitative approach with teachers' pre- and post-concept maps, self-reflections and interviews to capture changes in teachers' STEM conceptions. The findings showed that "School-STEM Professionals' Collaboration" had a positive impact on teachers' conceptions of STEM education and STEM professionals.

AB  - This study introduces issue concept maps (IC map) as an instructional tool for exploring students' idea about socio-scientific issues (SSI). By visualizing students' ideas in two dimensions, context and occurrence, IC maps represent what kinds of ideas students have on the issues, and how their ideas change and connect. In the study, we implemented a SSI program on fine dust for 77 seventh graders and used IC maps to investigate how their ideas changed after the program. Students collaboratively constructed IC maps in groups before and after the program. Results show that the number of ideas written on IC maps significantly increased after the program from 92 to 254 ideas, indicating that the program contributed to enhancing students' awareness about the issues in terms of its causes, effects, and countermeasures at various context levels. Students also presented a greater variety of types of connections among their ideas after the program.

AB  - With the advancements in technology networks, mobile learning has been extensively applied in teaching contexts, enabling closer interaction between students and authentic environments. Previous studies have indicated that, when learning in real-world contexts, students need to interact with real learning targets and peers as well as the digital learning content; thus, effective learning strategies or tools are generally required for helping them organize knowledge and for promoting peer interactions. As a result, the present study developed a bi-directional peer-assessment-based concept mapping system, which not only engages students in assessing peers' concept maps, but also encourages them to evaluate or respond to peers' ratings and comments. To explore the effectiveness of this learning system, the study conducted an experiment in elementary science classes. A total of 101 fifth graders from four classes were recruited to participate in the study. Two classes were assigned to the experimental group and two to the control group. The experimental group adopted the bi-directional peer-assessment approach, while the control group adopted the conventional peer assessment approach for concept mapping. The results reveal that the bi-directional peer-assessment-based concept mapping system can not only increase students' learning achievement and the completeness of their concept mapping, but can also enhance their critical thinking tendency and the feedback quality of their peer assessment.

AB  - Concept Mapping (CM) is a learning strategy to organize and understand complex relationships, which are particularly characteristic of the natural science subjects. Previous research has already shown that constructing concept maps can promote students' meaningful learning in terms of deeper knowledge and its more flexible use. While researchers generally agree that students need to practice using CM successfully for learning, key parameters of effective CM training (e.g., content, structure, and duration) remain controversial. This desideratum is taken up by our study, in which three different training approaches were evaluated: a CM training with scaffolding and feedback vs. a CM training without additional elements vs. a non-CM control training. In a quasi-experimental design, we assessed the learning outcome of N = 73 university students who each had participated in one of the trainings before. Our results suggest that an extensive CM training with scaffolding and feedback is most appropriate to promote both CM competence and acquisition of knowledge. From an educational perspective, it would therefore be advisable to accept the time-consuming process of intensive practice of CM in order to enable students to adequately use of the strategy and thus facilitate meaningful learning in terms of achieving sustained learning success.

AB  - Concept mapping (CM) can be an effective strategy to facilitate understanding-based learning of complex and abstract scientific content. In our study, we tried to answer two questions that have not yet been clarified: (1) How effective is CM if the learners do not have the textual learning material available when constructing their concept maps (retrieval setting) in contrast to when the material is available (elaboration setting)? (2) Do potential effects of the two settings depend on the intensity of a previous CM strategy training? To this end, we established a quasi-experimental four-group plan and collected data of N = 93 undergraduate students. The participants received either a detailed CM strategy training or just a short introduction and were then asked to apply CM in a retrieval or elaboration setting. The quality of constructed concept maps and content-related learning success were assessed to determine potential group differences. Overall, our results show a significantly positive but setting-independent effect of the CM strategy training on methodical CM skills. However, the different setting conditions differed neither regarding concept map quality nor content-related learning success, implying that CM in retrieval settings could be as effective as in elaboration settings.

AB  - The current article addressed middle school (13-15 years old) students' science-related career awareness (SCA) and aimed to determine the effects of a longitudinal intervention, which focused on integrating career education into science teaching, using a pre- and post-test design. During the intervention, five teaching/learning modules (TLMs) were implemented in science lessons that enabled students to experience being (1) an electrical engineer, (2) a food technologist, (3) a forensic scientist or a civil engineer, (4) a team member of oil catastrophe simulation clean-up team, and (5) a customs' officer. Concept mapping was used to determine the changes in students' SCA. The suitability of this technique was validated through semi-structured focus group interviews. It was found that concept mapping enabled detection of progression in the intervention students' SCA among both boys and girls. The interviews provided valuable input on how students interpreted science-related occupations and relevant competences, when constructing their concept maps. An implication from this study was that SCA supportive teaching and learning modules or other similar teaching methods needed to be an inherent part of science teaching to support students making well informed decisions, either towards or away from science-related careers.

AB  - Collaboration is regarded as one of the core competences of the 21st century when it comes to complex problem solving. In response to high dropout rates among STEM students, we developed a digital-collaborative intervention on a difficult topic, MO theory, for first-year chemistry students. First, students work independently in a Digital Learning Environment (DLE). Afterwards, they collaborate in small groups and create Concept Maps on MO theory. We evaluate this intervention through knowledge tests, tests of attractiveness, cognitive load, and usability during the DLE and concept mapping process, as well as audio and screen recordings during the collaborative group processes. This paper presents the detailed study design together with results from a first study in January 2021, focusing on the practicability of the intervention and students' feedback. Overall, each small group succeeded in creating a Concept Map. Students rated all phases of the intervention as attractive, with high usability and low cognitive load, although the interactive videos scored better for attractiveness and usability than the concept mapping process. On that basis, first adjustments for a second cycle of the intervention, which will be conducted in January 2022, were derived.

AB  - Interdisciplinary science learning can play a central role in promoting students' 21st century skills. However, students tend to have low perceived self-efficacy towards 21st century skills, thus limiting the application of their actual scientific competence. This study seeks, based on a 1.5-year intervention study, to promote students' perceived self-efficacy towards 21st century skills through science learning compared to a non-experimental group. During the intervention, everyday life-related scenarios were utilized, with students guided to create core idea maps. Data on students' perceived self-efficacy were collected before and after the intervention. Results showed that students' perceived self-efficacy towards 21st century skills changed in a significantly positively way after the intervention.

AB  - There is widespread evidence showing that concept maps are effective for learning. However, little is known about the effects of various concept map activities. We conducted an experiment to examine the comparative effectiveness of three concept map activities: (1) translating a complete map to a paragraph format; (2) filling in concepts in a partial map; and (3) filling in labels in a partial map. Undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory general chemistry course were randomly assigned to the three groups. Each concept map depicted the relationships between concepts on the topic of reaction enthalpy. Results showed that the map-translation group significantly outperformed the fill-in-concepts and fill-in-labels groups in conceptual understanding indicated by open-ended questions while there were no significant differences among the three groups in conceptual understanding indicated by multiple-choice questions.

AB  - Over 40 years of research, concept maps have shown that they are beneficial for learning. However, much of this research has been conducted in laboratory settings. Although there are a few studies conducted in the classroom, there is little understanding of the instructional efficacy of using different types of concept maps. In a between-subjects design, the present study investigates the effects of learning chemistry in a large undergraduate classroom with three concept mapping activities: static, fill-in-concepts, and fill-in-labels. Students reviewed a static map or completed a fill-in-the-blank concept map. Results show that students studying static concept maps outperformed those who engaged with the fill-in-the-blank concept maps. Further, prior knowledge was found to be a significant predictor of learning performance. Additional findings show that the accuracy of completing partial concept maps mediates the influence of concept map format on learning. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - It is challenging to utilize learning analytic technologies to examine gameplay log data for game-embedded assessment in the field of game-based learning. Analytical approaches based on a new perspective focusing on complicated contextual data are imperative in the current scenario. A relatively new concept called precision education, which focuses on individual learning and provides personalized and timely intervention to different learners, can be regarded as a new perspective for game-based learning. Additionally, the order of knowledge acquisition in the learning environment is a kind of learning path extracted from the contextual information of in-game behavior logs. Therefore, in this study, the authors propose a new analytical approach to identify learning path patterns and elucidate the features of these patterns for an educational game they developed. The statistical analysis shows that learners with diverse learning path patterns have different learning effects, suggesting that the learning path is an important factor in precision education. The practice of using the explanation method to examine the proposed approach can help us understand learners' knowledge acquisition and provide evidence for enhancing the accuracy of precision education and improving the quality of the educational game. The findings are expected to contribute to both game-based learning and precision education.

AB  - This article focuses on the integration of argumentation and digital technologies in science teacher education. We present theoretical reflections, results of empirical research, and description of innovative experiences with pre- and in-service biology teachers. Regarding argumentation, we analyse what defending a claim in science entails for teachers, the teaching strategies they (would) use in the classroom in relation to argumentation, the relevance that they attribute to the performance of different tasks for arguing, the subject content where argumentation fits more suitably, and the reasons they would consider in favour of arguing in science classes. For the analysis of educational practices that involve use of technologies, we adopt a perspective that looks at their complexity and recognises teachers as their creative authors. We discuss the way in which teachers (would) use technologies in their practice, their expectations around this, and the foreseen results with students. Finally, we examine three innovative educational experiences already implemented, using argument maps, web-based inquiry, and a digital game. We look into the possibilities that these technological resources offer for teachers to analyse the argumentation levels reached by their students.

AB  - This paper reports on the findings from the use of concept maps in a mathematics foundation course at a university in Kuwait. The study sample consisted of 130 freshmen students from a mathematics foundation course. Through a case-study design, concept maps and assessment tests were utilized to assess and monitor students' mathematical understanding and achievement at various points of the course. The findings of the study showed that concept maps can be effective as a tool to assess, monitor, and improve students' mathematical understanding, particularly their conceptual understanding when they are used systematically and when their use is followed-up by discussions that encourage students to reflect and talk about their maps and the links they have made. The improved understanding was found to contribute to the enhancement of mathematical achievement. The paper reports details on the use of concept maps in mathematics lessons and makes recommendations for practice and future research.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine a week-long science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) project-based learning (PBL) activity that integrates a new educational technology and the engineering design process to teach middle and high school students the concepts involved in rotational physics. The technology and teaching method described in this paper can be applied to a wide variety of STEM content areas. Design/methodology/approach: As an educational technology, the dynamic and interactive mathematical expressions (DIME) map system automatically generates an interactive, connected concept map of mathematically based concepts extracted from a portable document format textbook chapter. Over five days, students used DIME maps to engage in meaningful self-guided learning within the engineering design process and STEM PBL. Findings: Using DIME maps within a STEM PBL activity, students explored the physics behind spinning objects, proposed multiple creative designs and built a variety of spinners to meet specified criteria and constraints. Practical implications: STEM teachers can use DIME maps and STEM PBL to support their students in making connections between what they learn in the classroom and real-world scenarios. Social implications: For any classroom with computers, tablets or phones and an internet connection, DIME maps are an accessible educational technology that provides an alternative representation of knowledge for learners who are underserved by traditional methods of instruction. Originality/value: For STEM teachers and education researchers, the activity described in this paper uses advances in technology (DIME maps and slow-motion video capture on cell phones) and pedagogy (STEM PBL and the engineering design process) to enable students to engage in meaningful learning.

AB  - The aims of the study were analyzing students' understanding and skills to make concept mapping in work energy matter through C-Map application software. True experimental method with randomized control group pre-test and post-test design was utilized in the research method. The research involved 72 public high school students from second semester, 10th grade in Indonesia, composed of 36 students in an experiment group (EG) and 36 students in control group (CG). Data were collected by giving a test of work and energy to evaluate students' understanding through C-Map application during Spring Semester 2019. A specific rubric from the previous researchers was used to evaluate students' skills in developing concept map. Analysis of data used independent t-test and normalized gain (Ngain). The independent test revealed the implementation of C-Map application affected in improving students' understanding of work and energy. Students' understanding of these concepts performed that EG higher than CG. It was supported by the obtained of normalized gain (N-gain). The N-gain of EG and CG was 0.39 and 0.26, respectively. Students' skill to make concept mapping in the topic of work and energy through C-Map application achieved 81.36 of 100 with a very good category. C-Map application guide students to arrange the hierarchical structure concept of work and energy, construct concept from focus question and see how the concept related with another concept.

AB  - Concept maps are used to assess and improve prospective teachers' conceptual understanding levels. In this research, the aim was to describe prospective science teachers' conceptual understanding of the atom by using concept maps. The research employed the case study approach, one of the qualitative research patterns. The research group consisted of 15 fourth-year prospective science teachers. The concept maps drawn by the participants were used to describe their conceptual understanding of the atom. For data analysis, the descriptive analysis method, one of the qualitative analysis methods, was used. The data obtained from the concept maps were divided into the categories previously defined by the researcher. The created categories were evaluated by two academics with expertise in physics education, and a correspondence analysis was conducted. As a result of the research, it was concluded that prospective teachers could establish successful and meaningful propositions in concept maps, however, most of the propositions were collected in the categories of "meaningless," "improvable," or "acceptable."

AB  - In this paper we outline the use of a concept mapping narrative method to elicit the complex and interconnected conceptualisations of specialized knowledge (assessment literacy) for a specific cohort of participants (teacher-examiners). In particular, we are interested in exploring how relational concept mapping and narrative interviews can be used as a tool for gathering participant's perspectives through encouraging them to organize and represent their ideas on a topic. In our analysis we identify two research challenges that we explore through the use of the methodology: (1) the codification challenge of how to gain information that participants may not find easy to access or express; and (2) the quality challenge of how to capture nuanced information. Our observations suggest that participants employ content and structural features in their maps to move from conceptual simplicity to complexity, to construct a cohesive narrative, and to maintain a self-regulated focus in that construction process.

AB  - Developing students' ability to think about systems, as opposed to isolated facts, is of central importance in much of science teaching. Prior work in this area has focused on students' recognition of the processes occurring within a system. Comparatively, little work has been done on how students organise the objects that are contained within the system. Understanding how objects are organised within a system structure can promote understanding of the processes relating to the objects and advance students' thinking about systems. A systematic literature review revealed different existing theoretical perspectives on object arrangement within systems. These perspectives were combined into a single framework, the Systems Object Framework (SOF), that can be used to characterise student ideas about object arrangements. The SOF was used to analyse object arrangements depicted by students in pre and post-concept maps that were collected as part of a study on a systems-based curriculum. This analysis provided support for the structure of the SOF and showed that the SOF allows for tracking of changes in students' representation of object arrangements. The SOF contributes to the field by proposing new questions to be investigated and providing a common analytical tool that permits greater consistency across future studies.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to determine pre-service primary school teachers' cognitive structure regarding communication, cooperation and decision-making skills, which are among the basic life skills addressed in the Life Sciences curriculum. The study employed qualitative research method. The study group of was composed of 111 pre-service primary school teachers taking the course "Life Sciences Teaching" at the Department of Primary School Teacher Training in a state university located in the Marmara region of Turkey. A word association test prepared to test the skills addressed in the current study was used as the data collection tool. This word association test focused on three of the basic life skills; communication, cooperation and decision-making skills. By examining the words written by the pre-service primary school teachers related to these three skills in a detailed manner, a frequency table showing how many times the concepts were repeated was prepared and on the basis of the cut-off points, concept maps were developed. As a result of the analysis, it was found that the pre-service primary school teachers produced a total of 154 concepts in relation to the three skills. When the concepts most frequently produced by the pre-service primary school teachers were examined, it was found that "human" was the concept most frequently produced for the communication skill, "group" was the concept most frequently produced for the cooperation skill and "reaching a conclusion" was the concept most frequently produced for the decision-making skill.

AB  - Biology is a complex science that includes different subjects. As a result, misconceptions, confusion and misleading are common problems in biology education. In this study, it was aimed to determine the learning of pre-service science teachers about food web. The research, using the case study, was conducted in 2019-2020. The study group of the research consists of 76 pre-service science teachers. The structured interview form and focus group interview were used to collect the data. As a result of the research, it was determined that pre-service science teachers have misconceptions, confusion and misleading about food web. When the reasons for the pre-service science teachers' misconceptions, confusion and misleading about food web were examined, it was found out that teachers, textbooks, supplementary textbooks and individual errors were the reasons. Pre-service science teachers should be supported with scientific training in order to learn the food web correctly. In addition, international scientific books should be used in the preparation of textbooks on food web.

AB  - The presented research focuses on verifying the confluent application of concept mapping (CM) and socio-scientific issues (SSI) according to the value-laden and moral dilemma orientation to construct problem-solving performance. This research sets up some perspectives for all 146 participants, including 139 students and 7 experts. All findings reveal that the design of SSICM contexts includes a rebuttal process and incense claim to improve students' argument response (16.4%), to increase content knowledge and illuminate their science learning by argumentations. To develop an assessment tool with high validity and reliability (Cronbach's [alpha] > 0.9) and find positive presentations of all learning attitudes in the SSICM context, learning environment and results will concern the best argumentation process. Students' interview responses and SWOT analysis of teachers indicate that SSICM's use of argument in the classroom is a real benefit. The research provided a better paradigm of attempts to combine analytical and academic hypotheses to explain literature sources by teachers, researchers, textbook developers, and editors.

AB  - Biostatisticians apply statistical methods to solve problems in the biological sciences. Successful practioners of biostatistics have advanced technical knowledge, are skilled communicators, and can seamlesslessly integrate with interdisciplinary scientific teams. Despite the breadth of skills required for success in this field, most biostatistics education programs place heavier emphasis on development of technical skills than skills necessary for collaborative work, including critical thinking, writing, and public speaking. Our master's degree program in biostatistics aims for stronger integration of education in collaborative work alongside development of technical knowledge in biostatistics. Toward that end, we propose a model that provides students with a mental map for practicing biostatistics, and that can serve as a tool for faculty to create hands-on learning experiences for biostatistics students. The model helps students organize their knowledge of biostatistics, unifying the technical and collaborative aspects of the discipline in a single framework that can be applied across the broad array of activities that biostatisticians engage in. In this article we describe the model in detail and provide an initial assessment of whether the model might meet its intended purpose by applying the model to a common task for practicing biostatisticians and biostatistics students: describing the results of a medical research study.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: During the education of future engineers and experts in the field of computer science and information communication technology, the achievement of learning outcomes related to different levels of cognitive ability and knowledge dimensions can be a challenge. Background: Teachers need to design an appropriate set of activities for students and combine theory-based knowledge acquisition with practical training in technical skills. Including various activities for formative assessment during the course can positively affect students' motivation for learning and ensure appropriate and timely feedback that will guide students in further learning. Methodology: The aim of the research presented in this paper is to propose an approach for course delivery in the field of software engineering and to determine whether the use of the approach increases student's academic achievement. Using the proposed approach, the course Process Modeling for undergraduate students was redesigned and experimental study was conducted. Course results of the students (N=82) who took the new version of the course (experimental group) were compared to the results of the students from the control group (N=66). Contribution: An approach for a blended learning course in the field of software engineering was developed. This approach is based on the formative assessment activities that promote collaboration and the use of digital tools. Newly designed activities are used to encourage a greater level of acquired theoretical content and enhance the acquisition of subject-specific skills needed for practical tasks. Findings: The results showed that students who participated in the formative assessment activities achieved significantly better results. They had significantly higher scores in the main components of assessment compared to the students from the control group. In addition, students from the experimental group expressed positive views about the effectiveness of the used approach. Recommendations for Practitioners: The proposed approach has potential to increase students' motivation and academic achievements so practitioners should consider to apply it in their own context. Recommendations for Researchers: Researchers are encouraged to conduct additional studies to explore the effectiveness of the approach with different courses and participants as well as to provide further insights regarding its applicability and acceptance by students. Impact on Society: The paper provides an approach and an example of good practice that may be beneficial for the university teachers in the field of computer science, information-communication technology, and engineering. Future Research: In the future, face-to-face activities will be adapted for performance in an online environment. Future work will also include a research on the possibilities of personalization of activities in accordance with the students' characteristics.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This research aimed to measure the effectiveness of using thinking maps through the Edmodo network to develop achievement and mathematical connections skills among middle school students. Background: One of the most important and major problems in education is reduced levels of academic achievement among students generally and in mathematics specifically. This is having a negative impact on academic outcomes. As mentioned in statement of the problem, several studies have identified weaknesses in academic achievement in mathematics. The results and recommendations of previous studies have referred to the effectiveness of thinking maps in developing numerous variables. Previous studies have identified weaknesses in mathematical connections skills. No Arabic studies have addressed the effectiveness of thinking maps through the Edmodo network in developing achievement and mathematical connections skills among middle school students. Methodology: The participants were a purposive sample of 102 second-year middle school students. These were divided into two groups: experimental (n = 49) and control (n = 53). To achieve the research objectives, the experimental approach in its quasi-experimental design was adopted with (pre-post) measurement for both groups. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Contribution: This study added information to the literature on the effectiveness of the thinking maps strategy through the Edmodo network in developing achievement and mathematical connections skills. Devising a modern teaching strategy to help students solve mathematical problems and thus can be generalized to various fields of life. This also the first study on this subject in Saudi Arabia. Findings: The results showed there was a significant difference between the mean post-test scores of the experimental and control groups on the achievement test in favor of the experimental group. Additionally, there was a significant difference between the mean post-test scores of the experimental and control groups on the mathematical connections skills test in favor of the experimental group. There was also a positive correlation between the development of achievement and mathematical connections skills among middle school students who used thinking maps through the Edmodo network. Recommendations for Practitioners: At a practice level, holding courses and training workshops for middle school mathematics teachers that include training on how to use modern learning models enhanced with technology, including the thinking Maps strategy, in the mathematics curriculum. Preparing guidelines for middle school mathematics teachers on how to use Thinking Maps via the Edmodo Network and how to train students in its use. Recommendation for Researchers: Further research is needed to study the Effectiveness of the Thinking Maps strategy via the Edmodo network on developing achievement and mathematical connections skills in other subjects and at different educational stages. Impact on Society: Our findings encourage teachers and educational supervisors to adopt the use of thinking maps on learning platforms for mathematics teaching as an effective method for developing achievement and mathematical connections skills. Benefiting from the applications and experiences of developed countries who have used e-learning in teaching curricula in order to keep pace with contemporary developments. Future Research: Future studies could be extended to identify the effectiveness of maps of strategic thinking across Edmodo network variables within other subsidiaries, such as mathematical communication, creative thinking, mathematical proof, mind habits, and so on. Assess the effectiveness of play-based learning strategies via the Edmodo network in developing achievement and mathematical connection skills. Conduct a study that measures teachers' and students' attitudes toward using the Thinking Maps strategy via the Edmodo network. Assessing the effectiveness of using the Thinking Maps strategy via an Edmodo network in achieving and developing creative skills among secondary school students.

AB  - Confusion may benefit learning when it is resolved or partially resolved. Metacognitive strategies (MS) may help learners to resolve confusion when it occurs during learning and problem solving. This study examined the relationship between confusion and MS that students evoked in Betty's Brain, a computer-based learning-by-modelling environment where elementary and middle school students learn science by building causal maps. Participants were sixth graders. Emotion data were collected from real-time observations by trained researchers. MS and task performance information were determined by analyzing the action logs. Pre- and post-tests were used to assess learning gains. The results revealed that the use of MS was a function of the state of student confusion. However, confusion resolution was not related to MS behaviour, and MS did not moderate the effect of confusion on student task performance in Betty's Brain or on learning gains.

AB  - The active learning literature has greatly expanded over the past few years. This article investigates the utility of employing concept map activities in a medium-sized class, and whether or not it improves students' learning and retention of material. We find that concept mapping activities significantly enhance students' mastery and recollection of class material. The size of the effect is considerably greater in our treatment group, relative to our control group. We discuss the advantages of this specific active learning technique, and offer suggestions for its incorporation into different institutional settings.

AB  - Purpose: This article presents a case study exploring how future teachers combine scientific knowledge and practical knowledge during a history didactics course and practicum field experience in history teaching in Quebec high schools. Design: Through a thematic analysis of the written assignments submitted during the practicum and conceptual maps designed as part of the didactics course, links between theory and practice are highlighted. Results: Future teachers' referring to different types of knowledge depends on the expectations specified for each written assignment, and shows discourse with little critical distance. However, the concept maps show a more complex representation of teaching practices which can be explained by both the didactics course and the experiential and practical knowledge gained through the practicum. Implications: This composite of experiences puts initial teacher training into perspective along a continuum that requires consolidating university expectations and varying school practices. Closer collaboration is needed between the different actors involved in both theoretical courses and practical training.

AB  - This study aims to determine pre-service teachers' conceptual understanding of black-body radiation. Designed as a qualitative study, it employed a case study design, which is one of the descriptive research methods. The study group consists of 18 pre-service physics teachers enrolled as seniors. An opinion form and a concept map were used as data collection tools. In other words, results were intended to be comparatively examined by using two different qualitative data collection methods. Pre-service teachers' answers were analysed with the help of answer sculptures. At the end of the study, it was determined that while pre-service teachers generally have the correct conceptual structure, they still have some specific gaps in knowledge. It was seen that pre-service teachers have problems with understanding, especially the Wien law and electromagnetic radiation taking place in black-body radiation.

AB  - Concept mapping instructional strategy is one of the innovations in the teaching and learning of science and biology in particular. Previous studies have reported that teachers and students experienced difficulties in the use of concept mapping. Hence, this study investigated the effects of Concept-mapping instructional strategy on senior secondary school students' achievement and retention in biology in Lagos, Nigeria. Quasi-experimental research design was adopted for the study. The population comprised all senior secondary school two biology students. Two intact classes of SS II students were involved in the study. The research instruments used were Biology Achievement Test (BAT) and Concept-Mapping Based Lesson Plan (CMBLP). The reliability of the instruments was 0.75 and 0.82 respectively. Three research questions with corresponding three hypotheses guided the study. Analysis of Co-variance (ANCOVA) statistical tool was used tested the hypotheses at 0.05 level of significance. The results of the study showed that: (i) the experimental group performed better than the control group, that is: concept-mapping affects students' achievement and retention; and (ii) there was no gender influence on students' achievement. Based on results, it recommended among others that teachers should be encouraged to adopt the use of concept-mapping instructional strategy in teaching senior school biology. Also, male students should be encouraged to better their achievement and retention just like their female counterparts.

AB  - The study was conducted in three phases that is testing, using multimedia and observation of the controlled group. Major objective of the research were to assess the implications of software development design on learners and to identify effects of interactive multimedia environment on learning patterns of learners' at graduate level. The researchers followed experimental design of research and selected a group of six learners from social science departments through purposive sampling technique. Researchers observed and interviewed the sampled learners who used LMS software. The analysis was made to find out results of patterns of multimedia interactions. It was found that in controlled environmental situations, the learners effectively learned by using interactive multimedia. Learners' capacity of learning was developed when they were given freedom to use variety of learning strategies. These learning strategies were based on the ability and cognition of individual learner. It was also found that the interface design also facilitated exploration as well as, provided guidance to make choices. Learners used concept maps as an important tool which helped them in their structured learning. The research concluded that capabilities of the learners may be evoked through nodes, internal motivation and use of innovative learning techniques.

AB  - This study examined self-descriptions of high-performing students and other students and compared the descriptions of these two groups. The concept map, with the open-ended question "Who am I?," was completed by 133 high-performing students and 160 other students. The self-descriptions of these students were subdivided into eleven categories. High-performing students reported mainly characteristics and skills, followed by sport. This pattern was reversed for the other students. School or scholastic skills, both positive and negative, were mentioned more often by high-performing students. Other notable differences between those groups and specific age and gender differences are discussed. The insights from this study are relevant for science, because studies concerning self-concept of primary school students are scarce, and for educational practice, because teachers might use concept maps in their classroom.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the impacts of the use of computer-aided argument maps as a tool to promote prospective teachers' critical thinking skills and dispositions. In this regard, qualitative research method was used in the study. The data of the research were collected through semi-structured interviews. Study group consists of 30 senior prospective teachers from three different classes studying science teaching at a university in Turkey in 2017-2018 academic year. At these three classes mentioned, individual and collaborative argument maps were created in addition to the ABI (Argumentation-based inquiry) activities. The study group was formed on a volunteer basis with 10 students from each class who were selected from, their course performances into consideration. A computer software was used to create the argument maps. Data obtained from interviews were analyzed through NVIVO program. The results obtained indicated that critical thinking skill sub-dimensions such as explanation, analysis, interpretation, evaluation, Self-correction and critical thinking disposition sub-dimensions such as questioning the reliability of sources, being open and fair-minded, being respectful of differences were emphasized more in the group in which the prospective teachers performed computer-aided, individual and collaborative mapping rather than the group in which only ABI activities were performed.

AB  - Creative thinking ability can be trained to students during learning process using suitable learning materials. The purpose of this study was to produce a valid and practical student worksheet based on iMindMap in Animalia topic to train students' creative thinking ability. This R & D referred to 4D model (define, design, develop, and disseminate) without disseminate phase. The validity of student worksheets was determined based on experts (material, education and media) assessment. Meanwhile, the practicality was evaluated based on teachers' and students' responses; and the readability of the worksheet decided based on Fry Graph. The data gained were analyzed descriptive-quantitatively. The research results revealed that the worksheet developed was declared as very valid (mode value: 4) and very practical based on practitioners' responses (mode value: 4) and students' responses (the positive responses reached 90.45%). In addition, the readability test result was at level 10, which means that the worksheet was suitable for Grade 10. Hence, it can be concluded that the student worksheet based on iMindMap in Animalia topic can be used to train students' creative thinking ability.

AB  - The aim of the present research was to explore the use of concept maps as an assessment tool. The research question posed was: can concept maps be used to quantitatively assess the learning of a physics topic in an engineering course? This paper describes a new approach to quantifying concept maps. The research was preceded by a pilot project that allowed the necessary processes for the proper conduct of the research to be developed. The sample comprised 47 first-year engineering students who were asked to construct a concept map about the content of electrostatic interactions. The concept maps the students prepared were valued quantitatively and qualitatively by an expert instructor. To validate the approach, an analysis of the relationship between the scores given in the three evaluation forms was made. A comparative statistical analysis of the multiple-choice examination data with the quantitative and the qualitative evaluations of the concept maps found not only that there were no significant differences between them in either case, but also that they were moderately, but significantly, correlated. These results suggest that we are on the right track to obtain an effective and easy-to-use tool to evaluate the students' learning results based on the quantitative assessment of the conceptual maps elaborated by them. Moreover, the analysis of the concept maps in the pilot stage allowed the difficulties that the students had during their learning to be detected, which led to the sequencing of the content of the electrostatic interactions topic being changed.

AB  - As medical schools have changed their curricula to address foundational and clinical sciences in a more integrated fashion, teaching methods such as concept mapping have been incorporated in small group learning settings. Methods that can assess students' ability to apply such integrated knowledge are not as developed, however. The purpose of this project was to assess the validity of scores on a focused version of concept maps called mechanistic case diagrams (MCDs), which are hypothesized to enhance existing tools for assessing integrated knowledge that supports clinical reasoning. The data were from the medical school graduating class of 2018 (N = 136 students). In 2014-2015 we implemented a total of 16 case diagrams in case analysis groups within the Mechanisms of Health and Disease (MOHD) strand of the pre-clinical curriculum. These cases were based on topics being taught during the lectures and small group sessions for MOHD. We created an overall score across all 16 cases for each student. We then correlated these scores with performance in the preclinical curriculum [as assessed by overall performance in MOHD integrated foundational basic science courses and overall performance in the Clinical and Professional Skills (CAPS) courses], and standardized licensing exam scores [United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)] Step 1 (following core clerkships) and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (at the beginning of the fourth year of medical school). MCD scores correlated with students' overall basic science scores (r = 0.46, p = 0.0002) and their overall performance in Clinical and Professional Skills courses (r = 0.49, p < 0.0001). In addition, they correlated significantly with standardized exam measures, including USMLE Step 1 (r = 0.33, p [less than or equal to] 0.0001), and USMLE Step 2 CK (r = 0.39, p < 0.0001). These results provide preliminary validity evidence that MCDs may be useful in identifying students who have difficulty in integrating foundational and clinical sciences.

AB  - Concept maps were created as one of six measures to identify exceptionally talented students during the Cultivating Diverse Talent in STEM (CDTIS) project, with the goal of identifying and nurturing talents in students from groups traditionally underrepresented in special programs. New methods were compared with conventional methods to select students for an internship in the laboratories of scientists. In this article, we describe development, field testing, and implementation of the concept map assessments in life and physical science. Assessments were field tested in partner schools with high percentages of American Indian (97% to 100%) and Hispanic (83%) low-income students. Students were selected by considering their performance on all six assessments and were placed in internships along with students selected using conventional methods. Concept maps were successful: (a) students from partner schools demonstrated high levels of domain-relevant skills; (b) scores approximated a normal distribution; (c) scores of students from culturally diverse, low-income groups were very similar to the scores of students selected using conventional methods even though many of conventionally identified students had high grade point averages and came from schools in high-income areas with many educational opportunities. Students completed original research and presented posters to the university community and their local communities. Concept maps can be used alone or in combination with other assessments; their use needs to be studied with larger groups of students and in other contexts.

AB  - A research team consisting of educators of gifted students, a scientist, and experts in measurement developed a performance-based assessment of life science skills and abilities. Four high schools in the Southwestern United States were the settings for field testing and implementation. Five levels of ratings were given: "unknown," "maybe," "probably," "definitely," and "wow." The majority of student scores were in the maybe and probably categories. Using six new measures (concept maps in life and physical science, math problem solving, spatial analytical performance assessment, life science performance assessment and physical science performance assessment), 23 students (M2) were selected for participation in science laboratories at an R1 university along with 20 students (M1) selected by conventional means. When the nine attribute scores of the performance-based assessment were compared, no significant difference was found t(41), p > 0.38, between M1 and M2 students. Performance-based assessments in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will provide an alternative and a complement to standard achievement tests. They have the potential to identify and nurture exceptionally talented high school students across all demographic groups.

AB  - In the Cultivating Diverse Talent in STEM project, funded by the National Science Foundation in the United States, new assessments were developed, field tested, used to identify students with exceptional talent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and compared with existing methods (grade point average [GPA], letters of recommendation, self-statements). Students identified by both methods participated in an internship program in laboratories of scientists on the campus of an R1 university in the Southwest. Existing methods limited the diversity of students identified. Significant differences were found between students identified by the new methods (M2) and existing methods (M1) in GPA, ethnicity, and parent level of education. Ethnicity differences may be due to the ethnic makeup of the partner schools, but differences in GPA and parent level of education cannot be attributed to the location of schools. Although GPAs of M1 students were significantly higher (3.71) than those of M2 students (3.07) and M1 students came from higher income groups and schools in higher income areas, the M2 students scored higher on all the performance assessments of creative problem-solving and at similar levels on concept maps and mathematical problem-solving. Studies of the usefulness and psychometric properties of the new assessments are needed with different groups and in different contexts.

AB  - Science educators have developed a variety of assessment techniques to help students connect their scientific knowledge and bridge conceptual gaps. In chemistry, concept maps and creative exercises are the two notable assessments that have been implemented into multiple chemistry courses and indicated promising effects on students' conceptual learning and connection-making between chemistry concepts. These two assessment techniques were usually implemented individually in research studies. Herein, we employed a quasi-experimental, mixed-methods approach to explore whether combining concept maps and creative exercises would reveal any synergistic effects for student learning of chemical equilibrium and acid-base chemistry in a college general chemistry course. In this study, student perceptions of the use of the two assessments were examined by open-ended surveys. Interestingly, students perceived creative exercises as an assessment technique while concept maps were viewed as a learning tool for studying or reviewing exams. Additionally, Students believed that concept maps assisted them in answering creative exercises, but not vice versa. The four study groups (control group, concept maps only, creative exercises only, and both concept maps and creative exercises) were compared through concept inventory pre and post-test questions. The results of an ANCOVA indicated that participation in the experimental groups did not significantly impact conceptual learning gains, as measured by the concept inventory post-test scores. However, focus group interviews indicated students from the experimental group that used both concept maps and creative exercises were able to provide more sophisticated scientific explanations for conceptual questions related to the topics of chemical equilibrium and acid-base chemistry. Implications of these research results, best practices for implementation of the two assessments, and future research are discussed.

AB  - This article is the result of a critical analysis of the incorporation of Digital Culture into methodologies and interactive approaches that drive collaborative and meaningful learning processes for higher education students. We will analyze a specific course, Science, Technology and Society in Arts, Languages and Culture, with students from the 1st. Semester of the Portuguese Language and Literature for Teacher education Course of a Private University. Our goal is to demonstrate the planning, implementation, and learning outcome in a course with a hybrid methodological approach that makes use of interactive tools in the students' learning trail. We will highlight an interactive evaluative activity that consisted in the construction of a collaborative mural using the "Digital Padlet" tool as a resource for a critical reflection done by students on the chapter of a book from the basic bibliography: "What is Society?" (Bazzo, 2003). We adopted the qualitative analysis of the data from the Collaborative mural itself and the records of the students' Digital Learning Diaries, which was performed after the collaborative activity. This allowed us to observe the relationships between the methodological approach, the use of digital tools and the perception of significant learning in higher education, as well as to establish a critical reflection on the incorporation of digital culture in pedagogical practices.

AB  - Concept maps make connections between ideas apparent, and thus would seem ideally suited to demonstrate learning. Yet, they are not widely used by instructors, particularly in large university classes. In this paper we review the strengths and rationale behind concept maps and provide examples we have used to structure content for one of our introductory courses. A rubric that focuses on propositions was used to grade student-created concept maps on a final exam administered to 293 students. These grades are compared to those of multiple-choice questions, short answers, and an essay on the same exam. We find poor correlation between concept maps and the other instruments, and stronger correlations between short answers and multiple choice, as well as between short-answer content grades and essay writing grades. We speculate that concept maps may be less influenced by student language skills and short-term memory than written answers, and that concept maps should be used as an alternative assessment of higher order thinking skills.

AB  - Learning science is important for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as knowledge of science allows students to understand their natural world, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is increasingly emphasized in schools. Reading to learn science is, therefore, a vital skill in today's schools for all students. Using a single-case reversal design, this study evaluated the effectiveness of Reading to Engage Children with Autism in Language and Literacy (RECALL; a shared reading intervention) combined with a concept map on the ability of young children with ASD to answer comprehension questions from science text. Two 5-year-old boys with ASD participated in this study. Results indicated that RECALL combined with a concept map was effective in increasing participants' correct responding to comprehension questions from science text. Implications for intervention and research are discussed.

AB  - Concept mapping, a tool originally developed to facilitate student learning by organizing and visualizing key concepts and their relationships, can also be used to represent the composition of the knowledge contained in a course. In this paper, the authors describe a specific application of concept mapping to help instructors and students visualize the knowledge contained in an introductory programming course of an undergraduate Computer Information Systems program. The authors show how representing the knowledge structure of a course using a concept map can enable the faculty to assess the breadth and depth of the knowledge imparted through the course. The authors discuss how a concept map that depicts the composition of a course can function as a useful instructional tool to assess and improve the quality of instruction that may enable meaningful learning among students.

AB  - The American Chemical Society, Division of Chemical Education, Examinations Institute has been developing content maps for the undergraduate program based on subdiscipline specifications since 2008. The Anchoring Concepts Content Maps (or ACCM) have been published in four subdisciplines (general, organic, physical, and inorganic chemistry) with the latest work presented here in a fifth subdiscipline: analytical chemistry. As with the development of the other maps, an alignment process of identifying key components of exam items including content, complexity, and other item characteristics was conducted with both analytical chemistry and instrumental analysis items. The results of the alignments as well as an evaluation of the newest ACCM in relation to the other published maps are presented.

AB  - "Didn't understand or not fully understand" is the most common situation that students experience when they learn medical biochemistry and molecular biology (MBMB). Therefore, the primary task of teaching MBMB is to help students overcome the difficulties in "conceptual understanding." The core of the solution to these problems lies in the acquisition and application of cognitive skills. The key to applying Ausubel cognitive assimilation theory (A's CAT) is to expand the knowledge capacity of students' cognitive structure through the purposeful "production" and employment of advanced organizers, with which students can replace "rote learning" with "meaningful learning" and ultimately develop an interest in MBMB courses. The results showed that the application of A's CAT did not only encourage the students to use cognitive skills to learn and understand MBMB knowledge and overcome the barrier to learning that results from the characteristics of the MBMB course, but also expanded and deepened the MBMB course contents. As a branch of learning theory, A's CAT provides practical methods for the several hypotheses of learning theory. Among these, the advanced organizer strategy realizes the organization and reorganization of new knowledge; the progressive differentiation strategy reduces the difficulty of complex and abstract knowledge; the implementation of the advanced organizer strategy and integrative reconciliation strategy forms the concept map. Taken together, the application of A's CAT includes cognitive strategy and metacognitive strategy when the cognitive process is conducted in a meaningful way. More importantly, application of A's CAT guides students to participate in active learning and builds "scaffolding" for the teaching/learning MBMB of student-centered goals.

AB  - Creativity has become an increasingly important competence in today's rapidly changing times. It is a central aspect of social development, but it is hardly discussed in schools and often neglected in the natural sciences. In order to promote creativity in science teaching in a targeted way, it is important to understand the perspectives and views of prospective teachers on this topic. For this purpose, a qualitative cross-sectional study was conducted with 83 German chemistry student teachers at the beginning and at the end of their study programme. We used concept maps and questionnaires to characterize changes in students' perspective on creativity in the chemistry classroom during their course of study. The quantitative analysis of the concept maps and the content analysis of student's proposition revealed similarities and differences in students' perspective on creativity between beginners and advanced student. All student teachers showed a diverse range of conceptions and views on creativity in general and in the context of chemistry education. Furthermore, almost all of the students had a positive attitude towards creativity and its integration in chemistry lessons. Although, there are no large differences in the perspective on creativity from beginner to advanced student teachers, subtle differences in students' perspectives revealed that advanced students had a more sophisticated perspective on fostering creativity in students in their prospective classrooms.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to design and develop a theory-based summary writing online tool, named Summary Writing-Pal (SW-PAL), to assist English as a second language students in improving their summary writing. It also evaluates the effectiveness of SW-PAL in enhancing the students' summary writing performance and examines their perceptions about it. This mixed-method empirical study involved 53 English as a second language students majoring in computer science at a local university. Two intact groups were randomly chosen as the control and experimental groups with 26 and 27 students, respectively. The control group was taught using the conventional method, while the experimental group was taught using SW-PAL. Both groups were given a pre- and post-summary writing test. A Split-Plot Analysis of Covariance test was used to examine the effectiveness of the SW-PAL tool. A focus group interview was conducted to gather qualitative data on perceptions about the SW-PAL tool. Quantitative findings revealed that students' summary writing performance improved significantly due to the SW-PAL with a large effect size of 0.42. Qualitativewise, the users perceived SW-PAL to be useful as a motivating, challenging, and self-learning tool. Recommendations for practice for language instructors who wish to incorporate such a tool into their language instruction and suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Information and knowledge of science are very necessary and vital inputs for growth and survival in modern times. Science is a body of knowledge that can be rationally interpreted and applied consistently in human endeavors. Science as a form of information is a way to examine a process and a way of thinking in the quest for an understanding of nature. The aim of this study is to review teachers' strategies of teaching science. Innovative practices are devices that empower both the students and tutors. The interests of the learners are fulfilled through investing in creative activities as it reflects the students ' desire for learning in doing so. To educators, new approaches are exciting, as they help teachers in involving students in realistic inquiry learning. The authors reviewed articles on innovative teaching strategies. It was concluded from the survey that Innovative teaching strategies are activity-based and characterized by students sharing some degree of responsibility for making decision in the learning process.

AB  - The main purpose of this research is to determine the effect of the volume of concept on the level of understanding the relationship between concepts. The mixed method was used in the research. Volume of concept form, concept map form and puzzle scales were used to collect quantitative data. Qualitative data was collected through a fully structured interview form. A homogeneous sample was used in the study. A total of 54 students participated in the study (there are 27 students in both experimental and control groups). The data was analyzed with the help of SPSS and Microsoft Excel program. T-test, Wilcoxon, frequency and percentage techniques were used for descriptive analysis. According to the findings, it was determined that volume of concept had a positive effect on relationship between concepts. No significant relationship was found between the experimental and control groups in regards to concept knowledge. In addition, according to the quantitative findings, concept map was found to be more successful in determining the relationships between concepts. On the other hand, according to the qualitative findings, the volume of concept form and concept map was equally effective in determining the relationship amongst different concepts. In line with the results, volume of concept can be used to determine the relationship between concepts.

AB  - As an instructional tool, models can transform the student experience from the static to the dynamic, the flat to the 3D, and the siloed to the integrated. Few practical resources exist to help instructors transition toward model-based classroom practices. The "Modeling in the Classroom" evidence-based teaching guide provides instructors with a tool kit for incorporating models and modeling into their classrooms (https://lse.ascb.org/evidence-based-teaching-guides/modeling-in-the-classroom). The guide discusses the underpinnings of modeling as a core scientific practice, one that can enable student development of systems thinking skills and understanding of biological concepts. The guide describes a variety of model types, including phylogenetic trees, simulations, animations, diagrams, conceptual models, concept maps, and tactile models supported by summaries of and links to articles and resources. In this paper, we will introduce key findings describing why and how to use models in the classroom. We also describe open research questions needed to address classroom implementation, instructional design, and development of students' knowledge and skills. It is our hope that the guide will provide a suitable combination of research-based findings and practical suggestions that instructors will be supported and encouraged to thoughtfully incorporate modeling to support learning goals.

AB  - Describes the exploratory assessment of strategy for learning redox reactions in High School, which seeks to prevent students from developing memoristic and mechanical skills, in addition to emphasize the experiences of daily life that go unnoticed or unexplained to the student in the classroom and at the same time are able to incorporate the key elements for understanding the terminology used in the language of Chemistry, all through proposal for a strategy. The sample consisted of sophomores from CBT High School No. 2 Bicentennial Huehuetoca in Mexico. The students are in the subject of Chemistry I. The didactic sequence was appropriate, for the learning of redox reactions, since it managed to increase by 41.9% the conceptual gain in the students.

AB  - The American Chemical Society (ACS), Division of Chemical Education, Examinations Institute, has been developing content maps to describe comprehensively the undergraduate curriculum aligned to traditional subdisciplines. These content maps have been developed through the combined efforts of many faculty members who teach the targeted courses in the subdiscipline. A recent collaboration between the Examinations Institute and the ACS Green Chemistry Institute has resulted in the consideration of green chemistry content in the context of the content maps. The inclusion of green chemistry concepts in the context of organic chemistry has been the initial focus of the work of this collaboration. Through working with faculty who teach green chemistry courses or organic chemistry courses with the theme of green chemistry, the organic chemistry content map has been revised and reconceptualized with the theme of green chemistry included. The process, excerpts of the content map, and alignments of traditional organic chemistry exam items to both the organic chemistry content map and the organic chemistry content map with the inclusion of green chemistry are reported.

AB  - The first PhD thesis in the field of Chemistry Education at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad, was defended in 1992. This can be regarded as the symbolic dawn of Chemistry Education as a scientific discipline in this region. After the official breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, research that had started in the 1980s, and which was focused on the development of tools for assessing the quality and flexibility of student knowledge, was continued through the 1990s. This research included the application of computers to chemistry teaching, as well as the development of appropriate chemistry learning programmes. In the following period, research focused on the analysis of chemical teaching programmes in the Republic of Serbia, with a special emphasis on the possibility of including eco-chemical content in curricula. Accordingly, potentially efficient models were suggested. The most recent research has been focused on the investigation of the effectiveness of instructional strategies based on a systemic approach and a triplet model of content representation, using combined measures of students' performance and mental effort. In this regard, tools for the efficient assessment of knowledge (systemic synthesis questions, context-based questions) have been developed along with tools for the efficient assessment of students' misconceptions (multi-tier tests). Furthermore, in order to make teaching more effective, procedures for assessing the cognitive complexity of chemical problems have recently been developed and subsequently validated both statistically and by applying Knowledge Space Theory.

AB  - The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the Remap RT (Reading -- Concept Mapping -- Reciprocal Teaching) learning model on low-ability students' achievement in biology. This quasi-experimental research made use of a pre-test-post-test non-equivalent control group design. The population of this research was 125 tenth-grade students from the Natural Science classes aged around 16 years old. Four classes were randomly selected as the samples, and they were divided into two groups: two classes belonged to the high ability classes, and the other two were categorised into the low ability groups. The students' achievement was measured using an essay test. The results of the test were analysed using ANCOVA. The findings indicated that: (1) students who learned using Remap RT had better academic achievement in biology than students who learned using a conventional method; (2) students with high academic ability had better academic achievement than students with low academic achievement; and (3) low-ability students who learned using Remap RT and high-ability students who learned using a conventional method had equal academic achievement. The results of the research suggest that Remap RT was effective in improving low-ability students' achievement in biology.

AB  - In an effort to improve student conceptual understanding and help students better connect pre-existing knowledge to new ideas, a concept map assignment was implemented in a first-year college level general chemistry course. This implementation included a quasi-experiment that was carried out in discussion group recitation sections within a third-quarter general chemistry course. Students enrolled in a single section of the course were divided into two groups in which a concept map treatment was compared to a control group that completed short journal entries. Comparison of a concept inventory post-test using an independent samples t-test indicates students in the concept map treatment appear to perform better than the students in the journal control group (t = 2.34, mean difference = 0.844, p < 0.05). However, a multi-variable regression analysis in which the concept inventory post-test scores were compared between the treatment and control groups, while traits related to incoming academic preparation were held constant, suggests there was no significant difference in performance (unstandardized b = 0.222, p = 0.540). The quality of the students' concept maps was also evaluated and correlated to student performance on the concept inventory, and it appears students who were better at concept mapping made greater gains in conceptual understanding (Pearson's r = 0.295, p < 0.05). When the relationship between the quality of concept mapping and concept inventory post-test was determined while holding constant covariates related to incoming academic preparation, the unstandardized B coefficient was positive, but was not significant at the p = 0.05 level (unstandardized b = 0.215, p = 0.134) This study does not provide unequivocal evidence that a concept map treatment leads to greater gains in conceptual understanding compared to a control population, or that students with better concept mapping skills performed better on the concept inventory instrument. Nevertheless, a template for implementing a concept map assignment in a large enrollment course is provided, and the results presented herein might prompt chemistry instructors to consider including concept map assignments in their instructional toolbox.

AB  - This study aims to analyse the potentialities of using Personal Meaning Maps to assess school children's learning in a visit to a Planetarium. A total of 123 primary students were involved. They were asked to create a PMM, and a drawing, before and after the visit. The results suggest that the visit enhanced the degree to which students generate words and conceptual categories to describe their understanding of the suggested concepts. PMMs seemed to be a good tool to evaluate the impact of the activities on students' ideas about the thematic explored. Drawings helped to understand the main misconceptions.

AB  - Conceptual change theories assume that knowledge structures grow during the learning process but also get reorganized. Yet, this reorganization process itself is hard to examine. By using concept maps, we examined the changes in students' knowledge structures and linked it to conceptual change theory. In a longitudinal study, thirty high-achieving students (M = 14.41 years) drew concept maps at three timepoints across a teaching unit on magnetism and electrostatics. In total, 87 concept maps were analyzed using betweenness and PageRank centrality as well as a clustering algorithm. We also compared the students' concept maps to four expert maps on the topic. Besides a growth of the knowledge network, the results indicated a reorganization, with first a fragmentation during the unit, followed by an integration of knowledge at the end of the unit. Thus, our analysis revealed that the process of conceptual change on this topic was non-linear. Moreover, the terms used in the concept maps varied in their centrality, with more abstract terms being more central and thus more important for the structure of the map. We also suggest ideas for the usage of concept maps in class.

AB  - This conceptual paper offers a reconsideration of the application of Novakian concept mapping to higher education research by putting to work the Deleuzian concept of the rhizome. We ask: what does thinking with Deleuze's concepts offer researchers interested in concept mapping, and what conceptual, and terminological, obstacles might be created through such a reconceptualization? We have focused on the rhizomatic principles of mapping and tracing in the context of concept mapping. We contend that Deleuze offers a fresh line of flight with the potential to deterritorialise the discourse surrounding concept mapping, thus widening its applicability and increasing its accessibility to researchers who do not necessarily share the same arborescent concept mapping heritage: with its roots in science education. Exploring the overlap between rhizomatics and concept mapping also allows for the reappraisal and blurring of the boundary between structural and post-structural discourses--breaking down an unproductive binary in the literature.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 resulted in the worldwide disruption of teaching and learning in main stream schools and in institutes of higher learning. Singapore was not spared. With the closure of schools in early April, it was imminent that the delivery and assessment of our freshman general chemistry course must be overhauled for the new semester. While the delivery of Home-based Learning (HBL) was a challenge for all educators, it was a mammoth roadblock for chemistry courses because of laboratory classes. Besides being thrusted to learn and use new technology tools for online lessons, instructors also had to quickly explore and design alternative assessments to substitute in-person written examinations and tests. This paper documents the struggles that played out in the decision to implement concept map assessments and "split-half" laboratory classes for safe distancing. Although these interventions are not novel, we confronted tensions as we sought to address academic integrity, administrative guidelines, and our own inadequacy particularly in concept map assessments. In light of positive and negative feedback from both staff and students, lessons were drawn to enhance future implementation and for further research.

AB  - Classroom assessment and the use of student performance data to inform instructional decisions have significant potential to help students meet the learning goals of science education. Research has shown that process-oriented assessment practices are challenging and sometimes ignored aspects of teaching, partly because teachers' conceptions of assessment practice do not reflect a cycle of assessment that continually informs instruction. This study explores middle school science teachers' conceptions of assessment practice based on drawn conceptual models and interviews that were gathered as part of a year-long professional development intervention. Results indicate that participants initially conceived of assessment practice in terms of tangible elements. Changes were seen, however, across the PD as several teachers developed conceptions that were more iterative, in which frequent assessment was used to inform future instruction. These findings raise important questions for how PD can most effectively support teachers' adoption of research-based conceptions of quality science assessment practices.

AB  - Background: One approach to enhancing the pedagogy of science education is to employ academics who are not only science-trained but also engaged in education research. As some academics begin their Scholarship of Teaching and Learning research careers with a pure science background, shifting in disciplinary perspectives can be a source of professional tension. The pedagogic frailty model provides a framework that helps us to integrate institutional efforts to enhance teaching improvements by maintaining a simultaneous focus on critical areas that are thought to impede academic development. Purpose: This paper draws attention to the importance of disciplinary crossover by uncovering and comparing academics' teaching perspectives, views and beliefs from three disciplines: natural science (chemistry), social science (education) and science education. Method: Through a case study design using the pedagogic frailty model and concept map-mediated interviews as a tool, three academics engaged in a non-linear discourse in which their conceptions could be visualised and analysed. Findings and Discussion: Analysis of the case study interviews indicated that the academics' conceptions of teaching were highly individualised. The discourse surrounding the curriculum, and the embeddedness of and connection between pedagogy and discipline, were both subject-sensitive and influenced by professional backgrounds and research areas. On the other hand, because they operated under the same institutional values and regulations, we found a considerable overlap in terms of how the academics perceived the tensions between research and teaching and academic leadership. By comparing three academics who were at a different stage in the journey from disciplinary experts (chemistry) to teaching expert (education), we were able to uncover and understand more about the ways that the teaching environment impacted upon their practices. The science educator shared aspects of the other two perspectives, which suggests that his profile was a transitory state in comparison with the chemist and the educationist. Conclusion: The findings provide a glimpse of the distinctive nature of the values that underpin teaching and offer insights that can be used to promote dialogue about quality enhancement in science education.

AB  - The approaches of "problem-based learning" and "writing to learn" are known for facilitating the apprehension of concepts and better retaining of knowledge. In educational research, concept maps are sometimes used to assess the learners' level of knowledge. In this paper, the main aim is to investigate the validity of concept maps as an instrument for the assessment of learning. Therefore, six students were observed for more than a year and their learning process was documented in various ways. The concept maps were used in the form of a pre-post-test, and the different students' results were compared in a cross-case analysis using a master concept map. The results presented in this study indicate that the validity of concept maps compared to interviews and reports are questionable. It is possible to measure some parts of the learning process with concept maps, but conceptual learning seems to be hidden from the instrument. Therefore, concept maps might not be the most useful tool to measure conceptual change.

AB  - Concept mapping helps learners to understand complex ideas. However, studies confirming that statement are scarce. A quasi-experimental and Design-based approaches were applied to understand the effectiveness of concept mapping based teaching method on grade eight students' conceptual understanding of photosynthesis. Two sections of grade eight consisting of 103 students were selected randomly. Pretest results were used to assign students as experimental and control groups and treated with concept mapping and lecture methods, respectively. The post-test results of the two study groups revealed a statistically significant difference indicated that students' treated with concept mapping method exhibited better conceptual understanding on the concept of photosynthesis than those treated with lecture method. This study suggests that science teachers should apply concept mapping method to teach science concepts systematically. The use of concept mapping method in science classes can help students to better understand the important concepts.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to determine the conceptual understanding (The Unit of Force) levels of seventh-grade students with different cognitive styles with different measurement techniques and to observe how the conceptual understanding levels measured by different measurement techniques are affected by their cognitive styles. Research Method: The sample of the study, which was a causal-comparative study, consisted of 80 seventh-grade students in a public school in Ankara. To determine the field-dependent/field-- independent cognitive style differences of the students, the Group Embedded Figures Test was used. To determine students' conceptual understanding levels two different measurement techniques were used together. The first of these was the Life Based Concept Test. The test consisted of multiple-choice questions using real-life contexts that the student was familiar with in everyday life. Force Concept Map was another measurement technique used to determine students' conceptual understanding. The data obtained were analyzed with MANOVA, one-way ANOVA and t-tests. Findings: The findings of this research show that there was a significant difference concerning conceptual understanding levels measured by Life Based Concept Test and Force Concept Map in favor of students with field-independent cognitive style. The results obtained in this context revealed that the conceptual understanding levels measured by different measurement techniques in the unit of force differ according to cognitive styles of the students. Implications for Research and Practice: This study points out that cognitive style differences are an effective factor in student success. This difference in student achievement shows that measurement techniques may lead to a disadvantage/advantage for the student. Therefore, it is recommended to review the studies in which the conceptual understanding is measured by uniform tests in the literature. In addition, researchers are recommended to use multiple measurement techniques that consider students' individual differences to obtain more valid results.

AB  - Prior research on the significance of roles in collaborative learning has explored their impact when they are pre-assigned to group members. In this article, it is argued that focusing on assigned roles downplays the spontaneous, emergent, and interactional nature of roles in small task groups and that this focus has limited the development of generalizable frameworks aimed at understanding the impact of roles in and across collaborative learning settings. A case is built for the importance of focusing on the functional participatory roles enacted during collaborative learning and for conceptualising these roles as emergent, dynamic, and evolving in situ (first claim). Further, a flexible conceptual framework for the analysis and understanding of such roles across diverse collaborative science-learning activities is proposed, based on the assumption that during collaborative learning, both core and activity-specific roles are enacted (second claim). The core roles resemble each other across activities as they associate closely with the nature of the science discipline itself, whereas the activity-specific roles vary across activities as their emergence is dependent on the affordances, demands, and characteristics of the particular activity and environment. Data from three diverse science-learning environments, including four totally or partly student-led collaborative science activities, were scrutinized to establish the degree of empirical support for this assumption and, thereby, the conceptual usefulness of the proposed framework. The contributions of the framework for future research of collaborative science learning are discussed.

AB  - With the developing technology educating students free from misconceptions, making sense of their learnings and using them in daily life are primarily aimed. This research is designed not only for teaching "work, energy and power" concepts and the relationships among them but also for investigating the effects of the teaching on students' achievements under the POE method. 6 students from the 9th grade studying at a private Anatolian High School chosen through easily accessible case sampling method, constituted the sample. 4 data collection tools (semi-structured interview, open-ended achievement test, concept map and concept cartoon) were applied. It was carried out within the scope of a single group pretest-posttest simple experimental study, a quantitative research method. For analyising the data, gap and content analysis methods were used. Thanks to the interviews, open-ended achievement test and concept map, as pre-tests, it was determined that students had many misconceptions about "work, energy, power" concepts and didn't have any scientific knowledge about the relationships among them. The students' drawings on these relationships were also far from scientific. After the concept teaching under POE was performed, the data collection tools were re-applied as post-tests. So, it was seen that students' misconceptions were largely eliminated by replacing them with scientifically-correct concepts and relationships as a result of that process. In the light of these findings, applying POE method in concept teaching on different classes, courses or subjects is highly recommended. Some suggestions are also made for the researchers wishing to work in this field.

AB  - There is a close relationship between chemistry and physics in the context of atomic structure, which is usually covered in both courses at the secondary-school level. However, little emphasis has been put on determining whether the students developed correct understanding of the quantum structure when they studied it in both the courses. The purpose of this study was to reveal -- by using the concept mapping tool -- the cognitive structures used by twelfth-grade students to understand atomic structure. One hundred forty-five students from three secondary schools in Ankara, Turkey participated in the study. The qualitative content analysis technique was employed to analyse concepts, levels of connection, and linking phrases in students' concept maps drawn for the atom. The analysis results revealed that the students had a limited understanding of the quantum structure of the atom, even after studying the topic in chemistry and physics courses. They relied on classical ideas to understand atomic structure. The results suggest that concepts related to atomic structure should be appropriately used not only within a particular subject (e.g. physics) but also across the two subjects to help students understand the scientifically correct atomic structure. Further, several other implications for secondary-school science teaching are discussed.

AB  - During the university term, in addition to graduation, some Brazilian science undergraduate students have the opportunity to join Scientific Initiation Programs (SI). Students are expected to be able to develop scientific writing skills. Based on these goals, this descriptive study aimed to investigate the efficacy of practical activities for SI students on the topic of the structure of scientific articles, using a qualitative approach via a case study. Five female students, who were aged between 20 and 30 years and enrolled in a Food Engineering undergraduate course, participated in the study. The students attended two meetings. In the first, texts that dealt with the structure of scientific articles were distributed, followed by a scientific bingo game. The second meeting focused on the creation of concept maps. The activity methodologies used allowed the SI students to remember their previous knowledge about the subject and generate new knowledge. The association between the two activities provided a better understanding of the subject. It was concluded that educators should seek new ways to introduce the understanding of topics that are part of the student's daily life and that practical activities usually generate a positive result because they are dynamic, interactive, and undertaken in groups.

AB  - The learning of Indonesian for foreign speakers (bahasa Indonesia untuk penutur asing/BIPA) develops very fast. One of them is the People's Republic of China (PRC). In line with this, the government of PRC shows a serious intention to learn Indonesian language by sending their students to learn the Indonesian language in Indonesia through BIPA program. The success of BIPA learning depends on the learners' first language and teaching materials used. Therefore, in-depth studies on the linguistic characteristics of the BIPA learners are necessary to be conducted to acquire suitable teaching materials following the learners' needs. This research was conducted on eight students of BIPA for academic purposes program from China. This research was conducted by applying a qualitative descriptive approach. The findings on the linguistic characteristics of the BIPA students from China show three aspects. First, from the aspect of phonology, Chinese students do not really master the consonant sound pronunciation of Indonesian language, which is apparent from the inability and consistent mispronunciation in pronouncing certain sounds. Second, from the aspect of morphology, the students can construct words with some affixes that form the active form, but can't construct word using affixes that form the passive form. Third, the students have been able to construct a simple and complex sentence with two clauses, yet, they face difficulties in changing an active sentence to passive and vice versa. The three findings were then used to map the BIPA teaching materials, which later will be used for Chinese students in the future. [For the full proceedings, see ED626375.]

AB  - The aim of present research was to examine the effects of interdisciplinary teaching approach on teaching the topic of proteins. In the research, unequal control group model- one of the quasi-experimental research designs was used. The experimental group included 16 students (8 female and 8 male) whereas the control group included 14 students (6 female and 8 male) in this research- which was conducted with the participation of the 12th grade students. A lesson plan in which the topic of proteins was taught in interdisciplinary approach was prepared as the tool of application. A concept map prepared by the researcher and a 5-point Likert type of question were used in collected the data. The data collection tool was given to both the experimental group and the control group as a pre-test and post-test. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, a non-parametric method- was used in comparing the participants' scores in the pre-test and post-test of concept map and Likert type question. As a result, it was found that the application of interdisciplinary teaching conducted in the experimental group had caused differences in students' associating the concepts in biology and chemistry available in the topic of proteins and in their perceptions of their skills in this respect.

AB  - The detailed analysis and scoring of concept maps may not be necessary in order for students to gain from their use in the classroom. A simplified recognition of different types ('species') of map may increase the likelihood of teachers employing maps in their classrooms so that more teachers and students might benefit from concept mapping on a regular basis. A greater familiarity and level of engagement with concept maps is likely to support an increase in the level of mapping expertise developed by both teachers and students, enabling maps to be used to support higher order thinking skills -- as intended. The counter-intuitive conclusion to this prospect is that the adoption of a non-analytical consideration of maps may actually make them a more valuable classroom asset. However, this requires a greater level of expertise in the application of concept maps on the part of the teacher. A simplified typology of 'map species' is presented to support the development of this perspective.

AB  - Meaningful learning occurs by relating new information to and revising prior knowledge, making it essential to understand student knowledge before helping them move toward a more scientific understanding. In this study, we characterise prior knowledge about cellular respiration in undergraduate students enrolled in introductory biology by analysing student-constructed concept maps (N = 182) and interviews (N = 9). Students were instructed to create concept maps from a bank of 20 concepts with the purpose of interconnecting the processes of cellular respiration, showing how pools of ATP are generated and used, and identifying where the events of cellular respiration occur. Student maps were analysed for content, quality and organisation of knowledge. Interviews were used to corroborate inferences made from concept maps. Students had a simplified understanding of cellular respiration and its processes as evident by cognitive structures with limited quantities of schemas that were vaguely connected and linearly organised. Furthermore, students had a better understanding of glycolysis than fermentation. Instructors can use these findings to help students build better knowledge of cellular respiration by focusing on incorporating relevant schemas, creating quality connections among schemas, and organising their knowledge of cellular respiration to reflect biological complexity.

AB  - Two common goals of science teacher professional development (PD) are increased content knowledge (CK) and improved readiness to teach through inquiry. However, PD assessment challenges arise when the context is structured around inquiry-based, participant-driven learning, and when the content crosses scientific disciplines. This study extended the use of concept mapping as an assessment tool for examining changes in the content knowledge of 21 high school science teachers who participated in a field-based environmental science summer institute. The scoring rubric focused on documenting concepts, links, and map organization and scope in an attempt to capture development of cross-disciplinary knowledge in ways that correspond with theories of expertise development. The analysis revealed significant gains from pre-PD to post PD maps in the sophistication of links between concepts and in the number of additional, participant-generated scientifically valid concepts. Relative to the initial maps, post PD maps also manifested more complete clustering of concepts. Findings are discussed in reference to previous studies on teachers' learning and implications for future research using concept mapping as a means of assessing teacher PD.

AB  - Mind maps that contain visual and verbal elements can be thought of as an effective graphical tool that can be used to reveal the existing knowledge, opinions and perceptions of individuals about a concept through mental association. In this study, the aim was to determine the mental models of middle school students related to science by using mind maps in terms of their gender and grade levels. 104 middle school students who were studying at different grade levels participated in the study. The study takes the form of a case study supported by qualitative data. First of all, students were given training on how to make mind maps, and sample implementations were carried out. Later, students were asked to prepare a mind map about the concept of science. Students' mind maps were first scored by experts by taking into consideration the evaluation criteria with regard to mind maps. In the data analysis process, each mind map was examined by using a descriptive analysis technique, while the frequency and percent values of the most common expressions were calculated. The results of the analyses revealed that the students' mind maps scores did not differ significantly in terms of their gender. It was concluded that the fifth grade students' mind map scores were significantly lower than those of other grade students. Thematic analyses showed that students mostly associate science with technology, and offer more examples of natural sciences in mind maps.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to use science mapping to explore the knowledge base on workplace learning. Design/methodology/approach: The analyses were based on the 100 most-cited articles out of the 7,469 results that were generated by the search on SCOPUS database. Bibliometric analyses such as keyword occurrence, co-authorship network and bibliometric coupling network were conducted using VOSviewer. Findings: The results indicated that scholarly work in the area of workplace learning is on the rise while emphasising the need for contributions from Eastern and Asian perspectives. It was also found that scholarly work on workplace learning can be classified into two major schools of thought, namely, one that revolves around learning communities and other around communities of practice. Finally, analysis of the top-journals revealed that many of them have a close association with the field of education. Research limitations/implications: This analysis is based on a single database. Nonetheless, scholars looking forward to research and publish on the topic may consider the key concepts and journals identified in this review. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, no other study on bibliometric analysis of the topic has been conducted. This study contributes to the knowledge base on workplace learning by science mapping the existing knowledge.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the perceptions of pre-service science teachers on alternative assessment tools they developed using a feedback process. The pre-service teachers received written and verbal feedback during the process; however, they decided themselves to do revisions or not. Consequently, the second purpose of the study was to investigate why the pre-service teachers did not make revisions entirely based on the feedback which was given by researchers. This was a case study with 41 pre-service science teachers participating in "Education Technologies and Material Design" class. Data was collected using perception form including open ended questions as well as interviews conducted with the participants. The written explanations provided by the pre-service teachers to the open-ended questions and interview data were analysed using descriptive analysis. The participants' perceptions of the alternative assessment tools created using a feedback process were categorized themes including suitability to the objectives, daily life association, visual aspects, and higher-order thinking. The study results revealed that the participants perceived themselves as deficient especially in terms of higher-order thinking and daily life association categories. Additionally, the rate of participants benefiting from the feedback process was limited. Study results suggested that practice-based classes in undergraduate teacher training programs may be conducted using rubrics and feedback process. Feedback given to teachers about their performances would be beneficial.

AB  - A key aspect of learning in K-12 education is the idea that what students know and are able to do grows and evolves over time. Simple ideas learned in the early elementary grades gain levels of detail and complexity as students progress in their education. Connections between different topics and disciplines are made. Therefore, a key feature of setting standards for students is to describe learning progressions. Simply put, a "learning progression" is an articulation of the "steps along the way" that a student might go through as he or she works toward mastery of something. Although one path does not apply to all students, some paths are more common than others. "A Framework for K-12 Science Education" (the "Framework") provides specific grade-band endpoints for the disciplinary core ideas and describes progressions for the science and engineering practices and crosscutting concepts. The "Next Generation Science Standards" (NGSS) and other standards based on the "Framework" contain tables of progressions for all three dimensions. What's missing is a way to illustrate these connections. That's where "The NSTA Atlas of the Three Dimensions" comes in. It's your user-friendly guide to understanding how ideas build on one other and relate to each other. With the "NSTA Atlas," you'll be able to trace the prerequisites for understanding science in every grade, make the appropriate connections to support science content, and show the way to the next steps in your students' science education--all in the context of today's standards. The 62 maps in the "NSTA Atlas" organize all of the elements from the standards on a particular topic (e.g., modeling, patterns, or definitions of energy) on a single page. The elements from grades K-2 are at the bottom of the page, and those from grades 9-12 are at the top. Arrows connect elements to indicate how ideas in a particular topic build on each other and how elements in different topics connect to one another. Because the maps prompt you to think about ways student learning can build over time, the "NSTA Atlas" is useful even if you teach in a state that hasn't adopted the NGSS. By studying the maps in the "NSTA Atlas" and the additional resources in the appendixes, you'll gain new insights about the standards and have a powerful navigational tool to help you plan your curriculum, instruction, and assessment.

AB  - Momentum is a foundational concept in physics. Although it is often taught in introductory mechanics courses, there are a limited number of studies on this topic in the literature. The results from these studies have consistently shown that students have difficulties in understanding momentum, especially the connections between net force, time, and change in momentum, which are signs of fragmented knowledge structure and poor knowledge integration. This study adopts the conceptual framework representation to model student understanding and guide the design of an assessment test on momentum. Informed by the previous work on knowledge integration, the conceptual framework maps out the key concepts and their connections within a student's knowledge structure. Recent studies have shown that a conceptual framework can be used as a guide to create assessment items that follow different reasoning pathways, probing various misconceptions and student difficulties. In this study, an assessment of momentum was developed and tested among a large number of U.S. college freshmen and Chinese high school students. Based on testing and interview results, students' understanding is separated into three progression levels of knowledge integration including novice-like, transitional, and expert-like. Furthermore, the comparison between the two countries' curriculum and momentum test results indicates that an emphasis on the central idea of impulse-momentum theorem can be an essential instructional strategy to help students make the necessary connections within their knowledge structure, leading to a deeper conceptual understanding of momentum.

AB  - We present the development and validation of a construct map addressing introductory quantum mechanics topics at the high school level, as a subset of a larger learning progression on quantum mechanics. Topics include energy quantization, photon absorption and emission, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, atom stability, orbitals, wave function, and electronic properties of materials. To validate the hypothesized construct map, we designed a multiple-choice questionnaire and a 14-h teaching-learning sequence (TLS) designed in strict relation with the levels of the construct map. Twenty-three classes of Italian students (ages 17-18, N = 408) were involved in the study: about half (N = 200) were exposed to the TLS, while N = 208 students received a typical textbook instruction on the same topics targeted by the construct map. Data were analyzed using a 1D Rasch model. Results show that the proposed construct map consistently describes the increasing abilities of students when exposed to instruction. In particular, when exposed to the TLS activities, students more likely move towards the upper levels of the construct map. Findings have implications for instruction designed to support students' learning in quantum mechanics at the high school level.

AB  - This review of research used science mapping to analyze the knowledge base on leadership and teacher professional learning in K-12 schools. The review identified 793 Scopus-indexed documents related to this topic. Bibliographic data associated with these documents were examined using bibliometric analyses (e.g. author, journal and document citation and co-citation analysis). These analyses document intellectual progress in this field over time, identify key authors and documents, and institutions, and illuminate the intellectual structure of the field. Initially slow growth in the 1970s and 1980s was followed by markedly accelerating growth of research on this topic continuing to the present. We found three main research streams or Schools of Thought comprising this knowledge base: Teacher Leadership of Professional Learning Communities, Principal Leadership for Teacher Learning, Shared Leadership for Teacher Learning. The review identified a need for substantive reviews of research related to these Schools of Thought. Although the literature evidenced a geographical imbalance favoring Anglo-American-European scholarship, a trend of increasing contributions from other regions of the world was observed and should be encouraged. Scholars entering this field will wish to focus on the key authors and documents identified in this review.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the ability of physics teacher candidates' to read a concept map previously prepared by the researchers about a light topic and then convert the concept map into the appropriate text. The study was carried out in the form of case study method in a Turkish University in the Black Sea Region with 32 physics teacher candidates in the 2016-2017 academic years. To collect data, the concept map about light was given to the physics teacher candidates and they were asked to convert this concept map into meaningful text. The meaningful texts that teacher candidates tried to transform according to the concept map were evaluated according to a reference text. The reference text was prepared by experts. When the findings obtained from the study were examined in general, it was concluded that 78.123% of these physics teacher candidates could read the concept map related to light subjects and concepts at medium level. According to the results of this study, it is recommended that studies related to reading concept maps should be studied for different subjects and concepts.

AB  - Didactic lecture is an effective method to quickly pass on a high volume of information to a large number of students. However, if not well designed, lectures can be monotonous and provide only passive learning, with little scope for higher order learning skills. To address this drawback of lectures, we supplemented it with case-based learning (CBL), which has been shown to promote self-learning. After giving an overview of gastrointestinal physiology through lectures, CBL on peptic ulcer disease was implemented for first-year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery students. The present study aimed to evaluate the students' and teachers' opinions on the notion of supplementing lectures with CBL. In previous reports, discussion using clinical cases was primarily employed as the solitary component for conducting CBL. In the present study, three different but mutually exclusive components, such as case discussion, concept map, and critical thinking exercise on a specific topic in gastrointestinal pathophysiology, were integrated to form the multicomponent CBL (MC-CBL). Students reported that MC-CBL could promote application of the knowledge learned in lectures in a more appropriate context (92.42% positive response), enhance their learning efficiency (98.46% positive response), promote their active participation in the learning process (98.48% positive response), and help them in integrating physiological concepts with clinical science (98.46% positive response). Teachers observed that MC-CBL could promote active learning, analytic, and problem-solving skills of students. In conclusion, MC-CBL appeared to be an effective supplement for the lectures, providing an opportunity for the students to relate the knowledge learned during lectures.

AB  - Concept maps can be used in undergraduate biology as ways to visually communicate the relationships among things and events. One strength of concept mapping is that there is not just a single, correct way to compose one, given a list of particular concepts. Nevertheless there seem to be associations among ideas that are expressed frequently while teaching biology. For example, hierarchical relationships among structures and steps within processes are two common kinds of relationships that students encounter regularly. Based on our own classroom experiences and surveys of concepts appearing in two popular textbooks, we provide here a resource for composing propositions within biological concept maps. This list of more than 50 linking words and phrases is appropriate for freshman biology but can be adapted for use in more advanced courses.

AB  - One challenge associated with introducing systems thinking in chemistry classrooms is the increase in content complexity that students face when they engage in this type of approach. Placing core chemical ideas within larger systems has promise, as long as students are not overwhelmed by the added complexity. Although there are many potential strategies for dealing with complexity, one common tool is to employ visual or graphical tools to help conceptualize the problem or system at hand. In part because systems thinking touches on many potential levels of implementation, there are different visual tools that are helpful in conceptualizing different aspects. Some tools, such as systems-oriented concept map extension (SOCME) diagrams and systemigrams, use methodologies often associated with concept mapping but add features that enhance their applicability in systems thinking. Object-Process Methodology (OPM), which has seen fairly wide use in systems engineering contexts, uses formally defined components and links between them to help conceptualize systems and problems. Many systems of interest are dynamic in nature so tools such as behavior over time graphs (BOTG) are helpful in calibrating the temporal aspects of systems. Such dynamics are also captured via causal loop diagrams and stock and flow diagrams. Here, we introduce and describe the affordances of multiple types of graphical tools that can be used to support systems thinking approaches in chemistry education. Knowing the uses and advantages of these different tools will allow instructors to make informed choices about the tools that will best meet a particular educational goal when using systems thinking approaches in the classroom.

AB  - The flow of materials and energy through society is an integral but poorly visible element of global sustainability agendas such as the Planetary Boundaries Framework and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG). Given that the primary activities of chemistry are to analyze, synthesize, and transform matter, the practice of chemistry has a great deal to contribute to sustainability science, which in turn should play an increasingly important role in reshaping the practice of chemistry. Success in integrating sustainability considerations into the practice of chemistry implies a substantial role for chemistry education to better equip students to address the sustainability of earth and societal systems. Building on the framework of the IUPAC Systems Thinking in Chemistry Education (STICE) project, we develop approaches to using systems thinking to educate students about the molecular basis of sustainability, to assist chemistry to contribute meaningfully and visibly toward the attainment of global sustainability agendas. A detailed exemplar shows how ubiquitous coverage in general chemistry courses of the Haber-Bosch process for the synthesis of ammonia could be extended using systems thinking to consider the complex interplay of this industrial process with scientific, societal, and environmental systems. Systems thinking tools such as systems thinking concept map extension (SOCME) visualizations assist in highlighting inputs, outputs, and societal consequences of this large-scale industrial process, including both intended and unintended alterations to the planetary cycle of nitrogenous compounds. Strategies for using systems thinking in chemistry education and addressing the challenges its use may bring to educators and students are discussed, and suggestions are offered for general chemistry instructors using systems thinking to educate about the molecular basis of sustainability.

AB  - The study assessed the effect of concept map on achievement and classroom management of 7th grade students. Three elementary schools were purposively selected in Silchar town of Assam, India. The 7th grade students (n = 36), of 'School I' was assigned to lecture cum discussion approach, 34, students (n = 34) of 'School II' was assigned to Spider Concept Map Approach (SCMA) and the 30 participants (n=30) of 'School III' was assigned to Hierarchical Concept Map Approach (HCMA). Pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design used to assess the effect of concept map on the achievement and classroom management of students. Pre map test was assigned to both the experimental and comparison group and after three weeks instruction post map test was administered. In addition to these, Concept Map Classroom Management Scale was assigned among all the participants of both experimental and comparison groups to response. The individual pre and post spider concept map and hierarchical concept map, and Concept Map Classroom Management Scale (CMCMS) scores were analyzed through ANCOVA and post hoc Tukey-Kramer Multiple Comparisons. It was resulted that both spider concept map & hierarchical concept map training students in association with those in the comparison group demonstrated significantly better in the performance of photosynthesis and respiration concepts as well as self-classroom management.

AB  - Students always encounter difficulties in studying biochemical pathways. They are especially weak in understanding the relationships between metabolic pathways and their integration because these pathways are always taught one-by-one in class. In the past, various online resources have been developed to facilitate students' understanding toward energy metabolism. Although these learning materials enable students to understand individual metabolic pathway in a clearer manner, many of them fail to demonstrate the linkages between these pathways. The "AG City" is a self-learning tool which aims to arouse students' interest in exploring nucleotide metabolism. We have designed a metro map as a concept map to allow students to have an overview of different pathways as well as their integration. Major pathways are presented as railway lines in an easy-to-understand and interactive manner using navigation, animations, and narrations. Key molecules involved in the pathways are presented as "railway stations". Students can easily identify common "railway stations" presented in different pathways and link the concepts that they have learnt together. This interactive self-learning tool has been packaged as a courseware using the Articulate Storyline eLearning authoring software.

AB  - In this research, the effects of using digitally supported concept maps on the academic success of students in science classes in primary education and their opinions toward the advantages of digitally supported concept maps were examined. The research was conducted with seventh-grade students in a state school in Turkey. This research used a quasi-experimental design with two groups employing a pre-test/post-test. A total of 44 students participating in this study: Twenty-two students in the experiment group and 22 students in the control group. The control group of students experienced the concept maps using pencil and paper (manual) while the experiment used digital education materials. The data were analyzed through t-test to determine whether there was a significant difference between academic success points and then analyzed through content analysis. According to the results of the research, the students who experienced the digitally supported concept maps increased their academic success. These students reported that "learning takes place more easily" through this method. The results of this research show that the students got entertained and motivated much more in the environments that digitally supported concept maps were used.

AB  - This study involved a spiral teaching sequence on acceleration using four instructional strategies, namely: (1) preview of the core concepts, (2) a concept map, (3) conceptual questions, and (4) review of the solutions with a focus on the effective derivation routes and the prevalent difficulties that the students encountered. The participants were 402 grade 12 high school students. The results of this study reveal that the spiral teaching sequence, which introduced multiple stages of practicing and instructional explanation, was effective in terms of improving the students' conceptual reasoning of acceleration. The review of the solutions was perceived by the participants as the most effective teaching strategy, followed by the concept map. We also found that conceptual questions involving a single concept were mostly easier to solve than those involving multiple concepts.

AB  - Network science is an emerging area of complexity science that uses mathematical techniques to study complex systems and could represent a new way of quantifying and investigating the internal structure of domain-specific knowledge as approximated by students' concept maps. Students enrolled in introductory psychology constructed concept maps to represent their understanding of a psychology chapter. Concept networks were constructed based on the concept maps generated by students. Network analysis revealed that the structure of concept networks differed across students (i.e., some networks were better connected than others), and network structure significantly predicted quiz scores, such that concept networks with larger average shortest path lengths (a network metric representing the average of the shortest paths between two nodes in a network) were associated with higher quiz scores, after controlling for network size. This paper illustrates how network science techniques can be used to quantify the conceptual structure of a learner's knowledge.

AB  - This study investigates critical thinking (CT) studies in e-learning settings to provide a comprehensive analysis of CT studies. Research indexed in the Web of Science database which includes major peer-reviewed social sciences citation index journals in the e-learning field from January 2006 to November 2017 was searched for a systematic review and analysis. A total of 42 studies were selected and synthesized. The distribution of publishing years, geographical areas, education sectors, publications, disciplines, research methods, activities, CT measurement instruments, teaching instruction, the CT roles applied in the studies, and the experiment durations were reviewed. The results showed that most CT studies were conducted in nontraditional teaching environments using strategies such as online discussion or concept mapping; the most used quantitative method was the California critical thinking skills test (CCTST), whereas the most frequently adopted qualitative method was the practical inquiry model of cognitive presence (PIMCP). The common method to enhance students' CT was online synchronous or asynchronous discussion, and the role that CT played in these studies was as a dependent variable for evaluating whether the designed e-learning instruction(s) can cultivate CT. This study concludes that with active learning instruction and experienced tutor facilitation, students' CT could be enhanced in a variety of e-learning environments.

AB  - This systematic review used "science mapping" as a means of understanding the evolution of research in educational administration (EA). The review sought to document the size, growth trajectory, and geographic distribution of EA research, identify high impact scholars and documents, and illuminate the "intellectual structure" of the field. Although science mapping has been applied widely in science, medicine, and social sciences, it is still new in the field of education. The authors identified 22,361 peer-reviewed articles published in 22 Scopus-indexed EA journals between 1960 and 2018. The authors used VOSviewer, Excel, and Tableau software to analyze the data set. The review found that the EA knowledge base has grown dramatically since 1960 with an accelerating rate growth and increasing gender and geographic diversity during the past two decades. Using co-citation analysis, the review identified canonical documents, defined as highly influential documents whose impact has been sustained for a period of several decades. The review also identified four key Schools of Thought that have emerged over time focusing on Leadership for Learning, Leadership and Cultural Change, School Effectiveness and School Improvement, and Leading Teachers. More broadly, our findings highlighted a paradigm shift from "school administration" to "school leadership" over the course of the six decades. Another significant finding identified "leadership for student learning and development" as the "cognitive anchor" of the intellectual structure of the EA knowledge base. The authors conclude that science mapping offers a new and useful means of unpacking the historical development of fields of study.

AB  - The ability to categorize concepts is an essential capability for human thinking and action. On the one hand, the investigation of such abilities is the purview of psychology; on the other hand, subject-specific educational research is also of interest, as a number of research works in the field of science education show. For computer science education, no corresponding studies are currently available. However, investigating how learners build categories from a choice of given terms may be useful for several reasons; for example, learners' perspectives on relations between terms, as well as potential misconceptions, can be detected and made available to educators aiming to improve lesson planning. Therefore, we conducted an empirical study with 490 German students from primary to higher education, in which we presented them with 23 information technology-related terms (such as computer, Facebook, hard drive, virus) on a questionnaire, with the task of assigning these to self-defined categories (and then giving their categories individual names). In the results, we identified a number of potential categorization strategies the participants might have used to categorize the given terms; these include generalization, purpose, place of use, state, part-whole relationships, and association. Recognizing and defining such categorization strategies can help teachers construct learner-adequate concept maps of the domain, which helps foster the elaboration of learners' knowledge structures in this field. We found that the younger participants used less abstract names for their categories, and observed that some participants had difficulty categorizing some terms (such as robot and 3D).

AB  - Research has shown that retrieval activities, that is, actively recalling previously studied information, may substantially contribute to learning from complex educational materials, sometimes more so than other more popular techniques such as rereading and elaborative study. In this context, recent studies (Blunt and Karpicke, J Educ Psychol 106:849-858, 2014) have reported that two different retrieval formats (free recall by writing down as many ideas as possible and creating a concept map in the absence of texts) are equally effective as learning tools. Given the benefits frequently attributed to concept mapping and the potential practical implications of this finding, we aimed to further examine the relative effectiveness of both retrieval-based activities. In Experiment 1, we conceptually replicated the main finding from Blunt and Karpicke's study to show that the two formats may lead to similar learning outcomes. In Experiment 2, we coupled both retrieval formats but manipulated the order in which the activities were performed. Results revealed that retrieval-based concept mapping before free recall by means of paragraph writing resulted in better learning on a 2-week delayed test than performing the same activities the other way round. These findings contradict the general idea that it is retrieval itself, regardless of the activity it is embedded in, what promotes learning. From a more applied standpoint, our results join others from recent studies to show that combining different retrieval activities when dealing with educational materials might be particularly effective.

AB  - Geography as a discipline is a multi-disciplinary science which has an ability to reach out to masses through its very nature. It has an in-built affinity towards technology which has been integrated in the subject even before many other Social Science subjects adopted it. The visible collaboration of Geography with technology started during the post Quantitative Revolution period when computer was adopted for research and study of various aspects of the subject. Since then, integration of technology into the subject has come through various ways and has resulted in achieving far reaching goals. The focus of the paper primarily rests at discussing various ways in which ICT can be integrated in teaching and learning of Geography at the school level. This has been reached through tracing the origin and implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in India, its components and tools.

AB  - Student questioning is an important self-regulative strategy and has multiple benefits for teaching and learning science. Teachers, however, need support to align student questioning to curricular goals. This study tests a prototype of a principle-based scenario that supports teachers in guiding effective student questioning. In the scenario, mind mapping is used to provide both curricular structure as well as support for student questioning. The fidelity of structure and the process of implementation were verified by interviews, video data and a product collection. Results show that the scenario was relevant for teachers, practical in use and effective for guiding student questioning. Results also suggest that shared responsibility for classroom mind maps contributed to more intensive collective knowledge construction.

AB  - There has been little attention given to teaching beliefs of graduate teaching assistants (GTAs), even though they represent the primary teaching workforce for undergraduate students in discussion and laboratory sections at many research universities. Secondary school education studies have shown that teaching beliefs are malleable and can be shaped by professional development, particularly for inexperienced teachers. This study characterized inexperienced GTAs' teaching beliefs about student learning and how they change with a science-specific pedagogy course that emphasized student learning. GTA teaching beliefs were characterized as traditional (providing information to students), instructive (providing activities for students), and transitional (focusing on student-teacher relationships). At the start of the course, traditional, instructive, and transitional beliefs were emphasized comparably in the concept maps and presentations of inexperienced GTAs. At the end of the course, although GTAs' beliefs remained mostly teacher focused, they were more instructive than traditional or transitional. GTAs included teaching strategies and jargon from the course in their concept maps but provided minimal explanations about how opportunities for active student engagement would impact student learning. These results suggest there is a need to provide ongoing discipline-specific professional development to inexperienced GTAs as they develop and strengthen their teaching beliefs about student learning.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of the Mind Maps Teaching Method and the Conventional Teaching Method on tenth graders' immediate achievement and retention of electric energy concepts in Jordan. Participants (N=111 students; M=52, F=59) were randomly selected from Bani Kenanah region, north of Jordan. One group was assigned to the Mind Maps Teaching Method (n=54) and other group was assigned to the Conventional Teaching Method (n=57). A multiple-choice physics concept test and open-ended questions were developed and used. The results showed that the Mind Maps Teaching Method was more effective than the Conventional Teaching Method in immediate achievement and retention of electric energy concepts. There was a significant difference for students' gender on immediate achievement but not on retention. The findings recommended that curriculum developers and textbook authors should consider the characteristics of brain parts and their information process in any curriculum design and textbook development. Mind mapping should not be separated from any pedagogical practice in physics instruction.

AB  - Is it possible to teach biology without mentioning evolution? The answer is yes, but it is not possible for students to understand biology without the evolutionary context on which the meaning and intellectual value of biological concepts depend. Meaningful learning of evolution requires (1) that the students incorporate new knowledge into a cognitive structure linked with higher-order concepts; (2) a well-organized knowledge structure; and (3) a positive emotional attachment and identification (affective commitment) to the subject by the learner. Concept maps are useful tools in meaningful learning. We present a concept map that organizes concepts of history of life and the processes that generate it, and the hierarchical relationships among them. Biological evolution is a compelling account of life on Earth and of human origins. It constitutes a unifying explanatory framework that can generate a powerful affective commitment to the subject. The concept map provided here is tied to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).

AB  - Recent studies documented that the act of writing explanations improves students' learning only to a limited extent, as students attend less frequently to genre-typical features of comprehensibility during writing explanations (i.e., cohesion). In this study, we investigated whether learning by writing explanations can be enhanced when students additionally receive computer-based feedback on the cohesion of their explanations. Sixty-one advanced students studied a hyper-text about photovoltaic panels. Afterwards, they provided a written explanation about the learning content. During writing, students randomly received either individual computer-based feedback in the form of a concept map or not. Our findings indicated that students who received additional concept map feedback outperformed students without such feedback on a transfer test. Mediation analyses revealed that the effect of the concept map feedback on students' transfer was mediated by the level of global cohesion of the provided explanations. Thus, we can conclude that learning by writing explanations can be enhanced by formative computer-based feedback that provides specific information about the quality of students' written explanations.

AB  - In this chapter, eight foci relevant for science educators are presented and illustrated by paradigmatic examples and discussed in two parts. The first part "from science education to practice and authorities" discusses the four foci of: (1) developing concepts for instruction; (2) responding to the needs of schools; (3) connecting researchers, teachers, and stakeholders; and (4) implementing research results into practice. The second part "from practice and authorities to science education" includes a further four foci: (5) reframing recent scientific research as science content for schools; (6) considering non-formal teaching-learning processes; (7) helping to create curricular and structural changes; and (8) being aware of his/her own responsibilities. The paradigmatic examples discussed are from recent research projects in science education, for example, the development of new instruments for formative and summative assessment, the comparison of different test formats like multiple-choice problems and concept map problems, the implementation of a new interdisciplinary curricula, the development of a so-called MobiLab, and the collaboration with scientists and entrepreneurs in nanoscience. It is discussed why the foci and examples are important to researchers and educators and which lessons can be learnt.

AB  - What are the current challenges and opportunities for bringing actor-network theory (ANT) into issues-based science education? This article discusses experiences gained from introducing an educational version of ANT deploying digital technology into an upper secondary school science class. This teaching innovation, called "controversy mapping", has been pioneered in different contexts of higher education before being adapted to school education. Experimenting with controversy mapping in a Swedish science class raised both conceptual and practical issues. These centre on: (1) how ANT-inspired controversy mapping redesigns the citizenship training enacted by institutionalized approaches to issues-based education as socioscientific issues (SSI); (2) how controversy mapping reconfigures the interdisciplinarity of issues-based science education; and (3) how controversy mapping displaces scientific literacy and knowledge of the nature of science as guiding concerns for teaching in favour of new preoccupations with digital literacy and digital tools and methods as contemporary infrastructures of free and open inquiry.

AB  - The purpose of this exploratory qualitative study was to investigate prospective elementary teachers' conceptual understanding of buoyancy. Specifically, the study aimed to identify the scientifically accepted conceptions, and misconceptions that preservice teachers hold about buoyancy using an instructional intervention. Presently, there is a gap in the research literature concerning how preservice teachers understand floating and sinking as it relates to the scientific concept of buoyancy. Conceptions were analyzed using pre/post concept maps, and interviews. Findings showed that preservice teachers had scientifically accepted conceptions and misconceptions about buoyancy as a force and that both conceptions interacted with associated concepts of buoyancy (gravity, weight, mass, density, etc.). Overall, preservice teachers showed a significant deficiency in their content knowledge of buoyancy at the end of the study. Implications include (1) the need for teacher educators to review the science content courses prospective teachers are required to take for certification; and, (2) the need for elementary teachers to understand the concept of buoyancy and all related concepts in order to develop and implement curricula related to the topic of buoyancy.

AB  - In this article, we explored learners' conceptual understanding of coordinates and transformation geometry through concept mapping. A qualitative case study was employed in this study, and data was collected using an investigative task, observation and reflective interviews on a sample of 34 Grade 12 mathematics learners. The study was guided by the following two research questions: What are the learners' understanding of coordinate and transformation geometry? and How do concept maps improve learners' understanding of coordinate and transformation geometry? The study revealed that, although some learners struggled with linking words and omitted some concepts in their concept maps, there were some indications of conceptual understanding of coordinate and transformation geometry when the learners were probed during the interview. Thus, we argue that the learners' conceptual understanding of coordinate and transformation geometry could be improved when they are taught, using concept mapping. The learners actively situated their knowledge of small pieces of coordinates and transformation geometry; and their understanding of coordinate and transformation geometry was expanded to show the conceptual structure of representing given information and a complete picture of the situation. It is therefore recommended that the teachers allow the learners to use the concept mapping strategy to construct their knowledge and that concept maps assist the learners in focusing on main ideas of identified concepts and explain the relationship.

AB  - Modern science standards emphasize knowledge-in-use, i.e., connecting scientific practices with content. For knowledge to become usable in knowledge-in-use performances, students need well organized knowledge networks that allow them to activate and connect sets of relevant ideas across contexts, i.e. students need integrated knowledge. We conducted a longitudinal interview study with 30 students in a 7th grade energy unit and used network analysis to investigate students' integrated knowledge, i.e., their knowledge networks. Linking these results with results from knowledge-in-use assessments, we found a strong connection between integrated knowledge and knowledge-in-use about energy. Further, we found evidence that well-connected ideas around the idea of energy transfer were particularly helpful for using energy ideas in the knowledge-in-use assessments. We present network analysis as a valuable extension of existing approaches to investigating students' knowledge networks and the connection between them and knowledge-in-use.

AB  - Although computer-supported collaborative learning has been successfully applied in educational settings to improve group learning performance, most such systems still lack effective strategies for knowledge representation which could help reduce discussion time. In this study, concept mapping, already applied as a tool to help visualize and organize existing or newly learned knowledge, is incorporated to address this problem in a newly developed concept map and computer-supported collaborative learning system (CMCLS). It was designed as a quasi-experiment study and was carried out with 77 university students. The system was first used by the groups of students to illustrate their knowledge and achieve consensus during a learning activity, after which their performance and feelings of satisfaction with this innovative approach were evaluated. Patterns of learning within the proposed framework were explored. The learning behaviors, including the actions and interactions with peers of the participants during the learning activity were recorded. Finally, lag-sequential analysis was used to compare the interactions and the differences in the behavior patterns of the two groups, one using the newly developed CMCLS consensus map-embedded approach and a control group which did not use this approach. The results showed significant improvement in the learning achievement of students using the novel approach, as well as a higher degree of perceived usefulness and satisfaction. The novel consensus map-embedded approach was useful for knowledge construction and for assisting with integration of the team members' results to produce the final ER diagram.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to identify conditions for the effective use of visual modeling tools that can help reduce the difficulty level of solving problems during the teaching high school students programming. Visual modeling tools are a type of software that allows you to create visual abstractions that reproduce concepts and objects of the real world with their relationships, which can help in solving the problem. In this paper, we focused on preformal models based on intellect- and concept-maps. The article gives a classification and describes techniques for using various visual modeling tools to solve problem tasks. Formed skills of working with such tools will allow students to produce, represent and express independently their knowledge. In addition, these tools allow structuring the process of solving the problem, optimizing the time for solving each stage of solving a problem task. The article presents the results of comparing the learning outcomes of the control and experimental groups, which show that the proposed visual modeling tools can help in solving the programming problem tasks.

AB  - The results of the implementation of formative assessment into chemistry education at secondary school for the topic "Mixtures" are presented here. Students (12-14 years old, N=202) were divided into two groups--control (N=97) and experimental (N=105). Teachers of experimental group implemented formative assessment tools into ten lessons (a predictive card, Frayer model, self-assessment card, T-card, concept map, and exit card). Control group teachers taught without formative assessment. The Mann-Whitney U test confirmed statistically significant results (p<0.05). [For the full proceedings, see ED619611.]

AB  - Discussion forums in learning management systems (LMS) have been shown to promote student interaction and contribute to the collaborative practice in the teaching-learning process. By evaluating the postings, teachers can identify students with learning difficulties. However, due to the large volume of posts that are generated on a daily basis in these environments, manual analysis becomes impractical. This article proposes a mechanism to support teaching through the thematic relevance analysis of the posts made by students in discussion forums. For this, text mining and metrics from network science were used to process and extract characteristics of the texts. Then, the processed texts were classified through supervised learning algorithms. The results show that the use of these techniques may generate potentially useful indicators for teachers to help them improve their pedagogical practices.

AB  - Adaptive curriculum sequencing (ACS) is still a challenge in the adaptive learning field. ACS is a NP-hard problem especially considering the several constraints of the student and the learning material when selecting a sequence from repositories where several sequences could be chosen. Therefore, this has stimulated several researchers to use evolutionary approaches in the search for satisfactory solutions. This work explores the use of an adaptation of the prey-predator algorithm for the ACS problem. Pedagogical experiments with a real student dataset and convergence experiments with a synthetic dataset have shown that the proposed solution is suitable for the problem, although it is a solution not yet explored in the adaptive learning literature.

AB  - Systems thinking is an important skill in science and engineering education. Our study objectives were (1) to create the basis for a systems thinking language common to both science education and engineering education, and (2) to apply this language to assess science and engineering teachers' systems thinking. We administered two assignments to teacher teams: first, modelling the same adapted scientific text, and second, modelling a synthesis of peer-reviewed articles in science and engineering education, with teams selecting a topic from a list and summarising them. We assessed those models using a rubric for systems thinking we had developed based on our literature review of this topic. We found high interrater reliability and validated the rubric's theoretical construct for the system aspects of function, structure and behaviour. We found differences in scores between the assignments in favour of the second assignment, for two attributes of systems thinking: 'expected outcome/intended purpose' and 'main object and its sub-objects'. We explain the first attribute difference as stemming from the modellers' domain expertise as science or engineering teachers, rather than as scientists or engineers, and the second attribute difference -- from the larger amount of information available for modelling the articles synthesis assignment. The theoretical contribution of this study lies in the definition of the systems thinking construct as a first step in establishing a common language for the science education and engineering education communities. The study's methodological contribution lies in the rubric we developed and validated, which can be used for assessing the systems thinking of teachers and potentially also of undergraduate students.

AB  - Evidence-based approaches to assessment design, development, and administration provide a strong foundation for an assessment's validity argument but can be time consuming, resource intensive, and complex to implement. This article describes an evidence-based approach used for one assessment that addresses these challenges. Evidence-centered design principles were applied to create a task template to support test development for a new, instructionally embedded, large-scale alternate assessment system used for accountability purposes in 18 US states. Example evidence from the validity argument is presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the template as an evidence-based method for test development. Lessons learned, including strengths and challenges, are shared to inform test-development efforts for other programs.

AB  - The aim of this research is to ask what kind of geography is taught in Finnish upper secondary schools and whether this knowledge is powerful knowledge. This is achieved by analysing 11 in-service geography teachers' concept maps and in-depth interviews with qualitative data analysis. The results indicate the dominance of three terms: spatiality, phenomena and a holistic approach running through the teachers' conceptions of geographical knowledge, skills and assessment. Geography is described by the teachers as a science which studies extensive spatial phenomena with the help of concepts and a holistic approach and in which values and students' own lived experiences play a major role. We conclude that the in-service Finnish upper secondary teachers' perceptions of geography are a form of powerful knowledge because they: (1) urge students to form new geographical thinking about the world, (2) give possibilities for students to study geographical phenomena and (3) evaluate their own knowledge, (4) encourage students to follow topical debates in different scales, (5) open up the students' world views and (6) support the general objectives of Finnish upper secondary schools by applying four of the six cross-curricular themes to a great extent in teaching geography, particularly sustainable development.

AB  - Teachers play a role in promoting teaching and learning strategies to address the complexity of concepts. Systems thinking is a strategy for achieving meaningful learning. Doubt exists over the extent to which the latter has been converted into appropriate classroom practice at under-resourced rural schools in one province in South Africa. This paper reports on a research study with teachers in six primary schools who developed a systems thinking concept map for teaching and learning to help teachers understand the interconnectedness of soil and climate change. The method of evaluation of the concept maps was based on Novak and Gowin's scoring protocol. The concept map analysis of the six illustrations by teachers yielded one excellent, one good, two poor and two fail maps. The study reveals, from the scoring and focus group interviews that the teachers in this case study struggled to understand the interconnectedness of soil and climate change. The majority of the systems thinking concept maps developed, unsuccessfully illustrated how soil can mitigate the impact of climate change. Teachers in this case study lacked confidence in their knowledge of concepts influencing the outcome of their concept maps that lacked interconnections, validating teacher ignorance about systems thinking.

AB  - Primary school students generally lack motivation for learning physics, which they perceive as a difficult subject. In order to overcome this problem, it is necessary to apply appropriate teaching approach. The aim of this research was to assess the educational efficiency of mind maps in physics and students' involvement when this approach is used. A pre-test--post-test control group design was used. The sample of this research consisted of 113 seventh-grade students divided into an experimental and a control group. The students in the experimental group were taught physics using mind maps and the students in the control group were taught using conventional teaching approach. The data were collected by using two physics knowledge tests and perceived mental effort scale. The data were analyzed using ANOVA, t-test and chi-square test. The obtained results showed that the educational efficiency of teaching with the use of mind maps was greater than the efficiency of conventional teaching approach. Besides that, the students' involvement in the experimental group was higher than the one in the control group. The implementation of mind maps in teaching physics in primary schools can increase students' motivation for learning physics and lower their mental effort.

AB  - One of the key agendas for the emerging field of disciplinary-based education research is the evaluation of the trajectory of disciplinary knowledge development from novice to expert. However, with the ongoing promotion of student-centered and collaborative undergraduate science classrooms, it is unknown how peer discourse during these exercises might influence (promote or hinder) student construction of expert knowledge. This study documented the knowledge structures of n = 13 undergraduate biology students in a first semester biology course for majors across four instructional units. Participants constructed both individual and group-negotiated concept maps and map complexity, propositional stream similarity, and propositional accuracy were used as measures of quality of knowledge structure. Results indicated that on individually-constructed maps, in general, students had moderate quality knowledge structures when compared to experts. Individual map complexity seemed to increase over time, but stream similarity and propositional accuracy were more dependent on content unit. Group-constructed maps were consistently more accurate than individually-constructed maps. Results are discussed in the context of the use of collaborative concept mapping as a means to develop disciplinary expertise in biology.

AB  - In this study, it was aimed to determine the effects of the learning process based on the 5E Model Supported by Real Life Based Context in the Unit of Force and Energy in the course of Science on the conceptual understanding levels of the students at the seventh grade which are measured various techniques. The research was designed with quasi-experimental design with pre-test post-test control group and the lessons were taught in the experimental groups through lesson plans developed according to 5E Model Supported by Life Based Contexts while, in the control groups, the lessons were conducted through methods based on transmitting or presenting information. The study group of the research consists of 80 students who study at the level of the seventh grade. The conceptual understanding levels of the students were measured through the Life-Based Concept Test and Concept Maps. The data of the research was analyzed via MANOVA statistical method. The students in the experimental group were seen to have higher average statistically significant scores in both Life-Based Concept Test and Force and Energy Concept Maps when compared to the students in the control group. In the research, it was observed through tests in various formats that the teaching process conducted based on real life contexts through integrating the Life Based Approach into 5E Model was effective on the development of conceptual understanding levels of the students in the unit of Force and Energy.

AB  - Plate tectonics is the organizing paradigm of geosciences, but it is also conceptually complex, and students often struggle with developing a system level understanding of the earth. This article reports on research designed to create a characterization of the different levels of sophistication around plate tectonics in the form of a learning progression for middle grades (grades 6--9). A learning progression is an educational research construct that can guide curriculum, assessment, and instruction by creating a description not just of students' misunderstandings but of a sequential pattern of increasingly sophisticated and productive student conceptions. This article reports on research findings from a 7-year National Science Foundation-funded project focused on the teaching and learning of earth and space science, which engaged in hundreds of conceptual interviews with students in diverse contexts across the state of Pennsylvania. This article focuses on the implications for higher education faculty in geosciences with regard to the preparation of students, the likely alternative conceptions they may hold, and hence instructional approaches to help their ideas mature toward a normative scientific understanding.

AB  - The collection and selection of the data used in learning analytics applications deserve more attention. Optimally, selection of data should be guided by pedagogical purposes instead of data availability. Using design science research methodology, we designed an artifact to collect time-series data on students' self-regulated learning and conceptual thinking. Our artifact combines curriculum data, concept mapping, and structured learning diaries. We evaluated the artifact in a case study, verifying that it provides relevant data, requires a limited amount of effort from students, and works in different educational contexts. Combined with learning analytics applications and interventions, our artifact provides possibilities to add value for students, teachers, and academic leaders.

AB  - Climate scientists agree that (a) human activity is a significant driver of recent climate change, and (b) climate change is a danger to humanity. However, the general public accepts the former point, but rejects the latter. Thus, climate experts and the general public diverge in their understanding of the relationship between humans and climate change. My dissertation examines the role of intuitive patterns of thinking in public perceptions of climate change. Of specific interest is construal-based thinking: intuitive frameworks that are generally useful in the context of everyday reasoning, but can engender systematic misconceptions in other scientific domains (e.g., biology). Results revealed that one such construal--anthropic thinking--is recruited when thinking about climate change and impacts global climate change understanding and engagement. Anthropic thinking is a set of intuitive frameworks that are united in their distortion of the relationship between humans and the natural world. Among these frameworks are "exceptionalist thinking" (i.e., thinking that humans are exceptional to, and unique from other species) and "anthropomorphic thinking" (i.e., the attribution of human properties to non-human organisms). I conducted four studies to examine whether undergraduates recruit anthropic thinking in the context of global climate change, and the consequences of reliance on such patterns of thinking. Study One examined construal-based thinking about global climate change using an in-lab battery designed for this purpose. I modified sets of pre-existing measures of construal-based thinking to inquire about climate change. Of the investigated construals, participants only consistently engaged in exceptionalist thinking about climate change which tended to involve the correct belief that humans are uniquely contributing to climate change and the incorrect belief that humans are uniquely impervious to the effects of climate change. Moreover, participants performed similarly on measures of exceptionalist thinking about climate change and biology--a domain that is understood to be susceptible to such patterns of thinking. Study Two tested whether individuals spontaneously engage in construal-based thinking about climate change by investigating patterns of language used during semi-structured interviews about climate change. Of the investigated construals, participants most commonly used anthropic patterns of language to describe climate change. Anthropomorphic language was particularly common, revealing that individuals attributed human qualities (e.g., emotions, goals) to non-human organisms (e.g., the Earth, plants and animals) when discussing climate change. Interestingly, the use of such language during these interviews predicted increased understanding of climate change, suggesting that use of anthropomorphic analogies might aid understandings. Further, participants used exceptionalist language when describing both causes and effects of climate change, corroborating findings from the first study. Study Three investigated the predictive role of anthropic thinking in understanding and concern surrounding global climate change. Using a time-pressured manipulation, I encouraged individuals to either respond quickly (preventing them from using more deliberate reasoning strategies) or slowly (allowing deliberate strategies) to a set of true/false questions about climate change. Surprisingly, exceptionalist and anthropomorphic thinking only predicted climate change understanding in the time delay condition, suggesting that anthropic thinking is not readily available to influence knowledge when individuals must make responses quickly, but rather, may represent a more deliberative reasoning heuristic. Furthermore, anthropomorphic thinking was positively associated with concern about global climate change across conditions. Combined with findings from Study Two, these demonstrate that anthropic thinking could have a role in both aiding and hindering understanding and engagement with climate change. Finally, Study Four investigated whether exceptionalist thinking about climate change could be reduced by increasing the salience of conceptual connections between humans and global climate change. To do so, I used a concept-mapping task wherein individuals drew connections between human-related concepts (e.g., burning fossil fuels) and global climate change. Participants who completed concepts maps at the beginning of the battery showed decreased exceptionalist thinking about climate change causes and effects compared to those who completed concept maps at the end of the battery, suggesting that exceptionalist thinking about climate change may rest on decreased salience that humans both (a) play a role in causing climate change and (b) will be affected by climate change. Exceptionalist thinking also predicted decreased attribution of damage due to recent environmental disasters (e.g., hurricanes Florence and Michael) to global climate change. This demonstrates a way in which exceptionalist thinking might act as a cognitive barrier to understanding how climate change can impact humans. This body of research extends previous investigations of intuitive thinking and scientific understandings to a novel and timely domain: global climate change. Notably, these findings demonstrate that people recruit exceptionalism and anthropomorphism when thinking about climate change, and that these patterns of thinking influence their understanding and engagement with the issue. I discuss the implications of these results for education, and their potential utility in the development of interventions to improve public perceptions of climate change as well as science more broadly.

AB  - The purpose of this present action research study was to describe secondary students' feelings of self-efficacy in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Through a curriculum linked to a science fair project, the teacher-researcher focused on student-participants' perceptions of perseverance and task completion linked to STEM courses and postsecondary STEM careers. A Likert scale pretest (n=44) and posttest (n=33) based on Bandura's model of four categories of self-efficacy (mastery experience, vicarious experiences, verbal/social persuasion, and emotional/psychological states) was administered to middle to low income students at a high school in Pennsylvania in the fall of 2018.). Data was also collected data through semi-structured interviews, informal interviews, teacher journal entries, observational field notes, and concept maps. Findings revealed that there was a 3.19% decrease across the cumulative average of all participants in STEM self-efficacy, and a 0.25% increase in the cumulative average of the economically disadvantaged group. Three domains were measured in this action research: social, academic, and emotional. For the social domain, there was a 0.84% decrease in scores across the entire population, with scores of 33.75 on the pretest and 33.47 on the posttest. Within this domain, average scores for the economically disadvantaged population increased by 5.81% pretest to posttest from 33.83 to 35.8, respectively. Academic domain scores decreased by 3.27%, from 33.18 pretest to 32.10 postest. In the same domain, economically disadvantaged students decreased from 3.61%, from 33.75 pretest to 33.54 posttest. Lastly, emotional scores dropped 5.99% among the entire population, from 31.09 pretest to 29.23 posttest and emotional scores in the economically disadvantaged decreased by 4.79%, from 30.25 pretest to 28.8 posttest. This data was polyangulated through semi-structured interviews, informal interviews, teacher journal entries, observational field notes, and concept maps. To improve participation of economically disadvantaged students in STEM science fairs, an action plan of researching, developing, and sharing strategies for self-efficacy in learners will be developed. This data is helpful as it provided a platform for an action plan to be facilitated to improve the Science Fair preparation process to promote STEM self-efficacy.

AB  - This review of research employed science mapping to analyse the intellectual structure of the knowledge base on educational leadership and management in Africa. The review analysed 645 Scopus-indexed documents on EDLM in Africa published between 1960 and 2018. Meta data associated with these documents were analysed using the VOSviewer software. The complementary use of citation and co-citation analysis determined that 95% of the African literature in EDLM has been published since 2000. Geographical distribution of African scholarship was highly skewed with South African scholarship accounting for 74% of the corpus. Citations analyses also identified highly cited scholars and documents within this literature. Analysis of the intellectual structure of the African EDLM knowledge base identified four main Schools of Thought. Three of these were comprised primarily of Africa-based scholarship and determined to be 'distinctively African' in terms of topical foci. The 'research front' or most current topical trend in this literature concerns leadership for educational and social transformation. Recommendations are made for building capacity among African EDLM scholars as well as for next steps in advancing the literature.

AB  - The need for all students to develop a stronger ability to express their science knowledge in writing is important. In this article, the authors take you on a journey in an elementary school classroom with tools to help foster deeper learning and stronger writing skills in science content. With many students in high school required to pass end-of-semester science exams to receive a diploma, teaching writing at an early age across various content areas is an even more critical component of today's curriculum. Presenting curriculum material through multiple means (Universal Design for Learning-Representation) allows students to gain information through a learning approach that best fits the students' learning needs. The authors examine multiple means of representing science curriculum to engage students in creating detailed and comprehensive concept maps and to provide supportive scientific evidence in written explanations as they gain more content knowledge in science.

AB  - The research assessed secondary school students' conceptions of acid-base strengths by using the conceptual change instruction accompanied with concept maps and analogies. These teaching strategies were employed to help them make unfamiliar events familiar. Within a quasi-experimental design, the sample of the study consisted of 73 secondary school students. Pre- and post-tests were used to collect data. The results showed that the experimental group that took the conceptual change-oriented instruction performed better than the control group. In light of the results, it can be concluded that employing such visuals and interactive materials as concept maps and analogies for achieving conceptual change is effective in generating better understanding of chemistry concepts.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of teachers' use of "focus questions" on students' knowledge structures and classroom teaching-learning process by re-analyzing selected data from a quasi-experimental pre-post video study (Wadouh, 2007). Focus questions are content-related anchoring questions highlighting the key content taught in individual lessons (Forbes & Davis, 2010). In Wadouh' study, students answered a knowledge test before and after the lesson on "blood and the circulatory system" and one lesson per teacher was videotaped to investigate teaching practices in grade 9 biology classrooms. Students also completed a post-unit concept mapping exercise and a motivation-interest questionnaire. In this study, 30 lesson videos selected from 47 were re-analyzed for teachers' use of focus questions--no focus questions, non-specific or simple focus questions, and specific and challenging focus questions. Individual students' scores in the concept mapping exercise were aggregated as "students' topic-related knowledge structure". Multilevel analyses revealed a significant positive effect of teachers' use of "specific and challenging focus questions" on students' topic-related knowledge structure. Furthermore, a comparative case analysis of the classroom teaching-learning process was conducted in four lessons where teachers used specific and challenging focus questions in two of the lessons and non-specific or simple focus questions in the other two lessons. The findings indicate that specific and challenging focus questions anchored lessons on students' co-construction of scientific explanations by activating their pre-instructional ideas, whereas "non-specific or simple focus questions" anchored lessons on their accumulation of canonical scientific knowledge. This study's limitations and implications for teacher education reform are discussed.

AB  - The use of external representations has a potential to facilitate inquiry learning, especially in hypothesis generation and scientific reasoning, which are typical difficulties encountered by students. This study proposes and investigates the effects of a three-dimensional thinking graph (3DTG) that allows learners to combine in a single image, problem information, subject knowledge (key concepts and their relationships), and the hypothesizing and reasoning process involved in exploring a problem, to support inquiry learning. Two classes of eleventh grade students (97 in total) were randomly assigned to use either the 3DTG (i.e., experimental condition) or concept map (i.e., control condition) to complete a group-based inquiry task in an online environment. Data were collected from multiple data sources, including measures of group inquiry task performance, postknowledge scores, postquestionnaires of student perceptions of consensus building, and open-ended survey. The analysis of group task performance revealed that participants in the experimental condition performed better in the inquiry task than their counterparts specifically in generating hypotheses and reasoning with data, but not in drawing conclusions. The findings show the 3DTG's benefits in facilitating exploring and justifying hypotheses, and also suggest that the 3DTG can share equal value with concept mapping in terms of drawing conclusions and consensus building. In addition, students using the 3DTG achieved higher scores in the postknowledge test, although no difference was found in their perceptions of consensus building. These findings were validated by students' responses to the survey. Implications of this study and future work are also discussed.

AB  - Most chemistry educators agree that deep understanding of the nature of noncovalent interactions is essential for learning in chemistry. Yet decades of research have shown that students have persistent incorrect ideas about these interactions. We have worked in collaboration with a community of chemistry, biology, and biochemistry educators to develop a construct map to guide development of instructional and assessment resources related to the physical basis of noncovalent interactions in a biochemical context. This map was devised using data about student learning and expert perspectives on noncovalent interactions, resulting in a framework that provides a detailed roadmap for teaching and learning related to this essential concept. Here we describe the development of the construct map and our use of it to reform our biochemistry teaching practice. Because biochemistry relies on application of concepts learned in prerequisite courses, this construct map could be useful for wide range of courses including general chemistry, introductory biology, organic chemistry, and biochemistry.

AB  - The goal of this study was to identify and understand the mental models developed by 67 high school biology students as they learn about the human body as a complex system. Using concept maps, it sought to find an external way of representing how students organize their ideas about the human body system in their minds. We conducted a qualitative analysis of four concept maps created by each student throughout the 3-year learning process, which allowed us to identify that student's systems thinking skills and the development of those skills over time. The improvement trajectories of the students were defined according to three central characteristics of complex systems: (a) hierarchy, (b) homeostasis and (c) dynamism. A comparative analysis of all of our students' individual trajectories together revealed four typical learning patterns, each of which reflects a different form of development for systems thinking: "from the structure to the process level", "from macro to micro level", "from the cellular level to the organism level," and "development in complexity of homeostasis mechanisms". Despite their differences, each of these models developed over time from simpler structures, which evolved as they connected with more complex system aspects, and each indicates advancement in the student's systems thinking.

AB  - In computer science, students could benefit from exposure to critical programming concepts from multiple perspectives. Peer review is one method to allow students to experience authentic uses of the concepts in an activity that is not itself programming. In this work, we examine how to implement the peer review process in early, object-oriented computer science courses as a way to increase the students' knowledge of programming concepts, specifically Abstraction, Decomposition, and Encapsulation, and to develop their higher-level thinking skills. We are exploring the peer review process, the effects of the type of review "on the reviewers," and the results this has on the students' learning. To study these ideas, we used peer review activities in CS2 classes at two universities over the course of a semester. Using three groups (one reviewing their peers, one reviewing the instructor, and one completing small design or coding assignments), we measured the students' conceptual understanding throughout the semester with concept maps and the reviews they completed. We found that reviewing helped students learn Decomposition, especially those reviewing the instructor's programs, but we did not find that it improved the students' level of thinking. Overall, reviews (peer or otherwise) are beneficial for teaching Decomposition to CS2 students and can be used as an alternative method for teaching other object-oriented programming concepts.

AB  - The research practices of academics of science teaching and learning (academics-"of-st&l") may be considered a connected, constructed landscape, the peaks of which are shaped by accumulation of like practices. Entangling interviews with twenty-seven academics-"of-st&l" and document analyses, in this paper I map the presence of two landscape peaks--scientific and theoretical practice--in addition to their material-communal effects. This mapping renders our research landscape as an ongoing production in need of ethical attunement. Invoking ethics of Deleuzeguattarian thinking and flow in my mappings, I conceptualize cartography as a mode of inquiry disruptive to normative research methodology used in science teaching and learning, capable of enabling landscape reconfiguration.

AB  - Understanding genetic mechanisms affords the ability to provide causal explanations for genetic phenomena. These mechanisms are difficult to teach and learn. It has been shown that students sometimes conceive of genes as traits or as trait-bearing particles. We termed these "nonmechanistic" conceptions of genetic phenomena because they do not allow the space required for a mechanism to exist in the learner's mind. In this study, we investigated how ninth- and 12th-grade students' conceptions of genetic phenomena affect their ability to learn the underlying mechanisms. We found that ninth- and 12th-grade students with nonmechanistic conceptions are less successful at learning the mechanisms leading from gene to trait than students with mechanistic conceptions. Our results suggest that nonmechanistic conceptions of a phenomenon may create a barrier to learning the underlying mechanism. These findings suggest that an initial description of a phenomenon should hint at a mechanism even if the mechanism would be learned only later.

AB  - This narrative project used rhizomatic analysis and reflexivity to describe a layered process of responding to a student's identity of non-participation within an undergraduate science classroom. Mapping rhizomes represents an ongoing and experimental process in consciousness. Rhizomatic mapping in educational studies is too often left out of the products of academic pursuits. In this paper, we try to capture this process, and let the process capture us. This manuscript starts with a focus on just one student, but maps our reflexive terrain that helped us think in new ways about persistent problems in science learning. As we decided how to address this student's identity of non-participation, we learned about the intertwined stories of the researchers and the researched and the challenges of designing inclusive learning environments.

AB  - The American Chemical Society-Examinations Institute (ACS-EI) released the first ACS Foundations of Inorganic Chemistry Examination in 2016 to better address the two generalized types of inorganic chemistry courses (i.e., at the foundation or second/third-year level and the indepth or third/fourth-year level). The ACS Inorganic Chemistry Exam that has traditionally been offered addresses the content and skills most associated with a third/fourth-year level course. Topics selected for the foundations level exam were informed by a national survey of inorganic chemistry faculty; however, the topical framework for the survey study was notably different from the test architecture employed by ACS Exams (i.e., the Anchoring Concepts Content Map). We should note that when the foundations level exam was being developed, the Inorganic Chemistry Anchoring Concepts Content Map was not completed; however, now that the ACCM framework has been finalized, there is an opportunity to consider how the foundations and in-depth level examinations differ based on the content map. This study, therefore, compares content coverage of the 2016 ACS Foundations of Inorganic Chemistry Examination and the 2014 ACS Inorganic Chemistry Examination. Exam items were aligned using the Big Ideas and Enduring Understanding levels of the Anchoring Concepts Content Map (ACCM) and were also evaluated based on complexity. This work demonstrates the notable differences in the two examinations by content; this work also provides a structure for faculty or instructors to use when aligning test items or learning objectives from different courses and a discussion on how to utilize the results of those alignments.

AB  - Student interaction at a whole-class level is tied to learning outcomes, but encouraging students to engage with their peers at a whole-class level is difficult. While little research has sought to promote student engagement with one another at this level, one factor that has been shown to increase student interaction in pairs and small groups is student--student interdependency. Yet, to date, no studies have attempted to examine the impact of prior interdependency at this smaller scale on students' interactions as a whole-class. The current study tested this relationship in an undergraduate class learning science content (n = 19) through structuring interdependency (task and resource) during science learning. Students completed six science learning sessions each of which included a science learning activity followed by a whole-class concept mapping task. Students were audio and video recorded during the whole-class task, and then individual student behavior was coded in 10 s intervals during the first 10 min of each session. Generalized regression results showed that adding small group interdependency during learning predicted significantly more student science discussion (R[superscript 2] = 0.05) and supportive interactions (R[superscript 2] = 0.16), while predicting decreased expressions of science misunderstanding (R[superscript 2] = 0.07) during the whole-class task. Additionally, the combination of task and resource interdependency predicted a further decrease in student expressions of misunderstanding (R[superscript 2] = 0.07), but also increased student social distraction in comparison to task interdependency alone (R[superscript 2] = 0.28). Together these findings suggest that prior interdependency can be leveraged to increase student behavioral engagement at the whole-class level.

AB  - This study evaluates the use of an open-ended question to determine students' knowledge structure on the topic of galvanic cells. The open-ended question was developed and administered to 163 Grade 10 students who had earlier completed a course on electrochemistry. Students' responses were marked as well as coded on the basis of the fields identified from their responses. This was then evaluated statistically to determine the collective knowledge structure of the sample of students. The knowledge structure thus mapped contains both canonical concepts and alternative conceptions (ACs). An important finding emerging from this study is that instructors need to focus student's attention on the dynamic processes involving electrons and ions during the operation of galvanic cells. In order for students to fully understand how a galvanic cell operates, they need to see the whole picture. There are three critical components that lead to students' understanding of how an oxidation-reduction reaction can generate energy and how a circuit is complete: transfer of electrons during oxidation-reduction half-reactions, flow of electrons within metals, and migration of ions in solution. Also, we found that it is possible for students to use correct chemistry concepts in an incorrect way by establishing linkages among these in an inappropriate manner. We reiterate that apart from evaluating students' ACs, it is also important to evaluate the links between the concepts and conceptions present in students' knowledge structure so that teaching can be made more effective.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine changes in the quality of science teachers' argumentation as a result of their engagement in a teacher workshop on earthquake engineering emphasizing distributed learning approaches, which included concept mapping, collaborative game playing, and group lesson planning. The participants were ten high school science teachers from US high schools who elected to attend the workshop. To begin and end the teacher workshop, teachers in small groups engaged in concept mapping exercises with other teachers. Researchers audio-recorded individual teachers' argumentative statements about the inclusion of earthquake engineering concepts in their concept maps, which were then analyzed to reveal the quality of teachers' argumentation. Toulmin's argumentation model formed the framework for designing a classification schema to analyze the quality of participants' argumentative statements. While the analysis of differences in pre- and post-workshop concept mapping exercises revealed that the number of argumentative statements did not change significantly, the quality of participants' argumentation did increase significantly. As these differences occurred concurrently with distributed learning approaches used throughout the workshop, these results provide evidence to support distributed learning approaches in professional development workshop activities to increase the quality of science teachers' argumentation. Additionally, these results support the use of concept mapping as a cognitive scaffold to organize participants' knowledge, facilitate the presentation of argumentation, and as a research tool for providing evidence of teachers' argumentation skills.

AB  - Learner-centered pedagogical methods that are based on clinical application of basic science concepts through active learning and problem solving are shown to be effective for improving knowledge retention. As the clinical relevance of biochemistry is not always apparent to health-profession students, effective teaching of medical biochemistry should highlight the implications of biochemical concepts in pathology, minimize memorization, and make the concepts memorable for long-term retention. Here, we report the creation and successful implementation of a flipped jigsaw activity that was developed to stimulate interest in learning biochemistry among medical students. The activity combined the elements of a flipped classroom for learning concepts followed by a jigsaw activity to retrieve these concepts by solving clinical cases, answering case-based questions, and creating concept maps. The students' reception of the activity was very positive. They commented that the activity provided them an opportunity to review and synthesize information, helped to gage their learning by applying this information and work with peers. Students' improved performance especially for answering the comprehension-based questions correctly in the postquiz as well as the depth of information included in the postquiz concept maps suggested that the activity helped them to understand how different clinical scenarios develop owing to deviations in basic biochemical pathways. Although this activity was created for medical students, the format of this activity can also be useful for other health-professional students as well as undergraduate and graduate students.

AB  - This study aims to conduct a detailed investigation on the effect the use of concept mapping, as an individual learning tool, has on students' success in learning the concept of gravimetric analysis. This study applies a case study research design to quantitatively examine the effect of the use of concept mapping and to conduct a detailed qualitative investigation of the participants' opinions about its use. In this study, the concept maps were used both as a data collection tool [Select and fill in the nodes (SAFIN); Select and fill in the lines (SAFIL); Create and fill in the lines (CAFIL); Select and fill in the nodes & lines (SAFIN&L)] and as an individual learning tool. For data triangulation, students' opinions on the concept mapping technique, as an individual learning tool for understanding gravimetric analysis, were also taken. Results from the study showed that there were significant differences between the pre- and post-test scores on all the tests (four types of fill-in-the-blank concept maps and a concept test) in favor of the post-test scores. In other words, the use of the concept map resulted in an increase in the success of the students. Furthermore, the participants expressed very positive opinions about the concept maps as an individual learning tool, both on the attitude scale and in their written opinions, declaring that it has a definite boosting effect on successfully learning a concept.

AB  - Creativity has become an increasingly important competence in today's rapidly changing times, because economics and industries depend on innovation. Creativity is therefore a requirement for school graduates, especially for the ones who strive to pursue a technical or scientific career. But creativity has not been integrated into the curricula of STEM subjects in many European countries like Germany. To successfully integrate it in the classroom, it is important to investigate teachers' views and conceptions on creativity, because they have an influence on teaching and lesson planning. This is the purpose of this study. To investigate the views and conceptions, a research instrument especially designed for this study is used. It includes the creation of two concept maps and filling out a questionnaire. The study was carried out using fifteen German chemistry teachers. The evaluation of the data was made qualitatively as well as quantitatively. It has revealed that almost all of the teachers in this study had a positive attitude towards creativity and had experiences referring to integrating creativity into their own chemistry lessons. But not all of these experiences are good ones and there were some aspects with regard to creativity in general, where uncertainties could be identified.

AB  - The concept of structure and function is a fundamental example of a crosscutting concept found in the educational reform documents in multiple STEM disciplines. However, the terms structure and function are words used in everyday language, and their use in various disciplines may be a source of lexical ambiguity for students. Discipline-specific professional societies often define pathways of research dissemination as well as the educational expectations for students pursuing a career path related to their discipline. We investigated 16 professional societies' educational expectations related to structure and function, revealing the presence of multiple discipline-specific disambiguations. As a conservative estimate, the professional societies studied cover the collective interests of at least half of a million practitioners of these disciplines and represent the areas of biology, microbiology, biochemistry and molecular biology, ecology, botany, physiology, chemistry, mathematics, statistics, engineering, and physics. The nature of this crosscutting concept and its discipline-specific uses are a potential learning challenge for students. This work provides an overview of the use of structure and function in multiple STEM disciplines from which instructors can contextualize their teaching.

AB  - Some research findings showed that Indonesian students' critical thinking skills below average, especially those who have a low academic ability; even though that skills are needed to face this 21st century. There should be a strategy to train students to develop their critical thinking, one of them is by implementing an appropriate learning model. One of the alternatives is Reading-Concept Map-Timed Pair Share (Remap-TmPS) model. This study aimed to find out the effect of Remap-TmPS model and students' different academic ability towards their critical thinking skills on Biology. This research was conducted in Senior High Schools in Batu, East Java, Indonesia. Pretest-Posttest Nonequivalent Control Group Design was employed in this study and 116 students were involved as the participants. There were two experimental classes taught using Remap-TmPs and two control classes taught as well by using conventional learning. Data on students' critical thinking skills were collected using an essay test. The results of the test were assessed using the critical thinking skills' scoring rubric and an ANACOVA test. The research finding showed that students who have the low academic ability in Biology learning who taught by using Remap-TmPS have equal critical thinking skills or the same as students' who have high academic ability who taught by using conventional learning. So, learning Biology using Remap-TmPS can be used as an alternative for students' who have a low academic ability in order to enhance their critical thinking skills.

AB  - A concept map is a node-link diagram in which each node represents a concept and each link identifies the relationship between the two concepts it connects. We investigated how using concept maps influences learning by synthesizing the results of 142 independent effect sizes (n = 11,814). A random-effects model meta-analysis revealed that learning with concept and knowledge maps produced a moderate, statistically significant effect (g = 0.58, p < 0.001). A moderator analysis revealed that creating concept maps (g = 0.72, p < 0.001) was associated with greater benefit relative to respective comparison conditions than studying concept maps (g = 0.43, p < 0.001). Additional moderator analyses indicated learning with concept maps was superior to other instructional comparison conditions, and was effective across science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and non-STEM knowledge domains. Further moderator analyses, as well as implications for theory and practice, are provided.

AB  - The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to explore the effect of within-gender and cross-gender team argumentation on seventh graders' science knowledge and argumentation skills in a computer-assisted learning environment in the United States. A total of 58 students were engaged in the collaborative within-gender team argumentation process (the treatment condition), while 46 students were engaged in the collaborative cross-gender team argumentation process (the control condition). Verbal collaborative argumentation was recorded and the students' post essays were collected. There were no statistically significant differences in science knowledge between the treatment and control conditions either for the combined set of students, or for females and males considered separately. For the combined set of male and female students, MANOVA indicated no statistically significant within-gender/cross-gender team argumentation differences in argumentation skills. Similarly, no significant within-gender/cross-gender team argumentation differences were observed among females. However, this study found a marginally significant difference in argumentation skills between male students in the within-gender team argumentation (treatment condition) and male students in the cross-gender team argumentation (control condition). A qualitative analysis was conducted to examine how the computer-assisted application supported students' development of argumentation skills in within-gender and cross-gender team argumentation. Female teams, regardless of within-gender or cross-gender team argumentation, demonstrated balanced participation in the construction of argumentation maps in the application. Male teams in within-gender team argumentation (the treatment condition) demonstrated unbalanced participation in the construction of argumentation maps in the application.

AB  - The aim of this research was to reveal the relationship between student's reading interest and critical thinking skills through Reading Concept Map Group Investigation (Remap GI) and Reading Concept Map Jigsaw (Remap Jigsaw) learning models. To do so, two science classes from first grade of two Senior High Schools in Malang, Indonesia were selected as the participants of the study. They were given the reading interest questionnaire and critical thinking skills essay test after thought by two different learning models. The obtained data were analyzed through Pearson Product Moment Coefficient of Correlation and doing a statistical regression analysis. The result revealed that there was no correlation between two variables both in Remap GI or Remap Jigsaw class. Because of no correlation between two variables was found, two variables were compared through Remap GI and Remap Jigsaw using descriptive analysis. The finding of this study has some implications for teachers to consider some aspect or skills from students and their relationship with each other. So the teacher can predict what needs to be developed and how to do it.

AB  - The concept of energy is of central significance, as it is a core disciplinary idea in chemistry and a cross-cutting concept in the sciences. This study sought to investigate student understanding of energetics and associated thermodynamic functions in chemical reactions and processes across a sample of introductory-level undergraduate chemistry students, upper-level undergraduate chemistry students, and physical chemistry graduate students. Participants were interviewed using an interview-about-events protocol, interacting with reagents that underwent chemical reactions or dissolutions. Analysis of the interview data revealed specific student difficulties with content, as well as common reasoning patterns used by students when considering energy changes in observed reactions and processes. Implications for curriculum and instruction are discussed.

AB  - How, when and what kind of learning takes place are key questions in all educational environments. School graduates are expected to have reached a development level whereby they have, among many fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, to plan their studies and their future, and to integrate knowledge across disciplines. However, it is challenging to develop these skills in schools. Following existing curricula, disciplines are often taught separately and by different teachers, making it difficult for students to connect knowledge studied and learned from one discipline to that of another discipline. The Next Generation Science Standards on teaching and learning natural science in the United States point out important crosscutting concepts in science education (NGSS, 2013). In Estonia, similar trends are leading to an emphasis on the need to further develop scientific literacy skills and interdisciplinary learning in students. The changing environment around us must be reflected in changes in our school system. In this paper, we report on research that intends to answer the questions: (a) "How much do Estonian students develop an interdisciplinary understanding of science throughout their high school education?", and (b) "Is their thinking more interdisciplinary after two years of studies in an Estonian high school?" Additionally, we analyzed the results based on the type of school the students attended, and we examined the use concept mapping to assess interdisciplinary learning. This research is part of an overall study that involved students from 44 Estonian high schools taking a science test similar to the three-dimensional Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test (hereafter called PISA-like multidimensional test) as well as constructing concept maps, while in 10th and 12th grade. In this paper, we report on the analysis of the results for 182 of the students, concentrating on the analysis of the concept maps they constructed. The results suggest that there were changes in the students' interdisciplinary knowledge, but these were small and varied depending on the students' school type. They also suggest that changes may be needed in the Estonian educational system to increase the students' level of interdisciplinary understanding of science.

AB  - Project-based learning (PBL) is an instructional approach to science teaching that supports the "Next Generation Science Standards" (Krajcik 2015; NGSS Lead States 2013). In a PBL lesson, students design and solve real-world problems or explain scientific phenomena. Students using a PBL model learn and retain more than those not using PBL (Krajcik and Shin 2014). At the core of PBL is the open-ended "driving question." The driving question guides all learning tasks inside and outside the classroom, supports and inspires students' curiosity while learning more about the phenomena being explored, and culminates in the creation of a final artifact. The driving question board (DQB) serves as a visual organizer for PBL units (Weizman, Schwartz, and Fortus 2008). Teachers use the DQB to display the driving question to remind students of the goal of the unit's investigations. Students write their own questions and comments about the driving question, the phenomena, or anything that arises from subsequent investigations on the DQB. Using sticky notes for this means students' questions, categories, and groupings can be easily added, revised, or moved as more information is acquired during the unit. This article introduces an additional tool, the activity summary board (ASB) (Figure 1). The ASB is a classroom organizational tool that summarizes what students do and figure out in the classroom as they take on the role of scientist or engineer to make sense of the phenomenon or problem. The ASB augments the DQB: Student questions that have been investigated and answered are physically removed from the DQB and then placed on the "Question" side of the ASB (Figure 1). Thus, the ASB provides a visual representation of the students' progress in making sense of the phenomenon. A two-week physics unit in a classroom of one of the authors illustrates use of the DQB and the ASB.

AB  - This study examines the tendencies of studies carried out using text mining methods under the title of "serious game". A query was run for the "serious game" keyword in the Web of Science search engine to acquire the data. The study included publications that were scanned in the SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI and A&HCI indices between 2007-2017. Information could be acquired for a total of 1431 publications. Firstly, the obtained data were cleansed of erroneous and unnecessary information by way of a pre-process. According to the data set cleansed of errors, the total number of common citations was 12701, number of citations per publication was 8.88, whereas h-index was determined as 51. Analyses were carried out by examining all "serious games" publications on the basis of: year, author, journal/symposium name, keywords, research areas and common citation parameters. According to the results, there was a continuous increase over time in the number of publications and citations. Even though "serious games" is a topic that is frequently studied in the field of education technology studies in fields such as psychology, health care sciences, environmental sciences, ecology, public environmental occupational health, rehabilitation, business economics and psychiatry shows that "serious game" is also a popular topic for studies in different disciplines.

AB  - In this paper, we present and discuss the results of a systematic review of concept mapping-based interventions in primary and secondary science education. We identified the following recommendations for science educators on how to successfully apply concept mapping as a method for formative assessment: firstly, concept mapping should be constructed in teaching, preferably on repeated occasions. Secondly, concept mapping should be carried out individually if personal understanding is to be elicited; however, collaborative concept mapping might foster discussions valuable for developing students' understanding and for activating them as instructional resources and owners of their own learning. Thirdly, low-directed mapping seems most suitable for formative assessment. Fourthly, technology-based or peer assessments are useful strategies likely to reduce the load of interpretation for the educator and are compatible with timely feedback. Finally, elaboration should be part of the feedback, activating students as the owners of their own learning.

AB  - Communication research field has an extraordinary growth pattern, indeed bigger than other research fields. In order to extract knowledge from such amount, intelligent techniques are needed. In such a way, using bibliometric techniques, the evolution of the conceptual, social and intellectual aspects of this research field could be analysed, and hence, understood. Although the communication research field has been widely analysed using bibliometric techniques and science mapping tools, a conceptual analysis of the whole communication research field is still needed. Therefore, this article introduces the first science mapping analysis in the communication research field based on the Web of Science Subject Category "Communication", showing its conceptual structure and scientific evolution. SciMAT, a bibliometric science mapping software tool based on co-word analysis and h-index, is applied using a sample of 33,627 research documents from 1980 to 2013 published in 74 main communication journals indexed in the Journal Citation Reports of the Web of Science. The results show that research conducted in the communication research is concentrated on the following sixteen disconnected thematic areas: "children", "psychological aspects", "news", "audience", "surveys", "advertising", "health", "relationship", "gender", "discourse", "telephone communication", "public relation", "telecommunications", "public opinion", "activism" and "Internet". These areas have progressively disconnected among them, which drives to a Communication field relatively fragmented.

AB  - The main aim of this article is to give an overview of how the concept of social justice-- as linked to curricular and evaluation practices--has been developed in scientific publications over the years. To achieve this goal, a mapping study was carried out by collecting scientific publications from the Web of Science Core Collection. The analysis focused on 217 articles from 50 scientific journals. Each one of the 217 articles was analysed through the process of content analysis. From this analysis, it was possible to conclude that the concept of social justice has been developed, in the main, from a broad view of equity in which inclusion and democracy are central. However, the political agenda, externally imposed and guided by accountability and effectiveness processes, frames all actions relating to social justice issues especially in schools. Accountability and effectiveness processes shape the way that social justice is perceived by policymakers and, consequently, how the processes to achieve them are considered and implemented.

AB  - This study presents an 'education for sustainability' curricular model which promotes science learning in an elementary classroom through equity pedagogy. A total of 25 fourth-grade students from an urban, public school in Denver, Colorado participated in this mixed-methods study where concept maps were used as a tool for describing and assessing students' understanding of ecosystem interactions. Concept maps provide a more holistic, systems-based assessment of science learning in a sustainability curriculum. The concept maps were scored and analyzed using SPSS to investigate potential differences in learning gains of English Language Acquisition (ELA) and Gifted/Talented (GT) students. Interviews were conducted after the concept maps were administered, then transcribed and inductively coded to generate themes related to science learning. Interviews also encouraged students to explain their drawings and provided a more accurate interpretation of the concept maps. Findings revealed the difference between pre- and post-concept map scores for ELA and GT learners were not statistically significant. Students also demonstrated an increased knowledge of ecosystem interactions during interviews. Concept maps, as part of an education for sustainability curriculum, can promote equity by providing diverse learners with different--yet equally valid--outlets to express their scientific knowledge.

AB  - This article argues that the development of rap song lyrics or lyrical concept mapping can be a viable pedagogical alternative to the development of concept maps as a means to reinforce STEM vocabulary. Hip-hop pedagogy is a culturally responsive pedagogy that leverages the funds of knowledge acquired from hip-hop culture. Unfortunately, many students with strong hip-hop cultural identities may lack equally strong mathematics identities. Given the success of hip-hop pedagogies within the science content area, we posit that hip-hop pedagogies are appropriate in other STEM content areas such as mathematics. Concept mapping is an instructional tool that has been empirically validated as an effective means to develop strong conceptualizations of mathematics content. While hip-hop pedagogy is well established in the science content area, it remains underdeveloped within mathematics education. We argue that the lyrical structure of a rap song is fundamentally similar to the structure of a concept map. This article provides a framework to support lyrical concept mapping as a culturally responsive instructional tool that can be used as an alternative to traditional concept mapping. Special attention is placed on the use of hip-hop pedagogy to affirm and empower dually marginalized students.

AB  - The main objective of this paper is to propose a didactic framework for teaching Applied Mathematics in higher education. After describing the structure of the framework, several applications of inquiry-based learning in teaching numerical analysis and optimization are provided to illustrate the potential of the proposed framework. The framework is based on the Process of Scientific Inquiry (PoSI), while it consists of three pillars, each characterized by the use of a particular cognitive tool: Algorithm for presenting a list of steps to follow in order to solve a problem, CMAP software for constructing concept maps and MATLAB software for computer programming. In addition to this, a WebQuest Scenario can be used as an "auxiliary" cognitive tool by providing students with the opportunity to combine technology (e.g., MATLAB and CMAP software) with educational concepts (e.g., optimization), and to incorporate inquiry-based learning (i.e., PoSI). Introducing these cognitive tools to the design of the proposed didactic framework provides considerable potential of knowledge consolidation with reference to solving complex numerical problems using efficient algorithms.

AB  - Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments provide learners with multiple representational tools for storing, sharing, and constructing knowledge. However, little is known about how learners organize knowledge through multiple representations about complex socioscientific issues. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate learners' knowledge organization (KO) through multiple representations in a CSCL environment. We designed a learning unit on nuclear energy and implemented it with a group of 20 college students. The participants used a web-based hypertext KO platform that incorporated three representational modes: textual, pictorial, and concept map. The platform interlinked learners' knowledge entries based on similar keywords. Utilizing mixed methods research we analyzed the individual entries and the knowledge base to determine KO both at the individual and the collective levels. We found that the density of the knowledge base was high; the learners mostly benefited from their text- and concept map-based entries, though the picture-based entries were also an important means for connecting entries with similar content and hence creating a dense knowledge base. Our results suggest that KO with multiple representations can create a more comprehensive knowledge base. Using distinct analytical approaches will allow CSCL researchers to better identify KO both at the individual and collective levels.

AB  - The aim of the 2018 International Association for Development of the Information Society (IADIS) Cognition and Exploratory Learning in the Digital Age (CELDA) conference was to address the main issues concerned with evolving learning processes and supporting pedagogies and applications in the digital age. There have been advances in both cognitive psychology and computing that have affected the educational arena. The convergence of these two disciplines is increasing at a fast pace and affecting academia and professional practice in many ways. Paradigms such as just-in-time learning, constructivism, student-centered learning and collaborative approaches have emerged and are being supported by technological advancements such as simulations, virtual reality and multi-agent systems. These developments have created both opportunities and areas of serious concerns. This conference aims to cover both technological as well as pedagogical issues related to these developments. Main tracks have been identified. However innovative contributions that do not easily fit into these areas will also be considered as long as they are directly related to the overall theme of the conference -- cognition and exploratory learning in the digital age. The CELDA 2018 Conference received 85 submissions from more than 31 countries. Each submission was reviewed in a double-blind review process by at least two independent reviewers to ensure quality and maintain high standards. Out of the papers submitted, 37 were accepted as full papers, 20 were accepted as short papers, and 5 were accepted as reflection papers. In addition to the presentation of full, short and reflection papers, the conference also includes one keynote presentation from internationally distinguished researcher, Professor Tobias Ley, Professor for Learning Analytics and Educational Innovation, Head of the Center of Excellence in Educational Innovation, Tallinn University, Estonia. Individual papers contain figures, tables, and references. An author index is provided.

AB  - It has been determined that the drawings, photographs and pictures related to the subject of the continuity of the tangent function on page 68 of the Ministry of National Education's twelfth-grade mathematics textbook contradict principles 1, 7 and 10 of Yanpar's (2007) teaching material development principles. According to these principles, teaching materials should: i) be simple, plain, and understandable, ii) reflect real life as much as possible, and iii) be easy to develop or revise, if necessary. This study aims to develop a portable tangent bridge model to meet the needs of the subject of the continuity of the tangent function. With this aim: i) teaching with the analogies model in the design of the teaching material, ii) "this is my project" format in the development and iii) Yanpar's (2007) principles were considered. The design of the model lasted 14 weeks. At the end of the study, a portable tangent bridge model from waste products was designed and developed. This model is thought to contribute to the teaching effectiveness of teachers (Shulman, 1987) with content knowledge alongside with pedagogical knowledge (Shulman, 1986). With this contribution, the needs of the subject as described by Taba (1962) and Tyler (1949) will be met. This model will also serve as an example of meeting the needs of the subjects of knowledge and its product, technology, as highlighted by Cahit Arf (Terzioglu &Yilmaz, 2006).

AB  - This study investigated how studying a refutational map, a type of argument map, affected conceptual change. Refutational maps visually display both correct and alternative conceptions. Participants (N = 120) were randomly assigned to (1) a refutational map condition, (2) a refutational text condition, and (3) a non-refutational text condition. The post-test results showed that studying the refutational map led to better performance on free recall and learning transfer measures. Specifically, participants who studied the refutational map performed significantly better than others on a free recall test, and they significantly outperformed the non-refutational text group on a short-answer transfer test. The multiple-choice test, another transfer measure, failed to detect any differences among the three groups. The research also found that individual differences in need for cognition and logical thinking ability interacted with the type of study materials. Participants scoring lower on logical thinking ability gained more from studying the refutational map.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to introduce a case-based module teaching sustainable engineering, linking the Envision rating system with behavioral decision science. Three complete modules are publicly available in a repository for any instructor to adapt, use and review. Design/methodology/approach: A case study was written about the Tucannon River Wind Farm, a project-certified Gold by the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure's Envision™ rating system. The case was used as the basis for an in-class PowerPoint module to achieve student learning outcomes related to sustainability. Findings: Before and after surveys showed significant (p < 0.05) learning increases. Word clouds show changes in student perceptions of sustainable design. Rubric scoring of writing assignments and concept maps yielded valuable insights and improvements and demonstrated the overall validity of the module approach. Research limitations/implications: Modules lasting only one or two class days must be well-integrated into courses and curricula to promote greater learning value. Concept mapping may be a useful addition but involves a learning curve for both instructors and students. Practical implications: By offering instructors access to a set of case-based modules, it becomes more practical for them to teach about sustainable infrastructure and decision-making. Social implications: The module exemplifies a project owner and an engineering firm strongly committed to social and environmental sustainability. Envision's Quality of Life and Leadership categories emphasize community well-being, involvement and collaboration. Originality/value: This module offers a unique transdisciplinary focus meeting several needs in engineering education on sustainability, complex problems and decision-making.

AB  - M3CA is a model of mastery learning developed in a college classroom, and an acronym for Mastery, Concept Maps, Critical Thinking, Collaboration and Assessment. The M3CA model is a formative model of skill based mastery learning and assessment that produces high levels of academic achievement and empowers students with a feeling of fairness. Mastery is based on students' creation of concept maps, and the steps toward mastery include learning the skills of: critical thinking, prioritization (evaluation), individual and group synthesis, group evaluation (prioritization), and the application of multiple choice items to assess the facts, concepts and knowledge embedded in the concept maps. Multiple choice items created by and collected from teams of students are available for all to see and used in their assessment. Each step toward mastery is observable, transparent, and open to public view by the students.

AB  - A wide range of opinions exist regarding the science of social work, yielding a challenging discourse to navigate in its entirety. Yet understanding the diverse perspectives and contributions is critical for doctoral students of social work. This teaching note describes the use of concept mapping as a pedagogical method employed by a class of doctoral students and their instructor to articulate the various points of view expressed in the recent literature. We begin with a brief overview of concept mapping, followed by a description of our four-stage methodology. This teaching note offers a brief conclusion that remarks on the value of the exercise and its potential in social work education.

AB  - One of the tools that indicate the relationship between concepts is the volume of concept. Volume of concept is displayed that the relations between the concepts of the subject are exhibited in a meaningful harmonious and circular manner in a certain order. The purpose of this research; to be able to determine the usefulness volume of concept, from association tools of concept, in educational process. A mixed method was used in this study. Frequency and percentage values were calculated using comparative samples in the quantitative aspect of the study. In the qualitative aspect of work was used structured interview form, face to face interviews which were identified to code-categories and analyzed the data. As a result of the work, students had difficulty in drawing the volume of concept but they had expressed that the volume of concept was clearer. Moreover, it was determined that the rate of preference volume of concept during the exam was low. It can be said that use of the ready-made form of the volume of concept was increases although a small proportion of students prefer concept volume when presented in the same way with another tools. Various suggestions have been made as a result of the research.

AB  - Meeting Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce demands require students to have positive attitudes and persist through the STEM pipeline. There is limited research on reliable and valid instruments that measures non-cognitive skills towards all STEM fields. Tools that have been developed have mostly used traditional scale development process of literature review on current instruments, expert and target group consultations, and peer review to develop and guide the conceptual domain. While this is a well-established and validated approach, it does not, however, build on the ideas of the various stakeholders (educators, researchers, professionals, students, and parents) that are involved at improving the STEM pipeline. Additionally, existing tools primarily use classical test theory (CTT) and factor analysis methods for validation. A structured methodology of Concept Mapping (Trochim, 1989a) was used in this study to develop the conceptual domain of attitudes and persistence via a participatory framework. This involved the STEM community from engagement to participation in research ranging from consultation, to involvement, and to collaboration, to develop the attitude and persistence towards STEM (APT-STEM) instrument. The instrument was validated across the quantitative psychometric frameworks of CTT, item response theory (IRT), and Rasch measurement theory (RMT). The entire study employed the exploratory quantitative priority sequential mixed methods design. In the first concept mapping phase, a total of 190 different STEM stakeholders built an item pool of 699 attitude ideas and 674 persistence ideas. With the use of nested and parallel sampling of a subset of the initial stakeholder group, these ideas went through a structured and rigorous qualitative and quantitative analysis. The resulting concept maps organized the stakeholder's conceptualization of the attitude and persistence constructs. Using qualitative and psychometric techniques, a total of 30 items were selected and refined to form the APT-STEM instrument. In the second quantitative phase of validation, APT-STEM was administered to 556 grade 5-12 students from different STEM programs who were a representative sample of the student stakeholder group. The data was analyzed using the psychometric frameworks with IRT and RMT contributing to more diagnostic details about the instrument compared to CTT. The instrument thus developed has items that were different from existing instruments. Stakeholder's conceptualized responsibility, making sacrifices, and continued practice as characteristics of a persistent student who would do well in STEM. Some attitudes that stakeholders conceived as essential were going above and beyond the classroom in pursuit of STEM learning and a belief that STEM helps develop critical thinking skills. Implications for this study include STEM programs at the middle and high school level using this instrument to assess the efficacy of the STEM education programs that change the attitudes and develop persistence towards learning and doing STEM and triggering conversations in classrooms focused on STEM careers and collaborations with STEM professionals.

AB  - In this study, the use of concept cartoons in a particle structure of matter unit was investigated using the flow map of 7th-grade students' academic achievement. The development of their cognitive structures and thoughts about concept cartoons was analyzed. 27 experimental and 27 control group students who were studying in the 7th grade participated in this research. The model of the study was "pre-test post-test control group model" from the experimental research models. Achievement test and concept cartoons developed by the researcher were used as data collection tools. As a result of this research, it was found that there was a difference between the post-test average scores in favor of the experiment group. The cognitive structures of the students were analyzed by the flow map technique, and there was a significant difference between the pre-test and post-test mean scores of the control group in the obtained data, but there was no significant difference in the correctness parameter. In the experimental group, there was a significant difference in the mean scores of size, integratedness, correctness, and richness parameters. When the opinions of the students on the use of concept cartoon were examined, it was revealed that the cartoons were thoughtful, funny, deficient in information, and different from each other. When the literature was examined, no research investigated the effect of concept cartoons on the academic achievement and cognitive structures of students and tried to reveal the cognitive structures of learners in a concrete way using flow map, which makes this study important.

AB  - Teaching Experimental Sciences is a compulsory subject in the Bachelor's Degree in Primary Education (BDPE). It belongs to the discipline of Education and to the field of "Knowledge of the social and natural environment", and consists of a total of 24 ECTS, of which 6 ECTS correspond to "Teaching Natural Sciences" (TNS). This subject is taught in the second half of the second year of the BDPE. The aim of this work has been the presentation of this subject as a Knowledge Model (KM) including interlinked Concept Maps (CCMM) with different levels of deepness of the developed topics; and to check if this new way of presentation has a positive effect on students' satisfaction towards the learning and teaching process (LTP) by inquiring about the meaningful learning and coherency of the contents by using CCMM. Results show although it is difficult to change from the comfort zone at the beginning, when students start using Cmap Tools for creating their own Knowledge Models, they finish learning meaningfully and understanding better the whole subject, find it easier to study for the evaluation and get to the domain of Knowledge by reaching basic, general and specific skills.

AB  - Teachers are not always aware of how the classroom design influences teaching, particularly in many family and consumer sciences (FCS) classes that require studio space, such as apparel and interior design classes. The purpose of this paper is to introduce strategies to assess studio spaces that are designed for enhancement of student learning. Three primary methodologies to assess the physical learning environment were employed: charrette, behavioral mapping, and focus group. The three methods helped identify issues with the classroom design that may affect quality of learning.

AB  - Compared to text, diagrams are superior in their ability to structure and summarize information and to show relations between concepts and ideas. Perceptual cues, like arrows, are expected to improve the retention of diagrams by guiding the learner towards important elements or showing a preferred reading sequence. In our experiment, we analyzed how students studied four different versions of informationally equivalent, but differently organized matrix diagrams on personality disorders. The diagram consisted of four header cells on top and four on the left, organizing the content into 16 body cells around four types of personality disorders and four categories within each type. Arrows connected the cells either from left to right or top-down. Participants were 81 university students. We found that the participants mainly studied the diagram based on the four types of personality disorders and that the arrows did not guide initial reading behavior. A post-test with retention questions showed that the participants performed better on the questions that focused on types than on the questions that focused on categories, regardless of the condition they were in. Our study has shown that in matrix diagrams the conceptual information guided reading behavior more than the orientation of the diagram and perceptual cues.

AB  - In inquiry-based learning, teachers usually only apply one level of inquiry from the four available levels. The diversity of students should be a serious consideration. Differentiated Learning Science Inquiry (DSI) implements the four levels of inquiry. To train students' creative thinking, inquiry can be integrated with mind maps. This research aims to determine the difference in creative thinking skills between male and female students who were given three different science learning models i.e., DSI, DSI integrated with mind map (DSIMM), and the conventional model. This research was a quasi-experimental research, which used a nonequivalent pretest post-test control group design. The samples of the research were 96 students from three classes spreading across three junior high schools in Kediri, Indonesia. The data on students' creative thinking skills were taken from an essay test on science learning assessed using a creative thinking skills rubric. The results of the research showed that there was a difference in students' creative thinking skills for different models. The highest creative thinking skills were exhibited by the students taught using the DSIMM model. The results of the research also showed that there was a difference in creative thinking skills between the male and the female students. The male students had higher creative thinking skills than the female students. This was presumably because in the differences of brain anatomy affecting the students' pattern of learning and activities.

AB  - Teachers need an understanding of the nature of science (NOS) to enable them to incorporate NOS into their teaching of science. The current study examines the usefulness of a strategy for challenging or changing teachers' understandings of NOS. The teachers who participated in this study were 10 initial teacher education chemistry students and six experienced teachers from secondary and primary schools who were introduced to an explicit and reflective activity, a dramatic reading about a historical scientific development. Concept maps were used before and after the activity to assess teachers' knowledge of NOS. The participants also took part in a focus group interview to establish whether they perceived the activity as useful in developing their own understanding of NOS. Initial analysis led us to ask another group, comprising seven initial teacher education chemistry students, to take part in a modified study. These participants not only completed the same tasks as the previous participants but also completed a written reflection commenting on whether the activity and focus group discussion enhanced their understanding of NOS. Both Lederman et al.'s ("Journal of Research in Science Teaching," 39(6), 497-521, 2002) concepts of NOS and notions of "naive" and "informed" understandings of NOS and Hay's ("Studies in Higher Education," 32(1), 39-57, 2007) notions of "surface" and "deep" learning were used as frameworks to examine the participants' specific understandings of NOS and the depth of their learning. The ways in which participants' understandings of NOS were broadened or changed by taking part in the dramatic reading are presented. The impact of the data-gathering tools on the participants' professional learning is also discussed.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that students often ignore molecular mechanisms when describing genetic phenomena. Specifically, students tend to directly link genes to their encoded traits, ignoring the role of proteins as mediators in this process. We tested the ability of 10th grade students to connect genes to traits through proteins, using concept maps and reasoning questions. The context of this study was a computational learning environment developed specifically to foster this ability. This environment presents proteins as the mechanism-mediating genetic phenomena. We found that students' ability to connect genes, proteins, and traits, or to reason using this connection, was initially poor. However, significant improvement was obtained when using the learning environment. Our results suggest that visual representations of proteins' functions in the context of a specific trait contributed to this improvement. One significant aspect of these results is the indication that 10th graders are capable of accurately describing genetic phenomena and their underlying mechanisms, a task that has been shown to raise difficulties, even in higher grades of high school.

AB  - Concept map (CM) is a theoretically sound yet easy to learn tool and can be effectively used to represent knowledge. Even though many disciplines have adopted CM as a teaching and learning tool to improve learning effectiveness, its application in IS curriculum is sparse. Meaningful learning happens when one iteratively integrates new concepts and propositions into her existing cognitive structure. It is the process of how one acquires deep and applicative knowledge in certain domains such as Information Systems (IS). As important as meaningful learning is in IS education, there is a scarcity of method to assess it effectively. This study reports a series of experiments of adopting CM as a tool to enhance and evaluate students' learning, especially meaningful learning in IS education. Based on theoretical foundation of CMs and prior related empirical work, we designed a series of assignments that require students to complete CMs in three participating courses. We also designed and implemented a tool to help analyzing the CMs with certain level of automation. The completed CMs are collected and analyzed to answer our research questions. We believe the results demonstrate the utility of CMs in IS education as an effective tool to understand and assess students' meaningful learning. Our work also experimented with various methods to use CMs and the findings provide valuable insights as to how CM-based teaching and learning tools can be integrated into IS curricula seamlessly.

AB  - The adoption of active learning instructional practices in college science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses has been shown to result in improvements in student learning, contribute to increased retention rates, and reduce the achievement gap among different student populations. Descriptions of active learning strategies have been reported in other disciplines; however, the research literature that documents the success of these strategies may be unfamiliar to many geoscience instructors. This literature review seeks to serve as a bridge that connects the reflective practitioner, the research literature on instructional strategies, and the network of community resources available to the geoscience educator. We review the characteristics of 11 active learning strategies and weigh the evidence that these strategies improve student learning. Furthermore, we analyze the utility of these strategies in the context of their use in geoscience classrooms. We seek to provide geoscience instructors with a decision-making guide and evidence-based recommendations that they can use to select and implement active learning strategies that have the potential to enhance undergraduate learning experiences in geoscience courses.

AB  - A traditional science notebook is an official record of a scientist's research. Even in today's digital world, it is still common practice for scientists to record their experimental procedures, data, analysis, results, notes, and other thoughts on the right pages of a bound notebook in permanent ink with nothing written on the left side or back of a page. The notebook becomes an official record of scientific research. The use of a science notebook in elementary classrooms enables students to be scientists by documenting their investigations in much the same way. Each component of the inquiry and design process is recorded and communicated in their science notebook. In addition, educators have found a productive use for the left-side pages of a science notebook to better engage students in the learning process. While a traditional science notebook only uses the right page, an interactive science notebook uses the left page to facilitate interactions between students and between the student and the teacher. The teacher prompts students to document their scientific thinking on the left page, using teaching strategies such as questioning, sentence stems, concept maps, drawings, and diagrams. For example, the teacher may pose thought-provoking questions at the beginning of a lesson or unit to assess students' prior knowledge or identify misconceptions held by the students. The students' conceptions can be expressed on the left-side page in words, charts, diagrams, or drawings. After recording their own ideas in their notebook, the students are then asked to discuss their ideas about science in small groups or as a whole class. In this way, the notebook is facilitating interactions and scientific discussions within the classroom. During future lessons, the teacher can continue to use the notebook to check for understanding, which facilitates more discussion and informs the next steps of instruction. This also allows a place for students to document their thinking and changes in their thinking during the learning process. As a result, the interactive science notebook is an official record of both student thinking (on the left page) and scientific investigations (on the right page). A list of resources is provided.

AB  - Educational transformation in the 21st century demands in-depth knowledge and understanding in order to promote the development of higher-order thinking skills (HOTS). However, the most commonly reported problem with respect to developing a knowledge of chemistry is poor mastery of basic concepts. Chemistry laboratory educational activities are shown to be less effective in developing an optimum conceptual understanding and HOTS among students. One factor is a lack of effective assessment and evaluation tools. Therefore, the primary focus of this study is to explore concept maps as an assessment tool in order to move students' thinking skills to a higher level during laboratory learning activities. An embedded mixed method design is used in this study, which has also employed a pre-experimental research design. This design triangulates quantitative and qualitative data, which are combined to strengthen the findings. A low-directed concept mapping technique, convergence scoring method, and pre-post laboratory concept map were used in this study. An electrolysis HOTS test was used as the research instrument in order to measure the level of student achievement with respect to high-level questions. In addition, the thought process that is involved when students construct concept maps has been explored and studied in detail by utilising a think-aloud protocol. Results showed a positive development towards understanding and higher level thinking skills in students with respect to electrolysis concepts learned through chemistry laboratory activities. An investigation of the students' thinking processes showed that high-achieving students were more capable of giving a content-based explanation of electrolysis and engaged in monitoring activities more often while building a concept map. Nonetheless, all categories of students managed to show a positive increase in the activities of explanation and monitoring during the construction of concept maps after they were exposed to the assessment tool in the laboratory learning activities. In conclusion, the assessment activity using concept maps in laboratory learning activities has a positive impact on students' understanding and stimulates students to increase their HOTS.

AB  - Institutions have developed diverse approaches that vary in effectiveness and cost to improve student performance in introductory science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses. We developed a low-cost, graduate student-led, metacognition-based study skills course taught in conjunction with the introductory biology series at Miami University. Our approach aimed to improve performance for underachieving students by combining an existing framework for the process of learning (the study cycle) with concrete tools (outlines and concept maps) that have been shown to encourage deep understanding. To assess the effectiveness of our efforts, we asked (1) how effective our voluntary recruitment model was at enrolling the target cohort; (2) how the course impacted performance on lecture exams; (3) how the course impacted study habits and techniques; and (4) whether there are particular study habits or techniques that are associated with large improvements on exam scores. Voluntary recruitment attracted only 11-17% of our target cohort. While focal students improved on lecture exams relative to their peers who did not enroll, gains were relatively modest, and not all students improved. Further, although students across both semesters of our study reported improved study habits (based on pre and post surveys) and on outlines and concept maps (based on retrospectively scored assignments), gains were more dramatic in the Fall semester. Multivariate models revealed that, while changes in study habits and in the quality of outlines and concept maps were weakly associated with change in performance on lecture exams, relationships were only significant in the Fall semester and were sometimes counterintuitive. Although benefits of the course were offset somewhat by the inefficiency of voluntary recruitment, we demonstrate the effectiveness our course, which is inexpensive to implement and has advantage of providing pedagogical experience to future educators.

AB  - Today, the implication of Web 2.0 technologies in e-learning allows envisaging new teaching and learning forms, advocating an important place to the collaboration and social interaction. However, in e-learning systems, learn in a collaborative way is not always so easy because one of the difficulties when arranging e-learning courses can be that these courses are not adapted to this type of learning based on collaboration. In most of time, these courses are constructed individually, a way that does not stimulate collaborative and social learning. This work is at the heart of this issue. It seeks to find conceptual solutions for computer design and development of pedagogical knowledge, which should be in adequacy with current e-learning practices based on Web 2.0 features: collaborative e-learning. Thus, this paper presents a process of online and collaborative design-development of e-learning contents as concept maps, process which takes place in an online environment. The novel aspect of this approach is that the content generated following the proposed process is becoming less the product of a single author, but this is the result of a team work, and is adapted to collaborative e-learning practices. The paper describes the proposed process, presents the architecture of the implemented environment and exposes the adopted technical choices. The paper presents also the results of the experimentation of the framework in a realistic situation, which is based on the analysis of collected traces of a group of teachers (n = 30). The results found validate the interest of teachers involved toward the proposed approach.

AB  - This article describes the kindergarten unit on environmental awareness, "Who Wants to Live and Grow in a Garbage Dump?," which integrated life science, health and nutrition concepts, and relationships around the topic of "soil." Science Technology Education and Mathematics (STEM) activities used in the lesson plans were developed to help children learn about the interrelational and circular relationships between children's own health and nutrition, children's dependence on plant and animal life (life science), and how different aspects of the environment (land, water, and air) are needed to sustain animal and plant life. Preservice teachers sought to develop units that connect real-life science to children's everyday lives through inquiry and develop STEM activities where young children observe the life patterns that animals and plants use to survive (NGSS Lead States 2013).

AB  - This study focuses on how teachers learn to teach a new topic and the role played by their developing content knowledge as they teach. The paper is based on seven high school science teachers' studies on the teaching of semiconductors, at the time a new topic in the curriculum. Analysis of artefacts such as teacher concept maps, video recordings of lessons, journals and other classroom-based evidence shows how the extent and type of teachers' content knowledge informed their choice of teaching approaches and how their learning of content took place alongside the development of teaching strategies. The development of content knowledge was combined with increased understanding of how to teach the topic in almost all cases. Evidence of development of teachers' PCK was found in their increased ability to design teaching strategies, and their use of representations and suitable assessment tasks for their lessons. Some specific common teaching strategies were identified across the teachers. These strategies could add to the canon of teachers' topic-specific professional knowledge for semiconductors. The study provides increased understanding of how teachers simultaneously master content and its teaching and how mediated self-reflection is a fruitful approach for assisting teachers to learn to teach a new topic.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) uses concepts that are essential to computing and information science to solve problems, design and evaluate complex systems, and understand human reasoning and behavior. This way of thinking has important implications in computer sciences as well as in almost every other field. Therefore, we contend that CT should be taught in elementary schools and included in every university's educational curriculum. Several studies that measure the impact of teaching programming, analytical thinking, and CT have been conducted. In this review, we analyze and discuss findings from these studies and highlight the importance of learning programming with a focus on the development of CT skills at a young age. We also describe the tools that are available to improve the teaching of CT and provide a state-of-the-art overview of how programming is being taught at schools and universities in Colombia and around the world.

AB  - This study explored the effectiveness of different concept mapping techniques on the learning achievement of senior accounting students and whether achievements attained using various techniques are affected by different learning styles. The techniques are computer-assisted construct-by-self-concept mapping (CACSB), computer-assisted construct-on-scaffold concept mapping (CACOS), paper-and-pencil concept mapping (PAP), and traditional textbook exercise (TTE) methods. A pretest-posttest control group design was employed. The subjects were 151 students who were taking an advanced accounting course. An analysis of covariance was used to analyze the results. The research findings are fourfold: (1) the two computer-assisted concept mapping techniques (CACSB and CACOS) are more beneficial to students' learning achievement than PAP and TTE; (2) PAP is better than TTE in relation to students' learning achievement; (3) when students' different learning styles were taken into account, CACOS offers better assistance to students who have accommodating and converging learning styles, followed by CACBS, PAP, and TTE; (4) for students who have assimilating and diverging learning styles, CACSB has the most significant effects on their learning achievement, followed by CACOS, PAP, and TTE. The computer-assisted concept mapping technique needs to fit learners' learning styles. The match between learning styles and learning techniques will further enhance learning achievement.

AB  - Online discussions have become inherent components of both face-to-face and distance education college courses, yet they often fail to provide much benefit to students' learning outcomes. One reason behind this phenomenon is the lack of or inadequate scaffolding or guidance provided to students when participating on asynchronous discussion boards. Although some existing tools and strategies may encourage meaningful academic discussions by eliciting conflict among students, scientific concepts do not always lend themselves to such discourse. Instead, collaborative activities in the area of science need to incorporate the co-critiquing of a flawed external source, with appropriate scaffolding to also benefit students with low self-regulation levels by mediating cognitive and metacognitive processes. The authors designed and tested such a tool, termed Collaborative Misconception Mapping (CMM), which combines the positive effects of concept mapping and the Questioning the Author comprehension strategy. Compared with a discussion-questions based online activity, the use of the online CMM strategy lead to more meaningful discussions, as well as increased knowledge of basic statistical concepts.

AB  - This study aimed to discover subject-specific science teachers' views of alternative assessment. The questionnaire by Okur (2008) was adapted and deployed for data collection. The sample consisted of 80 subject-specific science teachers drawn from the cities of Trabzon, Rize and Erzurum in Turkey. In analyzing data, descriptive analysis was employed for identifying how often the subject-specific science teachers use the alternative assessment and which of the alternative assessment techniques are frequently preferred. Also, how gender variable affects their preference and/or self-competency was analyzed via independent samples t-test. In light of the results, it can be deduced that the subject-specific science teachers tended to use such traditional assessment techniques as multiple choice test, concept map, written test, and matching test. Further, the main barrier to involve the alternative assessment in science classes seems to be the high-staking nation-wide exams in Turkey that deploy only multiple-choice questions. Therefore, any change in assessment strategy of the high-staking nation-wide exams may foster teachers to enrich their preferences of alternative assessment and empower its possible use in science classes.

AB  - Spatial visualization is a well-established topic of education research that has allowed improving science and engineering students' skills on spatial relations. Connections have been established between visualization as a comprehension tool and instruction in several scientific fields. Learning about dynamic processes mainly relies upon static spatial representations or images. Visualization of time is inherently problematic because time can be conceptualized in terms of two opposite conceptual metaphors based on spatial relations as inferred from conventional linguistic patterns. The situation is particularly demanding when time-varying signals are recorded using displaying electronic instruments, and the image should be properly interpreted. This work deals with the interplay between linguistic metaphors, visual thinking and scientific instrument mediation in the process of interpreting time-varying signals displayed by electronic instruments. The analysis draws on a simplified version of a communication system as example of practical signal recording and image visualization in a physics and engineering laboratory experience. Instrumentation delivers meaningful signal representations because it is designed to incorporate a specific and culturally favored time view. It is suggested that difficulties in interpreting time-varying signals are linked with the existing dual perception of conflicting time metaphors. The activation of specific space-time conceptual mapping might allow for a proper signal interpretation. Instruments play then a central role as visualization mediators by yielding an image that matches specific perception abilities and practical purposes. Here I have identified two ways of understanding time as used in different trajectories through which students are located. Interestingly specific displaying instruments belonging to different cultural traditions incorporate contrasting time views. One of them sees time in terms of a dynamic metaphor consisting of a static observer looking at passing events. This is a general and widespread practice common in the contemporary mass culture, which lies behind the process of making sense to moving images usually visualized by means of movie shots. In contrast scientific culture favored another way of time conceptualization (static time metaphor) that historically fostered the construction of graphs and the incorporation of time-dependent functions, as represented on the Cartesian plane, into displaying instruments. Both types of cultures, scientific and mass, are considered highly technological in the sense that complex instruments, apparatus or machines participate in their visual practices.

AB  - This article presents the use of personal professional theories (PPTs) in Dutch higher vocational education. PPTs are internalised bodies of formal and practical knowledge and convictions that professionals use to direct their behaviour. With the aid of high-quality representations of students' PPTs teachers can access, monitor, and support the professional development of students. Two qualitatively equivalent techniques for representing PPTs are (computer-supported) concept mapping and interviewing. The article reports on a study of the effects of combining these techniques to determine whether (1) this results in higher quality representations and (2), if so, whether technique order will make a difference. The study was conducted in two very different vocational domains: accountancy with 29 participants and teacher education with 20 participants. The results of a counterbalanced quasi-experiment with two factors (i.e. domain and order) show in both domains that combining the techniques improves quality but that the order in which the techniques are applied does not matter. This order independence has practical importance as the combination of first conducting a computer-supported analysis of a student generated concept map and subsequently discussing the results with the student, fosters learning and is well suited to educational practice.

AB  - Creativity has become an increasingly important competence in today's rapidly changing times, especially for school graduates who strive for pursuing a technical or scientific career. But creativity has not been integrated in the lessons or curricula of STEM subjects. To successfully integrate it in the classroom, it is important to investigate teachers' and student teachers' views on creativity. A study with seventeen German student teachers, studying chemistry on a Master's degree, is already carried out using a new research instrument that includes the creation of concept maps and filling out a questionnaire. The implementation of this study, the analysis and evaluation of the data and a comparison with literature data are described in this article. One result of this study is that the methods are an adequate approach to investigate views and knowledge about creativity. Regarding this, all of the students already had conceptions, views and an understanding about creativity in general and in the context of chemistry education, although they did not get input on the topic. Furthermore, almost all of the students had a positive attitude towards creativity and its integration in chemistry lessons. However, also uncertainties like the definition of creativity could be identified.

AB  - Research on mechanistic thinking in organic chemistry has shown that students attribute little meaning to the electron-pushing (i.e., curved arrow) formalism. At the University of Ottawa, a new curriculum has been developed in which students are taught the electron-pushing formalism prior to instruction on specific reactions--this formalism is part of organic chemistry's language. Students then learn reactions according to the pattern of their governing mechanism and in order of increasing complexity. If students are fluent in organic chemistry's language, they should have lower cognitive load demands when learning new reactions, and be better positioned to connect the three levels of chemistry's triplet (i.e., Johnstone's triangle). We developed a qualitative research protocol to explore how students use and interpret the mechanistic language. Twenty-nine first-semester organic chemistry students were interviewed, in which they were asked to (1) explain a mechanism, given all the starting materials, intermediates, products, and electron-pushing arrows, (2) draw in arrows for a reaction mechanism, given the starting materials and products of each step, and (3) predict the product of a reaction step, given the starting materials and electron-pushing arrows for that step. To investigate the students' ideas about mechanistic language rather than their knowledge of specific reactions, we selected reactions for the interview guide that had not yet been taught. Following transcription, we analyzed the interviews using constant comparative analysis to explore how students used and interpreted the mechanistic language. Four categories of student thinking emerged with electron movement underlying students' thinking throughout the interviews. Herein, we discuss these categories, students' interpretation of the symbolism, connections to learning theory, and implications for teaching, learning, and research.

AB  - This study used a between-subjects experimental design to examine the effects of three different computer-based instructional strategies (concept map, refutation text, and expository scientific text) on science learning. Concept maps are node-link diagrams that show concepts as nodes and relationships among the concepts as labeled links. Refutational texts are designed specifically to elicit common misconceptions that learners typically hold about a particular topic, directly refute the misconceptions, and present scientific explanations as compelling alternatives. Expository scientific texts consist of texts that are written specifically to present correct scientific information. Sixty-seven participants were randomly assigned to study one of three computer-based presentations on climate change. The dependent measures were tests of free recall and transfer. The concept map group significantly outperformed the refutational and scientific text groups on both free recall and transfer tests. Practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Objective: Innovation will be key to the success of the Grand Challenges Initiative in social work. A structural systems framework based in system dynamics could be useful for considering how to advance innovation. Method: Diagrams using system dynamics conventions were developed to link common themes across concept papers written by social work faculty members and graduate students (N = 19). Results: Transdisciplinary teams and ethical partnerships with communities and practitioners will be needed to responsibly develop high-quality innovative solutions. A useful next step would be to clarify to what extent factors that could "make or break" these partnerships arise from within versus outside of the field of social work and how this has changed over time. Conclusions: Advancing innovation in social work will mean making decisions in a complex, ever-changing system. Principles and tools from methods that account for complexity, such as system dynamics, can help improve this decision-making process.

AB  - This study follows two groups of students (67 in all) through the 3 years of their high school biology education and examines the development of their systems thinking--specifically their models of the human body as a system. Both groups were composed of biology majors, but the students in one group also participated in a PBLbased extension program called "Medical Systems". Data was gathered by means of concept maps, which the students completed at four strategic stages of the learning process: beginning of 10th grade, end of 10th grade, end of 11th grade and end of 12th grade. At the end of the 3 year learning process, the students' showed more complex system models. They included a wider range of concepts in their maps, spanning hierarchy levels ranging from the molecular and cellular to the system level. We also found an increase in references to dynamic interactions, but this did not encourage the students to use cellular level processes when explaining phenomena that occur at the systems level. The impact of the PBL teaching method was strongly evident in the complexity of the Medical Systems program students' concept maps, which heavily emphasized "hierarchy" and "diseases" as system characteristics.

AB  - Recent developments in the field of history of chemistry have introduced new topics, challenges, and connections to a broad range of scientific, political, cultural, economic, and environmental issues. New audiences for the history of chemistry have emerged along with new topics, protagonists, spaces, and historical narratives. This paper summarizes the main results of a recent survey to map the current situation of the teaching of history of chemistry in Europe. We review how and where history of chemistry is taught in Europe, considering not only graduate students in science programs, but also other audiences such as science teachers, and the general public. This paper also provides updated information on journals, museums, and teaching resources across Europe. Finally, it considers how recent educational reforms have affected the teaching of history of chemistry, while evaluating the main risks and challenges for the discipline.

AB  - Climate change is one of the most challenging problems facing today's global society (e.g., IPCC 2013). While climate change is a widely covered topic in the media, and abundant information is made available through the internet, the causes and consequences of climate change in its full complexity are difficult for individuals, especially non-scientists, to grasp. Science education is a field which can play a crucial role in fostering meaningful education of students to become climate literate citizens (e.g., NOAA 2009; Schreiner et al., 41, 3-50, 2005). If students are, at some point, to participate in societal discussions about the sustainable development of our planet, their learning with respect to such issues needs to be supported. This includes the ability to think critically, to cope with complex scientific evidence, which is often subject to ongoing inquiry, and to reach informed decisions on the basis of factual information as well as values-based considerations. The study presented in this paper focused on efforts to advance students in (1) their conceptual understanding about climate change and (2) their socioscientific reasoning and decision making regarding socioscientific issues in general. Although there is evidence that "knowledge" does not guarantee pro-environmental behavior (e.g. Schreiner et al., 41, 3-50, 2005; Skamp et al., 97(2), 191-217, 2013), conceptual, interdisciplinary understanding of climate change is an important prerequisite to change individuals' attitudes towards climate change and thus to eventually foster climate literate citizens (e.g., Clark et al. 2013). In order to foster conceptual understanding and socioscientific reasoning, a computer-based learning environment with an embedded concept mapping tool was utilized to support senior high school students' learning about climate change and possible solution strategies. The evaluation of the effect of different concept mapping scaffolds focused on the quality of student-generated concept maps, as well as on students' test performance with respect to conceptual knowledge as well as socioscientific reasoning and socioscientific decision making.

AB  - Concept maps measured a student's understanding of the complexity of concepts, and interrelationships. Novak and Gowin (1984) claimed that the continuous use of concept maps increased the complexity and interconnectedness of students' understanding of relationships between concepts in a particular science domain. This study has two purposes; the first one was to test this claim and examine how the repeated use of concept maps affected the complexity and interconnectedness of concepts independent of science subjects in elementary school, the second one was to compare the sensitivity of the Ruiz-Primo et al. (1997), and the Novak and Gowin (1984) grading systems for concept maps. The sample group consisted of 23 students including 14 male and 9 female students. We employed paired sample t-tests to answer the research questions, and found that the scores obtained for the fifth science unit was significantly different from the first one. Also, Novak and Gowin's (1984) scoring system was better than Ruiz-Primo et al. (1997) to evaluate complexity in students' thinking except for one of the units. We conclude that concept maps have the potential to measure change in complexity and interconnectivity of concept maps. Furthermore, repeated use of concept maps has the potential to increase the complexity and interconnectedness of student concept maps, and therefore improve their understanding of science independent of science content.

AB  - This work discusses repertory grid analysis as a tool for investigating the structures of students' representations of biological concepts. Repertory grid analysis provides the researcher with a variety of techniques that are not associated with standard methods of concept mapping for investigating conceptual structures. It can provide valuable insights into the learning process, and can be used as a diagnostic tool in identifying problems that students have in understanding biological concepts. The biological concepts examined in this work are 'natural kinds': a technical class of concepts which "appear" to have invisible "essences" meaning carrying more perceptual weight than being perceptually similar. Because children give more weight to natural-kind membership when reasoning about traits, it would seem pertinent to apply such knowledge to deep-level research into how children reason in biology. The concept of natural kinds has a particular resonance with biology since biological kinds hold the distinction of being almost all natural kinds, such as when the same "stuff or thing" takes many different forms. We have conducted a range of studies using a diversity of biological natural kinds, but in this paper, we wish to explore some of the theoretical underpinnings in more detail. To afford this exploration, we outline one case-study in a small group of secondary school students exploring the concept of "equine"--that is, what is an equine? Five positive examples were chosen to engaged with by the students and one "outlier" with which to compare the construction process. Recommendations are offered in applying this approach to biological education research.

AB  - Ontologies play an important role as knowledge domain representations in technology-enhanced learning and instruction. Represented in form of concept maps they are commonly used as teaching and learning material and have the potential to enhance positive educational outcomes. To ensure the effective use of an ontology representing a knowledge domain it needs to be validated. In this paper a previously presented validation methodology for concept maps is exemplified. Two different types of concept map validity are distinguished, referring to the correctness of the concept map's content (content validity) and to the applicability of the concept map for its designated purpose (application validity), like its use in intelligent tutoring. To demonstrate the usefulness of the two validation types and approaches, they are illustrated by an empirical study. The content validity of a concept map on elementary geometry has been investigated by comparing it with empirically collected criterion maps through similarity measures. To demonstrate application validity an approach utilising methods of Knowledge Space Theory for predicting problem-solving behaviour has been applied. The obtained results show appropriate content validity as well as application validity for the given concept map and argue for the practical relevance of the proposed validation framework.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the effect of mind mapping activities on the maths and science skills of children 48 to 60 months of age. The study was designed using an experimental model with a pre-test post-test and a control group. Accordingly, the hypotheses of the study was that there would be meaningful differences in the values obtained from the pre-test and post-test scores in favor of the children working with mind maps compared to the ones who did not work with mind maps. In the examination of the development of mind maps, it was observed that as the children engaged in preparing mind maps, they used skills requiring high-level mind organization. Mind maps, which can be used in all areas of life, are believed to be supportive of children's development areas and to be an important strategy for children to adopt and experience during the time of childhood.

AB  - In this work, we present a marine ecology inquiry-based activity, implemented with 164 primary school students. The main goal was to evaluate the activity's impact on students' understanding about biodiversity and scientific procedures. We also aimed to analyse the potential use of personal meaning maps (PMMs) to assess the impact of the activity on students' ideas about the topics explored. The results revealed that fieldwork and the exploration of real data were the aspects most emphasised by all intervenient. Finally, the PMMs proved to be a good tool to evaluate the impact of activities developed outside classroom, with primary school levels.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the value of a concept map marking guide as an alternative formative assessment tool for science teachers to adopt for the topic of energy. Eight high school science teachers marked students' concept maps using an itemized holistic marking guide. Their marking was compared with the researchers' marking and the scores of a multiple-choice diagnostic test. Statistical analysis revealed that teachers evaluated students' concept maps consistently, but the concept map scores were only mildly correlated with the multiple-choice test scores. We explored what each assessment method revealed in terms of students' understanding with one student's performance as a showcase. Teachers' views on using the marking guide of concept maps as an assessment tool were also included. We discuss the value of the concept map marking guide as a formative assessment tool for science teachers to create and modify in order to encourage students' conceptual learning.

AB  - Research in computer-supported collaborative learning has indicated that conversational agents can be pedagogically beneficial when used to scaffold students' online discussions. In this study, we investigate the impact of an agile conversational agent that triggers student dialogue by making interventions based on the academically productive talk framework. An experimental activity in the context of a university course involved 72 undergraduate students who discussed online in dyads. Two conditions were compared: (a) dyads who received agent interventions while working on a learning task (treatment) and (b) dyads who worked on the same task without any agent interference (control). Utilizing a concept map created by the course instructor, the conversational agent delivered unsolicited interventions that encouraged treatment students to build on their prior knowledge, linking their current contributions to the main domain principles discussed during the course. Study findings indicate that the agent intervention mode substantially improved both individual and group learning outcomes. Evidence suggests that the agent effect on learning performance was mediated by students' explicit reasoning, which was also found to be enhanced in the treatment condition.

AB  - This study discusses the use of concept map tool as a new method for teaching translation (from English language to Arabic language). This study comprised 80 students divided into two groups. The first group was taught the new vocabulary by using the concept tool method, whereas the second group was taught the new vocabulary by the traditional method. Pre-test and test of homogeneity was administered in order to ensure the equivalence of the students. During the training, the two groups were subjected to evaluation tests (first, second and final) in which the students were asked to summarize text into a paragraph by translation. The differences between the two methods were compared by using t-test. Results of pre-test indicated that the difference between the two groups was not significant and the scores were linearly distributed. Results of students' scores between the two groups for the first exam was not significant, however, the difference between the two groups for second, final and total scores was significant. It was seen that the introduced method of text translation improves the student skills compared with the traditional method.

AB  - Context: concept Maps (CMs) enable the creation of a schematic representation of a domain knowledge. For this reason, CMs have been applied in different research areas, including Computer Science. Objective: the objective of this paper is to present the results of a systematic mapping study conducted to collect and evaluate existing research on CMs initiatives in Computer Science. Method: the mapping study was performed by searching five electronic databases. We also performed backward snowballing and manual search to find publications of researchers and research groups that accomplished these studies. Results: from the mapping study, we identified 108 studies addressing CMs initiatives in different subareas of Computer Science that were reviewed to extract relevant information to answer a set of research questions. The mapping shows an increasing interest in the topic in recent years and it has been extensively investigated due to support in teaching and learning. Conclusions: based on our results we conclude that the use of CMs as an educational tool has been widely accepted in Computer Science.

AB  - Teachers make a difference for the outcome of their students in science classrooms. One focus in this context lies on teachers' professional knowledge. We describe this knowledge according to three domains, namely (1) content knowledge (CK), (2) pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and (3) curricular knowledge (CuK). We hypothesise a positive relationship between these three domains and students' performance in science. Students' science performance was conceptualised by "system thinking" performance in the context of biology teaching. In order to test our hypothesis, we examined the relationship between the knowledge triplet CK, PCK, and CuK and students' performance. 48 biology teachers and their students (N = 1036) participated in this study. Teachers' content-related professional knowledge and students' performance were measured by paper-and-pencil tests. Moreover, we used concept maps to further assess students' performance. By specifying doubly latent models, we found a significant positive relationship between biology teachers' PCK and students' performance. On the contrary, the results reveal no relationship between CK and CuK and students' performance. These findings are discussed in respect to modelling the interrelationship of teachers' content-related professional knowledge and students' learning in science, as well as concerning their relevance for further research and teacher education programmes.

AB  - A map provides a unique view over the complex relationships of competition and complementarity between methods. It goes beyond the usual approaches to methods, namely monographic, mixed, encyclopaedic and classificatory. A diverse set of 50 social and political science methods instructors were surveyed about their specialty along 17 dimensions that are regarded as contrasting by the methodology literature. Correspondence analysis and cluster analysis were used to reveal response profiles and proximities between courses. Results show that the 'qualitative/quantitative' divide appears structuring, but not as much as is often conceived. Quantitative-oriented courses form a rather cohesive cluster whereas qualitative courses display high variability regarding empirical material, scales of observation, techniques and epistemologies. The resulting global picture accounts for more dimensions of the quickly expanding space of methods than usual typologies of methods do. We hope it will stimulate new methodological combinations and new ways of teaching methods.

AB  - Purpose: The paper aims to provide a conceptual map of how to mediate between sustainability theory and practice in higher education and how disciplinary divides can be bridged. It further looks at issues linked to knowledge views and drivers for institutional change that affect opportunities for whole institution development promoting action preparedness. Design/methodology/approach: Taking its point of departure in the University Educators for Sustainable Development report UE4SD (2014, 2015), the paper discusses ways that ideas and interaction can be mediated in higher education settings, to connect sustainability research with vocational programmes. Different options are considered and compared. Findings: Although the literature stresses both action orientation and the need for holistic transdisciplinary approaches, many institutional drivers limit opportunities for more integrating approaches. Research limitations/implications: However, while conclusions may hold for universities at an overarching level, it is likely that certain research and teaching environments have been able to transcend such barriers. Practical implications: Conceptually mapping the different forms that dialogue, interaction and flows of ideas take within higher education institutions has relevance for whole institution development for sustainability. Social implications: Importantly, producing sustainability science with relevance to practice in various professions is a fundamental condition to support accelerated transitions to sustainability at societal levels. Originality/value: The paper makes a significant contribution by focusing on concrete institutional pathways for knowledge exchange and negotiation that can support education for sustainability in higher education.

AB  - In this study, Turkish prospective elementary science teachers' understanding of photosynthesis and cellular respiration has been analysed within the contexts of ecosystem knowledge, organism knowledge and interconnection knowledge (IK). In the analysis, concept maps developed by 74 prospective teachers were used. The study was carried out with prospective teachers in their final year who were enrolled in the special teaching methods course. The results show that prospective teachers' understanding of photosynthesis, cellular respiration, energy flow and matter cycling is quite different from one another's. In addition, the present study revealed that prospective elementary science teachers showed weak understanding of energy flow and matter, cycling and cellular respiration concepts and IK category but they had strong understanding of photosynthesis concept. Prospective teachers also experience difficulties in understanding connections between macro- and microbiological systems. The study concludes with suggestions for more meaningful biology education.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of case teaching on how students learn about genetic engineering, in terms of meaningful learning and retention of learning. The study was designed as quasi-experimental research including 63 8th graders (28 boys and 35 girls). To collect data, genetic engineering achievement tests were developed by the researchers and concept maps (CMs) were used. In the study, the experimental group (n = 31) experienced case teaching, while the comparison group (n = 32) experienced ordinary teaching. To analyse the data from achievement test scores, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used. In analysis of the CMs, the number of concepts, number of connecting phrases, number of examples used in the maps and shape of the maps were determined. The analyses showed that the mean achievement scores of the groups significantly differed in favour of the experimental group. Also, retention of the learning in the experimental group was observed. The number of concepts used in CMs did not significantly differ, while the number of connecting phrases in both groups differed significantly in favour of the experimental group. In addition, the students in the experimental group changed their initial hierarchical maps into branched maps, indicating more connection to other concepts.

This study filled a gap in this field and also aimed to increase the rate of acceptance of research papers submitted by Turkish authors in foreign journals. Content Analysis method was used in this study. This study focused on recent 188 research papers published in 8 prestigious journals indexed in Social Sciences Citation Index in Turkey and in the world and they were analyzed in terms of research design, data collection tools, samples, sample size and data analysis method. The results of the study revealed that quantitative research design was predominantly used in Turkish journals while qualitative research design was mainly preferred by foreign journals. In addition, undergraduates were the focus of attention as sample group particularly in Turkish journals. This study suggested that qualitative research design should be given priority and alternative instruments like concept maps and portfolio should be used in this type of studies including observation and interviews. Moreover, experimental studies should be more focus of attention rather than administrating only one questionnaire in quantitative studies.

AB  - This article presents "concept landscapes"--a novel way of investigating the state and development of knowledge structures in groups of persons using concept maps. Instead of focusing on the assessment and evaluation of single maps, the data of many persons is aggregated and data mining approaches are used in analysis. New insights into the "shared" knowledge of groups of learners are possible in this way. Electronic collection of concept maps makes it feasible to aggregate the data of a large group of persons, which in turn favors a data mining approach to the analysis. The educational theories underlying the approach, the definition of concept landscapes, and the accompanying analysis methods are presented. Cluster analysis and Pathfinder networks are used on the aggregated data, allowing new insights into the structural configuration of the knowledge of learners. Two real-world research projects serve as case studies for experimental results. The data structures and analysis methods necessary for working with concept landscapes have been implemented as a GNU-R package that is freely available.

AB  - The authors find justification for integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in the complex problems that today's students will face as tomorrow's STEM professionals. Teachers with individual subject-area specialties in the STEM content areas have limited experience in integrating STEM. In this study, the authors investigated the conceptual changes of secondary school teachers teaching domain-specific STEM courses after a week-long professional development experience integrating earthquake engineering and domain-specific concepts. They documented and then triangulated outcomes of the experience using participating teachers' concept maps and teacher-generated written materials, respectively. Statistical comparisons of participants' concept maps revealed significant increases in their overall understanding of earthquake engineering and more accurate linkages with and among science domain-specific concepts. Content analyses of teachers' learning products confirmed the concept map analysis and also provided evidence of transfer of workshop learning experiences into teacher-designed curriculum products accurately linking earthquake engineering and domain-specific STEM content knowledge.

AB  - This article describes and provides supporting empirical evidence of a curriculum mapping strategy to aid elementary school science teachers to articulate learning goals for a given curriculum and thus build a deeper understanding of the science content embedded within the curriculum. Seven teachers used the mapping strategy to collaboratively map out the learning goals for the science kit units they use in their classrooms. Three elements of the mapping strategy, conceptualized as components of culturally mediated learning, were found to be important contributors to the teachers' understanding of the units: the physical mapping table, the construct of types of knowledge (declarative, procedural, and schematic), and the process of collaborative sense making. Through the mapping, the teachers became more able to identify the learning targets of each lesson, understand how each aspect of the unit adds to or is peripheral to the trajectory toward achieving the learning goals, and adjust their teaching practices accordingly. Implications for professional development and curriculum development are discussed.

AB  - Although studies repeatedly show both the importance of teachers' science subject matter knowledge (SMK) and the fact that teachers have limited SMK, there are few opportunities for teachers to formally enhance their understanding of science after entering the classroom. Therefore, there is significant need for teachers to develop their SMK through classroom experience. In this longitudinal study, we explore the development of new secondary science teachers' SMK by analyzing concept maps constructed in their 1st year of teaching and in their 5th year of teaching. We present a scoring system that reliably accounts for both the quality of connections and knowledge structure. Based on the findings presented, we conclude that these new chemistry teachers' SMK did not change significantly from their 1st year of teaching to their 5th year of teaching. Implications for teacher educators and future research are presented.

AB  - This work presents a proposal for the teaching-learning of the concept map technique applied to the Natural Sciences course in the second year of Compulsory Secondary Education (ESO, according to its initials in Spanish). Two sessions have been designed, one of which is an instructor-led session to learn the technique and another is a session in which the students independently create a concept map, applying what they have learned in the previous session. To determine the effectiveness of the proposal, the concept maps created by the students during the two sessions have been evaluated, the grades obtained on the assessment tests for the unit before the concept map experience have been compared to those obtained on the assessment tests for the unit carried out using this technique, and a survey was written to find out the level of student satisfaction with the training received and the usefulness of the concept map technique. The results show that more than 65% of students earned grades between 7 and 9.5 on the concept maps created independently during the two academic years in which the proposal has been implemented. The study carried out allows us to conclude that the students have learned how to create concept maps, and evidences the usefulness of the methodology used and the need to implement more sessions for the creation of concept maps in the Natural Sciences course so that this technique is transformed into a learning strategy. The students have expressed a high level of satisfaction with the training received and the tool they have learned how to use.

AB  - In this essay, traveling through the past half-century, the authors illustrate how mathematics education research shifted, theoretical, beyond its psychological and mathematical roots. Mapping four historical moments of mathematics education research onto broader paradigms of inquiry, the authors make a case for the field to take up a theoretical "identity" that refutes closure and keeps the possibilities of mathematics teaching and learning open to multiple and uncertain interpretations and analyses.

AB  - In this paper educators provide a valuable feedback in the use of concept maps in secondary education. More specifically their use in teaching dyslexic students Science. Almost 100 educators replied to an online questionnaire after they studied a set of evaluation sheets provided to them based on concept maps. We will begin with a brief presentation of the specific learning difficulty of dyslexia; following that are the main general characteristics and challenges that dyslexic students face. Also, the organization of Science classes for the dyslexic student is briefly discussed. Then information regarding concept maps is given. A presentation and quick discussion of four evaluation sheets with concept maps in the science subjects of Chemistry, Biology and Physics is performed. The main part of this paper presents the questionnaire along with a discussion regarding its results. Finally, conclusion are drawn and future work is mentioned.

AB  - This paper describes a small-scale piece of research using concept mapping to elicit A level students' understandings of particle physics. Fifty-nine year 12 (16- and 17 year-old) students from two London schools participated. The exercise took place during school physics lessons. Students were instructed how to make a concept map and were provided with 24 topic-specific key words. Students' concept maps were analysed by identifying the knowledge propositions they represented, enumerating how many students had made each one, and by identifying errors and potential misconceptions, with reference to the specification they were studying. The only correct statement made by a majority of students in both schools was that annihilation takes place when matter and antimatter collide, although there was evidence that some students were unable to distinguish between annihilation and pair production. A high proportion of students knew of up, down and strange quarks, and that the electron is a lepton. However, some students appeared to have a misconception that everything is made of quarks. Students found it harder to classify tau particles than they did electrons and muons. Where students made incorrect links about muons and tau particles their concept maps suggested that they thought they were mesons or quarks.

AB  - Misinformation and rumors have become rampant on online social platforms with adverse consequences for the real world. Fact-checking efforts are needed to mitigate the risks associated with the spread of digital misinformation. However, the pace at which information is generated online limits the capacity to fact-check claims at the same rate using current journalistic practices. Computational approaches may be a key for achieving scalable fact checking. To this end, this dissertation introduces network science and machine learning methods for fact checking by leveraging information in large knowledge bases, commonly known as knowledge graphs (KGs). We consider two variations of the fact-checking task. The first consists in assessing the truthfulness of a statement of fact as simple as a (subject, predicate, object) triple, where the subject entity is related to the object entity by the predicate relation. We show that a broad class of triples pertaining to generic relationships among entities in the real world, e.g., (Indianapolis, capitalOf, Indiana), can be checked effectively by finding a shortest path connecting their subject and object entities in the KG under appropriately designed semantic proximity metrics. We also extend this approach by considering multiple paths, following ideas from network flow theory. Evaluation on a range of facts related to entertainment, sports and more reveals that our methods are effective in discerning true statements from false ones, often outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. The second task consists in computing a relevance score that expresses the degree to which a person is associated with different professions or nationalities. For example, we wish to determine which of Scientist, Philosopher or Writer best describes Aristotle. We introduce a supervised learning approach for assessing such relevance by extracting useful features from the KG. Results show that our approach is effective, despite the limited information in the graph. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of classroom teachers who participated in a science-focused study abroad during their time as a preservice teacher and to explore how they are using their study abroad experiences in science curriculum planning and in classroom instruction. This study is guided by two research questions: 1) what are the study abroad experiences that have influenced classroom teachers; and, 2) how do classroom teachers incorporate study abroad experiences into science curriculum planning and instruction in the classroom? Participants were two in-service science teachers from schools located in the Southwestern United States. The participants were enrolled in the course, Environmental Science and Multicultural Experience for K-8 Teachers offered through the Department of Educational Leadership, Curriculum and Instruction during their time as preservice teachers. The course included a two-week study abroad component in Costa Rica. Participants spent their mornings observing a monolingual, Spanish-speaking elementary classroom followed by a faculty-led multicultural seminar. Afternoons during the study abroad experience were dedicated to field science activities such as quantifying plant and animal biodiversity, constructing elevation profiles, determining nutrient storage in soil, and calculating river velocity. Throughout the course students participated in science-focused excursions. A cross case study design was used to answer the two research questions guiding this dissertation study. Data collection included participant-created concept maps of the science experiences during the study abroad experience, in-depth interviews detailing the study abroad experience and classroom instruction, and participant reflective journal entries. Cross-case analysis was employed to explore the uniqueness of each participant's experience and commonalities between the cases. Trustworthiness was established by utilizing multiple sources of data, member checking, documenting the process of identifying themes from findings, and peer de-briefing. Four themes emerged via data analysis, they include: (1) experiencing science in Costa Rica, comprised of the categories of facilitated science experiences, collaborative grouping, and science stressors; (2) studying abroad in Costa Rica, containing the categories Costa Rica is your oyster, background of Costa Rica, foreground of Costa Rica, atmosphere of Costa Rica, and Costa Rican culture; (3) transferability of science experiences including the categories disposition of teaching, pedagogical knowledge, what you teach, and for whom you teach; and (4) the multicultural classroom made up of the categories Costa Rican classroom struggles, positive Costa Rican classroom climate, transferability of instructional approaches, and developing cultural competency. Implications for study abroad decision-makers and stakeholders are included. Additionally, recommendations for future research are also described. Preservice science teachers develop their knowledge of science, confidence to teach science, and ability to instruct students in the field of science in a multicultural classroom, as a product of science-focused study abroad opportunities.

AB  - In this study, I sought to identify differences in the views and understandings of engineering design among individuals along the learning-to-teach continuum. To do so, I conducted a comprehensive review of literature to determine the various aspects of engineering design described in the fields of professional engineering and engineering education. Additionally, I reviewed literature on the methods used in teaching engineering design at the secondary (grade 7-12) level--to describe the various models used in classrooms, even before the implementation of the "Next Generation Science Standards" (NGSS Lead States, 2013). Last, I defined four groups along the learning-to-teach continuum: prospective, preservice, and practicing teachers, as well as teacher educators. The context of this study centered around a California public university, including an internship program where undergraduates engaged with practicing mentor teachers in science and engineering teaching at local high schools, and a teacher education program where secondary science preservice teachers and the teacher educators who taught them participated. Interviews were conducted with all participants to gain insights into their views and understandings of engineering design. Prospective and preservice teachers were interviewed multiple times throughout the year and completed concept maps of the engineering design process multiple times as well; practicing teachers and teacher educators were interviewed once. Three levels of analyses were conducted. I identified 30 aspects of engineering discussed by participants. Through phenomenographic methods, I also constructed six conceptual categories for engineering design to organize those aspects most commonly discussed. These categories were combined to demonstrate a participant's view of engineering design (e.g., business focused, human centered, creative, etc.) as well as their complexity of understanding of engineering design overall (the more categories their ideas fit within, the more complex their understanding was thought to be). I found that the most commonly referenced aspects of engineering design were in line with the three main dimensions described in the "Next Generation Science Standards" (NGSS Lead States, 2013). I also found that the practicing teacher participants overall conveyed the most complex and integrated understandings of engineering design, with the undergraduate, prospective teachers not far behind. One of the most important factors related to a more integrated understanding of engineering design was having formal engineering experience, especially in the form of conducting engineering research or having been a professional engineer. Further, I found that female participants were more likely than their male counterparts to view engineering as having a human element--recognizing the need to collaborate with others throughout the process and the need to think about the potential user of the product the engineer is solving the problem for. These findings suggest that prior experience with engineering, and not experience in the classroom or with engineering education, tends to lead to a deeper, more authentic view of engineering. Finally, I close with a discussion of the overall findings, limitations of the study, potential implications, and future work.

AB  - The aim of this research is to determine what differences may exist in students' structural knowledge while using a variety of concept mapping assessments. A concept map can be used as an assessment which connects concepts in a knowledge domain. A single assessment may not be powerful enough to establish how students' new knowledge relates to prior knowledge. More research is needed to establish how various aspects of the concept mapping task influence the output of map creation by students. Using multiple concept maps and pre-instruction and post-instruction VNOS instruments during a 16-week semester, this study was designed to investigate the impact of concept map training and the impact of assessment design on the created maps. Also, this study was designed to determine what differences can be observed between expert and novice maps and if similarities and differences exist between concept maps and an open-ended assessment. Participants created individual maps and the maps were analyzed for structural complexity, overall structure, and content. The concept maps were then compared by their timing, design, and scores. The results indicate that concept mapping training does significantly impact the shape and structure complexity of the map created by students. Additionally, these data support that students should be frequently reminded of appropriate concept mapping skills and opportunities so that good mapping skills will be utilized. Changing the assessment design does appear to be able to impact the overall structure and complexity of created maps, while narrowing the content focus of the map does not necessarily restrict the overall structure or the complexity. Furthermore, significant differences in structural complexity were observed between novice and expert mappers. The fluctuations of NOS concepts identified in student created maps may suggest why some students were still confused or had incorrect conceptions of NOS, despite explicit and reflective instruction throughout the semester.

AB  - Background: Kuhn's model of science has been widely influential, but in this paper, it is argued that it is more appropriate to consider constructivist learning within science education as a research program in the sense used by Lakatos. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study offers teaching strategies and their corresponding instructional sequences based on Lakatosian Methodology, and examines the effects of a Lakatosian Conflict Map using pre-service elementary teachers' conceptual understandings of the causes of seasons. Design/Method: The Lakatosian Conflict Map was applied to concepts of seasonal change held by pre-service elementary teachers. Results: Most pre-service elementary teachers consistently protect their hard-core beliefs about seasonal change by offering auxiliary hypotheses related to earth's elliptical orbit and the tilt of its rotational axis in response to activities designed to promote conceptual change around knowledge related to the cause of the seasons. Specifically, the critical event rather than the discrepant event in the Lakatosian Conflict Map was conducted in a Lakatosian conflict group and these students were allowed to explicitly express their representations about the phenomena derived from these events. The result of this study is that instruction using the new Lakatosian Conflict Map produced more favorable outcomes in terms of conceptual change than traditional instruction. Conclusions: This research concludes that the Lakatosian Conflict Map can help science teachers and students resolve the conflicts between students' existing ideas and target scientific concepts.

AB  - Developing students' algorithmic and computational thinking is currently a major objective for primary and secondary education in many countries around the globe. Literature suggests that students face at various difficulties in programming processes, because of their mental models about basic programming constructs. Arrays constitute the first data structure students have to cope with in introductory programming courses. This paper presents the results of an empirical study on secondary education students' misconceptions and mental representations of the array data structure. Students' responses to written tasks regarding short code segments were mapped to the different levels of the SOLO taxonomy, in order to identify how students use arrays to solve programming problems. The analysis of the results showed that the majority of the students tended to manifest responses assigned to the lower SOLO levels, i.e. prestructural, unistructural and multistructural. The findings indicate that many students in the sample had incomplete or faulty representations of the array concept, which seem to be connected to their misconceptions about the programming variable concept.

AB  - This study aims to analyse prospective chemistry teachers' cognitive structures related to the subject of oxidation and reduction through a flow map method. Purposeful sampling method was employed in this study, and 8 prospective chemistry teachers from a group of students who had taken general chemistry and analytical chemistry courses were included in the study. To determine participants' cognitive structures related to the subject of oxidation and reduction, participants were asked two questions which did not guide them. Then the answers they gave to the questions were collected, and a flow map for each participant was prepared. The flow maps obtained through participants' written narratives were analysed in terms of quantitative variables used in presenting cognitive structures in quantitative statements. On examining participants' flow maps in accordance with all the quantitative variables used in presenting cognitive structures, it was found that prospective chemistry teacher 8 had the largest comprehensive cognitive structure, prospective chemistry teacher 4 had the medium comprehensive cognitive structure whereas prospective chemistry teacher 1 had the narrowest comprehensive cognitive structure. Participants' misconceptions were also determined through flow maps.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine cognitive structures and the retention of knowledge about environmental education, climate change and consumption concepts. The field of Environmental Education is increasingly including both climate change and consumption in the context of sustainability. Thus, this research is investigating the construction of cognitive structures using all three concepts. The study group consisted of 52 students (28 females and 24 males) attending the University of Minnesota Duluth, USA. A word association instrument was used for data collection. In order to evaluate the study results, the responses given about the key concepts were examined in detail. A frequency table was constructed to show which words or concepts best represented each key concept included in the instrument. Based on our findings, a frequency table and associated concept maps were generated to indicate how cognitive structures were formed about the three concepts. The findings showed that respondents generated many ideas related to the key concepts presented in the instrument. However, respondents did not appear to see the broad environmental concepts as a network of related ideas. Implications for using the word association test in the classroom are discussed.

AB  - Previous studies in Malang, Indonesia, showed that there were the failure biology learning caused by not only the low students' prior knowledge, but also biology learning model has not improved the students' critical thinking skills yet, which affected the low of cognitive learning outcomes. The learning model is required to improve students' critical thinking skills. Learning model that considered able to solve this problem is a model that combines reading, constructing concept maps, and the implementation cooperative learning type Numbered Heads Together (Remap NHT) in the classroom. This study was quasi experimental research that compared the effect of Remap NHT learning model and traditional learning in biology classroom to improve critical thinking skills at Xth grade students of senior school in Malang, Indonesia. The results showed that the implementation of Remap NHT during biology classroom showed the effect on students' critical thinking skills.

AB  - A common hypothesis is that students will more deeply understand dynamic systems and other complex phenomena if they construct computational models of them. Attempts to demonstrate the advantages of model construction have been stymied by the long time required for students to acquire skill in model construction. In order to make model construction a feasible vehicle for science instruction, the Dragoon system combined three simplifications: (1) a simple notation for models of dynamic systems, (2) a step-based tutoring system, and (3) problems that described the model to be constructed as well as the system represented by the model. In order to test whether these simplifications reduced the time for learning how to construct models while preserving the benefits of model construction over baseline instruction, three classroom studies were conducted. All studies were experiments, in that they compared classes using Dragoon to classes learning the same material without Dragoon. However, as classroom studies, they could not tightly control all sources of variation. The first study produced null results, but it compared learning across just one class period. The second study in 4 high school science classes showed that instruction based on Dragoon cost only one extra class period (about 50 min) out of 4 class periods and was more effective than the same content taught without Dragoon. A third study in 3 more high school science classes, where 2 Dragoon classes and 1 non-Dragoon class met for the same number of class periods, showed that Dragoon was more effective than the same content taught without Dragoon. The effect sizes were moderately large on both an open response test (d = 1.00) and a concept mapping task (d = 0.49). Thus, it appears that our efforts have simplified model construction to the point that it can be used in science instruction with no additional class time needed, and yet it still seems to be more effective than the same instruction done without model construction.

AB  - The responsibility for knowledge acquisition is increasingly being shifted to students though the utilization of experiential learning, teamwork, online, and flipped classroom pedagogies. Students are expected to enter the classroom prepared to engage in thoughtful knowledge application activities; however, many students have not adequately prepared, leading to minimal team contribution and learning. Readiness Assurance Testing is often implemented to help enforce student preclass preparation. These individual and group quizzing techniques can help motivate some students to keep current in the readings, but they do not assist students in learning comprehension. In order to improve learning comprehension and document preclass preparedness, an innovative note-taking method, Connected Notes, is offered as a way to assist students in recording, organizing, and connecting content in personally relevant ways. To improve comprehension and stimulate deeper levels of learning cognitive science supports the effectiveness of creating connections through multiple pathways. Students generate connections between chapter concepts and their consumer experiences, their careers, and company examples in preparation for team-based activities. Results from this study suggest the Connected Notes intervention improved the direct learning outcome (exams) while producing no negative effect on student evaluation of teaching.

AB  - This article considers what might be taught to meet a widely held curriculum aim of students being able to understand research in a discipline. Expertise, which may appear as a "chain of practice," is widely held to be underpinned by networks of understanding. Scientific research expertise is considered from this perspective. Within scientific disciplines, "how" research is conducted to solve different problems varies with concomitant effects on the validity of the data and the strengths of the claims made. Despite this variation, the overarching concepts of validity and reliability and the underpinning and interrelated network of more specific "concepts of evidence" are applicable to understanding a wide range of research designs and the uncertainties in the resultant data and claims. These constituent ideas, which "inter alia" have been validated as relevant to professional and academic expertise, form an integrated knowledge base about evidence which can be visualised on a concept map. The network of ideas underpinning research expertise across scientific disciplines is outlined. Research from explicitly teaching the concepts of evidence is reported, and the implications for teaching and learning in science-based disciplines in HE are considered.

AB  - This pilot study investigates the impact of a 2-week professional development Summer Institute on PK-3 teachers' knowledge and practices. This Summer Institute is a component of [program], a large-scale early-childhood science project that aims to transform PK-3 science teaching. The mixed-methods study examined concept maps, lesson plans, and classroom observations to measure possible changes in PK-3 teachers' science content knowledge and classroom practice from 11 teachers who attended the 2014 Summer Institute. Analysis of the concept maps demonstrated statistically significant growth in teachers' science content knowledge. Analysis of teachers' lesson plans demonstrated that the teachers could design high quality science inquiry lessons aligned to the "Next Generation Science Standards" following the professional development. Finally, examination of teachers' pre- and post-Summer Institute videotaped inquiry lessons showed evidence that teachers were incorporating new inquiry practices into their teaching, especially regarding classroom discourse. Our results suggest that an immersive inquiry experience is effective at beginning a shift towards reform-aligned science and engineering instruction but that early elementary educators require additional support for full mastery.

AB  - This column provides ideas and techniques to enhance your science teaching. This month's issue discusses planning and using interactive word walls to support science and reading instruction. Many classrooms have word walls displaying vocabulary that students have learned in class. Word walls serve as visual scaffolds to support instruction. To support vocabulary development in science, we replaced traditional word walls, which are generally lists of words or word banks, with interactive word walls. Interactive word walls may resemble graphic organizers or data tables. They highlight connections between concepts and artifacts (realia) from inquiry-based science activities while connecting scientific concepts and academic vocabulary. They strategically target vocabulary and include visual aids that illustrate word meanings to deepen understanding. Interactive word walls usually include a visual representation of specific vocabulary words and labels. Definitions are optional. In this article, the authors describe how they select vocabulary for interactive word walls and their efforts to use interactive word walls as scaffolds that help students effectively communicate scientific ideas and structure writing.

AB  - Academic tracking, placing students in different classes based on past performance, is a common feature of the American secondary school system. A longitudinal study of secondary students' chemistry self-concept scores was conducted, and one feature of the study was the presence of academic tracking. Though academic tracking is one way to group data for analysis, since students are naturally grouped in their classes, we aimed to uncover other groupings characterized by their self-concept scores. A cluster analysis was performed using scores from the chemistry and mathematics subscales of the chemistry self-concept inventory. The analysis yielded five clusters, four of which demonstrate a positive relationship between chemistry and mathematics self-concept scores. One cluster, however, was composed of students with low chemistry self-concept scores and high mathematics self-concept scores. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), new to chemistry education research (CER), were used to identify smaller groupings of students within the clusters to better understand students' self-concept. This technique was also used to explore longitudinal trends in students' chemistry self-concept data. This work has important implications for tracking in chemistry, the value of considering the affective characteristics of chemistry students, and the prospect of SOMs as a new CER tool.

AB  - Organic chemistry students struggle with multiple aspects of reaction mechanisms and the curved arrow notation used by organic chemists. Many faculty believe that an understanding of nucleophiles and electrophiles, among other concepts, is required before students can develop fluency with the electronpushing formalism (EPF). An expert concept map was created to depict an understanding of nucleophiles and electrophiles ideally held by undergraduates. Second year organic chemistry students were interviewed and asked to give examples of nucleophiles and electrophiles and to identify them in reactions. A cognitive map was created to represent each student's understanding. The students' maps were compared to the expert map, revealing that students possess fragmented ideas about the structure and function of nucleophiles and electrophiles.

AB  - In this paper, we explore the use of concept maps (Cmaps) as instructional materials prepared by teachers, to foster the understanding of chemistry. We choose fireworks as a macroscopic event to teach basic chemical principles related to the Bohr atomic model and matter-energy interaction. During teachers' Cmap navigation, students can experience a sense of disorientation, which is detrimental to the learning process. Two graphical cues were tested as Cmap navigation guidance: (1) colour-coded concepts, to group similar content and (2) numbered propositions to offer a reading sequence. A quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test design combined with mental effort was utilized to measure the efficiency of Cmaps in learning. First-year undergraduate students (n = 85) were randomly assigned to study one of four possible Cmaps. The results showed that all students were able to increase their level of factual knowledge, despite the Cmap being used as an instructional material. The lack of cues impaired conceptual understanding. Signalling similar content using colours was critical to reduce the invested mental effort and foster understanding about chemical concepts.

AB  - This paper reports on teachers' views on concept mapping: its applicability; reliability; advantages and; difficulties. A close-ended questionnaire was administered to 50 purposefully selected secondary school mathematics teachers from Sekhukhune District, Limpopo, South Africa. The findings indicate that mathematics teachers generally perceive that concept map: is useful; effective; is a practical tool for teaching mathematical concepts; represents and organises knowledge; helps retention and recall of concepts learnt and; provides feedback on the understanding of the concepts learnt. An important implication of this study is that there is a need for teachers to incorporate the concept mapping in the formative assessment process.

AB  - Facilitating student growth and development in diagnosing and solving technical problems remains a challenge for technology and engineering educators. With funding from the National Science Foundation, this team of researchers developed a self-guided, computer-based instructional program to experiment with conceptual mapping as a treatment to improve undergraduate technology and engineering students' abilities to develop a plan of action when presented with real technical problems developed in collaboration with industrial partners. The pilot-testing and experimental portions of the project confirmed that the subjects found the training interesting and useful. However, the experimental data did not support the conclusion that the treatment caused an increase in diagnostic performance. Analysis of individual data demonstrated that for a portion of the sample, significant gains occurred. Qualitative analysis demonstrated that the majority of the students treated the experience as a trivial academic exercise, which seriously limited their efforts. A major step forward occurred in the ability to automatically compare student maps with the expert's reference map using a modified version of the similarity flooding algorithm. Student feedback was based on this automatic comparison. In all, the experience has encouraged the team to continue and expand the use of conceptual mapping as a tool for improving diagnostic and problem-solving skills.

AB  - This article is a forum response to a research article on self-reporting methods when studying discrete emotions in science education environments. Studying emotions in natural settings is a difficult task because of the complexity of deciphering verbal and non-verbal communication. In my response I present three main points that build on insights mainly from philosophy and anthropology. The three points are: first, the significance of connecting the visible and measurable with the invisible and intangible; second, what it means to think about the practices of knowing; and third, an argument to map out a geography of analysis that takes also into account who or what emotions are directed at. [This review essay addresses issues raised in Stephen Ritchie, Peter Hudson, Alberto Bellocchi, Senka Henderson, Donna King and Kenneth Tobin's paper entitled: "Evolution of self-reporting methods for identifying discrete emotions in science classroom" (EJ1111440).]

AB  - It generally is accepted that concept mapping has a noticeable impact on learning. But literatures show the use of concept mapping is not benefit all learners. The present study explored the effects of incorporating computer-based concept mapping in physics instruction. A total of 61 9th-grade students participated in this study. By using a quasi-experimental research approach, 31 students were assigned to a group that received computer-based concept mapping assisting instruction (CBCM), and 30 students were assigned to a constructive activities group that received "Work, Power, and Energy Curriculum" instruction without concept mapping assistance (NCM). Both groups participated for eight weeks, with four sessions per week and 45 minutes per session. A pre test-post test control group design was employed. The findings revealed that the CBCM group students scored higher than the NCM group students on the cognition understanding and higher order thinking subtests. No significant differences were found in the conception memorization subtest. In the retention test, the students in the CBCM group outperformed the students in the NCM group on all subtests. The results of the current study revealed that concept mapping activities effectively promote higher order thinking and knowledge retention.

AB  - Advances in automated scoring technologies have the potential to support student learning during inquiry instruction by providing timely and adaptive guidance on individual students' responses. To identify which forms of automated guidance can be beneficial for inquiry learning, we compared reflective guidance to directive guidance for student-generated concept diagrams in web-based inquiry instruction. Eleven intact classes were randomly assigned to either a reflective guidance or a directive guidance condition. After creating a concept diagram showing energy flow in life science during the inquiry instruction, the directive group was told specific ways to improve their diagram, while the reflective group was told to revisit a relevant visualization step to locate useful information. The results from the concept diagrams, as well as individual tests, show that both forms of automated guidance helped students add target energy concepts, but reflective guidance was significantly more effective than directive guidance in improving students' coherent understanding of how energy flows in life science. Analyses of log data revealed that the reflective group was more likely to revisit the visualization step as suggested in the guidance, which significantly enhanced student learning. Detailed analyses suggest that revisiting relevant materials to find useful information challenged students to identify gaps in their understanding and distinguish among multiple ideas. This study shows the value of designing reflective automated guidance for helping students engage in evidence-gathering practices and enhance their understanding of scientific concepts. The findings suggest promising directions for the design of automated adaptive guidance to support complex science learning.

AB  - To determine the content of integrated curricula, clinical concepts and the underlying basic science concepts need to be made explicit. Preconstructed concept maps are recommended for this purpose. They are mainly constructed by experts. However, concept maps constructed by residents are hypothesized to be less complex, to reveal more tacit basic science concepts and these basic science concepts are expected to be used for the organization of the maps. These hypotheses are derived from studies about knowledge development of individuals. However, integrated curricula require a high degree of cooperation between clinicians and basic scientists. This study examined whether there are consistent variations regarding the articulation of integration when groups of experienced clinicians and basic scientists and groups of residents and basic scientists-in-training construct concept maps. Seven groups of three clinicians and basic scientists on experienced level and seven such groups on resident level constructed concept maps illuminating clinical problems. They were guided by instructions that focused them on articulation of integration. The concept maps were analysed by features that described integration. Descriptive statistics showed consistent variations between the two expertise levels. The concept maps of the resident groups exceeded those of the experienced groups in articulated integration. First, they used significantly more links between clinical and basic science concepts. Second, these links connected basic science concepts with a greater variety of clinical concepts than the experienced groups. Third, although residents did not use significantly more basic science concepts, they used them significantly more frequent to organize the clinical concepts. The conclusion was drawn that not all hypotheses could be confirmed and that the resident concept maps were more elaborate than expected. This article discusses the implications for the role that residents and basic scientists-in-training might play in the construction of preconstructed concept maps and the development of integrated curricula.

AB  - Computer hardware and mobile devices have developed rapidly in recent years, and augmented reality (AR) technology has been increasingly applied in mobile learning. Although instructional AR applications have yielded satisfactory results and prompted students' curiosity and interest, a number of problems remain. The crucial topic for AR applications is the lack of appropriate instructional scaffolds to help students organize the content to be learned. Moreover, a lack of appropriate instructional activities and scaffolds often results in student confusion and frustration. Therefore, we integrated AR with concept maps to form a concept-mapped AR (CMAR) scaffold. Subsequently, whether CMAR improves learning outcomes, motivation, and attitude in mobile learning activities was determined. An empirical study was conducted on 71 fifth-grade elementary students in Southern Taiwan. The students were divided into CMAR and AR system groups. The results showed that students in the CMAR group performed significantly better than those in the AR group. The student interview results also showed that the CMAR system helped students organize what they wanted to learn.

AB  - Among policy makers, there is an ongoing discussion about the need to improve undergraduate education in science and engineering. With many undergraduate students being taught by graduate teaching assistants (GTAs), it is important to explore the development of STEM knowledge for teaching by GTAs. This study follows ten GTAs as they participated in a GTA teaching program that included attending a "Scientific Teaching" course. Data collection consisted of open-ended questionnaires and concept maps. Analysis revealed that a majority of the GTAs employed more didactic, teacher-centered practices while having varied levels of development in the areas of student understanding and instructional strategies. Those GTAs with regularly scheduled opportunities to work directly with students increased their knowledge for teaching. Additionally, GTAs with lower levels of prior teaching experience and an expressed desire to improve their teaching had the highest levels of knowledge development. From this study, we suggest that GTA programs support GTAs by initiating the preparation for teaching early in the TA experience. Finally, we recommend that science departments place more emphasis on teaching by providing GTAs with additional science education coursework as well as structured opportunities to work directly with students and to practice making use of reformed teaching strategies.

AB  - This study aims to analyse prospective chemistry teachers' cognitive structure related to the subject of covalent and ionic bonding. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the participants in order to determine their cognitive structure, and the interviews were audio recorded to prevent the loss of data. The data were transcribed and transferred into the computer medium. Furthermore, a flow map was prepared for each prospective chemistry teacher and then was analysed firstly in terms of quantitative variables used in presenting cognitive structure in quantitative statements. Secondly, the statements in the flow maps were analysed in terms of comprehension level. In consequence, it was found through flow maps that prospective chemistry teachers were not very different from each other in terms of cognitive structure and that their cognitive structures were full of inadequacies and misconceptions. Having analysed the statements in the flow maps in terms of the levels of comprehension, the scope and richness of prospective chemistry teachers' cognitive structures were exhibited in more details.

AB  - This two-group quasi-experimental study investigated the effects of the Online Advance Organizer Concept Teaching Material (ONACOM) integrated with inquiry teaching and expository teaching methods. Grade 7 students' posttest performances on the light unit achievement and light unit attitude tests controlled for gender, previous semester science grade, and pretest scores were analyzed. No significant treatment effects were found between the inquiry and expository approaches. However, both groups demonstrated significant pretest-posttest gains in achievement and attitude. Independent from the method used, ONACOM was judged effective in both groups as students demonstrated increased achievement and attitude scores. ONACOM has a social and semantic network-aided infrastructure that can be adapted to both methods to increase students' achievement and improve their attitude.

AB  - The aim of this study is to reveal pre-service science teachers' cognitive structures regarding Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) and science education. The study group of the study consisted of 192 pre-service science teachers. A Free Word Association Test (WAT) consisting of science, technology, engineering, mathematics and science education concepts and semi-structured interview records were utilised to reveal their opinions regarding these concepts and inter-conceptual relations were used as data collection tools. While the WAT was implemented with all of the pre-service teachers, semi-structured interviews were carried out with only eight of the pre-service science teachers. Using two data collection tools via triangulation, enabled the researchers to obtain similar and varied findings. According to the frequencies, WAT was analysed using the cut-off point (CP) method; hence, concept network maps were composed and interviews were descriptively analysed. The findings of the study revealed that pre-service teachers' cognitive structures involved STEM disciplines and science education were quite independent from each other. Also, they could not make a distinction between science concept and science education concept, nor associate "technology, engineering and mathematics' concepts" with "science and science education" concepts.

AB  - Determining what students think about science, technology, and society (STS) is of great importance. This also provides the basis for scientific literacy. As such, this study was conducted with a total of 102 senior students attending a university located in western Turkey. This study utilized the survey model as a research model and the qualitative data collection method for gathering data. A questionnaire consisting of five open-ended questions was submitted to students who participated in the study. Separate categories were structured for the responses to each question. These categories were analyzed to present student-opinion profiles, and the percentages of student responses were then calculated. According to the results of this study, most students defined both the concepts of science and technology with concrete meanings. In addition, student opinions related to the significance of science and technology for society were collected under seven main categories and presented using a mind map. Separately, students were mostly of the opinion that science comes before technology. Finally, most of the students were found to see the future of science and technology as good.

AB  - In this study, the effect of group work and traditional method on 9th grade students' misconceptions about Newton Laws was investigated. The study was conducted in three classes in an Anatolian Vocational High School in Ankara/Turkey in the second term of the 2014-2015 academic year. Two of these classes were chosen as the experimental group and one as the control group. The groups in the experimental group were formed on a voluntary basis with two students in each of them. These experimental groups were given activities which included methods such as concept maps, worksheets, concept cartoons, doing experiments, preparing a project homework and doing case studies. In the control group, the activities which were done in the experimental groups were converted into questions and solved by the students and the teacher. As the assessment tool, "Force Motion Misconception Test" was used, whose validity and reliability studies had been performed by carrying out pilot studies. This test was administered to both the experimental groups and the control group as pre-test before the teaching and post-test after the teaching. The data obtained showed that there was no significant difference in post-tests between the experimental and control group students in terms of misconceptions (p>0.005). However, according to the averages, the students in the experimental groups were observed to have fewer misconceptions than those in the control group.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an experimental project in which media students created a short video. The students in groups of 4 or 5 used concept maps for collected their ideas about organizing the project. The analysis of the concept maps revealed that two groups were product-oriented, one group was workflow-oriented, and two groups used concepts that belonged to both categories. The contents of the concept maps also reflected students' prior knowledge and skills related to the task. In a joint discussion of the concept maps, students created a to-do list for shooting the video, which was an important activity to build common knowledge. This project confirms that the use of concept maps is a useful tool for developing students' professional skills.

AB  - We review literature on the teaching and learning of chemical kinetics at both the secondary and tertiary levels. Our aim in doing so is to summarize research literature, synthesize recommendations for future research, and suggest implications for practitioners. Two main bodies of literature emerged from the chemical kinetics education research: student understanding and instructional approaches to teaching. The student understanding findings are discussed in light of the anchoring concepts content map for general chemistry. We also review relevant literature about research on undergraduate mathematics education, as mathematics is often used as the primary language of communicating chemical kinetics. Finally, we discuss directions for future research and implications for practice.

AB  - The green chemistry course taught at Westminster College (PA) incorporates nontraditional teaching techniques and texts to educate future chemists about the importance of using green chemistry principles. The course is designed to introduce green chemistry concepts and demonstrate their inherent necessity by discussing historical missteps by the chemical industry, and future design possibilities. Students learn to apply green chemistry principles through case studies and journal article activities, while connecting all of these resources and experiences with concept maps. The final course project requires students to create their own green chemistry educational materials. This nontraditional approach to teaching chemistry provides an opportunity for students to learn in dynamic ways and to be creative in their contributions to green chemistry.

AB  - The increased interest in program- and university-level assessment over the past few decades has led to increased faculty involvement in developing program learning outcomes and performing program assessment activities. Depending on the level of support and encouragement faculty receive from administration and other entities, they may support or resist these activities. Faculty resistance may stem from fear of losing control of their course content, discouragement over previous failed assessment attempts, or confusion from inconsistent leadership. The School of Food Science, a joint program between the Washington State University and the University of Idaho, recently completed a curriculum mapping and assessment exercise that was conducted entirely by faculty. Faculty members teaching undergraduate courses were surveyed about their opinions of the mapping and assessment process both before and after the process was conducted. The goal of the surveys was to evaluate faculty opinion of these processes and how that opinion changed after completing the processes. Faculty members were generally supportive of the mapping and assessment processes, and willing to participate, and this opinion did not change after the processes were complete. The results of the mapping and assessment activities surprised most of the faculty, and they stated that they had ideas to address the issues found during the exercises. Overall, these results are encouraging in terms of faculty support of the mapping and assessment processes. Provided that administrative support of these processes continues and there is consistent leadership, faculty should continue to be supportive of program level assessment.

AB  - The main objective of this paper is to show a set of new methodologies applied in the teaching of Computer Science using ICT. The methodologies are framed in the conceptual basis of the following sciences: Psychology, Education and Computer Science. The theoretical framework of the research is supported by Behavioral Theory, Gestalt Theory. Genetic-Cognitive Psychology Theory and Dialectics Psychology. Based on the theoretical framework the following methodologies were developed: Game Theory, Constructivist Approach, Personalized Teaching, Problem Solving, Cooperative Collaborative learning, Learning projects using ICT. These methodologies were applied to the teaching learning process during the Algorithms and Complexity--A&C course, which belongs to the area of Computer Science. The course develops the concepts of Computers, Complexity and Intractability, Recurrence Equations, Divide and Conquer, Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Shortest Path Problem and Graph Theory. The main value of the research is the theoretical support of the methodologies and their application supported by ICT using learning objects. The course aforementioned was built on the Blackboard platform evaluating the operation of methodologies. The results of the evaluation are presented for each of them, showing the learning outcomes achieved by students, which verifies that methodologies are functional.

AB  - Research has suggested that teaching and learning in molecular and cellular biology (MCB) is difficult. We used a new lens to understand undergraduate reasoning about molecular mechanisms: the knowledge-integration approach to conceptual change. Knowledge integration is the dynamic process by which learners acquire new ideas, develop connections between ideas, and reorganize and restructure prior knowledge. Semistructured, clinical think-aloud interviews were conducted with introductory and upper-division MCB students. Interviews included a written conceptual assessment, a concept-mapping activity, and an opportunity to explain the biomechanisms of DNA replication, transcription, and translation. Student reasoning patterns were explored through mixed-method analyses. Results suggested that students must sort mechanistic entities into appropriate mental categories that reflect the nature of MCB mechanisms and that conflation between these categories is common. We also showed how connections between molecular mechanisms and their biological roles are part of building an integrated knowledge network as students develop expertise. We observed differences in the nature of connections between ideas related to different forms of reasoning. Finally, we provide a tentative model for MCB knowledge integration and suggest its implications for undergraduate learning.

AB  - Gesture-based learning have particularities, because learners interact in the learning process through the actual way, just like they interact in the nondigital world. It also can support kinesthetic pedagogical practices to benefit learners with strong bodily-kinesthetic intelligence. But without proper assistance or guidance, learners' learning performance are usually disappointing. To cope with this problem, the aim of this paper proposed a concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching system in earth science course. There were 90 participants in the experiments designed with the three teaching strategies (concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching system, conventional gesture-based teaching system, and traditional e-book teaching materials). The experimental results show that the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy and traditional e-book teaching materials also improve the learning performance of the students in earth science course than conventional gesture-based teaching strategy. Learners' cognitive load was also measured and showed that the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy had lower cognitive load than conventional gesture-based teaching strategy. There was no significant difference in learning performance and cognitive load between the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy and traditional e-book teaching materials.

AB  - This article notes the convergence of recent thinking in neuroscience and grounded cognition regarding the way we understand mental representation and recollection: ideas are dynamic and multi-modal, actively created at the point of recall. Also, neurophysiologically, re-entrant signalling among cortical circuits allows non-conscious processing to support our deliberative thoughts and actions. The qualitative research we describe examines the exchanges occurring during semi-structured interviews with 360 children age 3-13, including 294 from New Zealand (158 boys, 136 girls) and 66 from China (34 boys, 32 girls) concerning their understanding of the shape and motion of the Earth, Sun and Moon (ESM). We look closely at the relationships between what is revealed as children manipulate their own play-dough models and their apparent understandings of ESM concepts. In particular, we focus on the switching taking place between what is said, what is drawn and what is modelled. The evidence is supportive of Edelman's view that memory is non-representational and that concepts are the outcome of perceptual mappings, a view which is also in accord with Barsalou's notion that concepts are simulators or skills which operate consistently across several modalities. Quantitative data indicate that the dynamic structure of memory/concept creation is similar in both genders and common to the cultures/ethnicities compared (New Zealand European and Maori; Chinese Han) and that repeated interviews in this longitudinal research lead to more advanced modelling skills and/or more advanced shape and motion concepts, the results supporting hypotheses (Kolmogorov-Smirnov alpha levels 0.05; r[subscript s] : p < 0.001).

AB  - The amount of substance and its unit the mole is a basic concept in chemistry. However, previous research has shown that teaching and learning the concept are challenging tasks for both teachers and students. The purpose of this study was to pinpoint the problems which emerge in the teaching and learning process, and provide integrated suggestions for classroom instruction. By means of videotaping and interviews, the case studies explored how the mole is presented and conceptualized in two secondary classrooms in two different countries, Australia and Taiwan. Data analysis was based on a concept map and focused on how two key ideas were presented in the lessons and perceived by the students: (1) the definition of the mole, and (2) the concept of molar mass. The findings show that during the lessons on the mole, most of the time was spent on solving stoichiometric problems. Conceptually, the number aspect of the mole, that is, Avogadro's number, was emphasized; the concept of molar mass was introduced without meaningfully connecting it to the concept of relative atomic/molecular mass. Although the students were able to solve relevant problems, they could not coherently explain the relations among the concepts. Two critical components for a conceptual understanding of the mole emerged: (1) the number aspect of the mole needs to be justified by its mass aspect, and (2) the connection between molar mass and relative atomic/molecular mass needs to be explicitly explained. The two components provide one explanation for students' algorithmic learning and their confusion in learning about the mole, and serve as concrete suggestions for improving classroom instruction. The study once again manifested the significance of teaching for conceptual understanding in science education. It also exemplifies how a concept map of a specific scientific concept can also be a useful analytical tool in educational research.

AB  - This study sought to determine the levels of conceptual understanding of undergraduate students regarding organic compounds within different functional groups. A total of 60 students who were enrolled in the Department of Secondary Science and Mathematics Education of a Faculty of Education at a state university in Turkey and who had followed an Organic Chemistry Laboratory Course participated in the study. The data were collected using two tools: functional group worksheets and concept maps. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations were used in analyzing the data. The findings showed that the students generally had low levels of understanding of concepts relating to functional groups, and they exhibited a considerable number of misconceptions. Considering the findings more fully, it was determined that students have remarkable misconceptions and low levels of understanding about certain topics regarding functional groups, including the physical properties of functional groups, intermolecular bonds, acidity and basicity, reduction and oxidation, stereoisomerism and structural isomerism, and aromaticity and aliphaticity, as well as other organic chemistry concepts (e.g. decarboxylation, oxyacide, and phenol). The results suggest that since students are unable to adequately comprehend the subjects of general chemistry, such as intramolecular and intermolecular bonds, acidity and basicity, oxidation and reduction and determination of molecular structures, they fail to accurately transfer their knowledge to learning about organic chemistry. In order to promote students' understanding of functional groups and prevent related misconceptions, it is recommended that basic chemistry topics should be reinforced, and the relationship between students' current knowledge and the new information to be learned in organic chemistry should be emphasized with the help of activities in which various forms of thinking are used.

AB  - In searching for effective ways to combine science/chemical education with EE/ESD, new didactic materials were designed and produced focussing on biogeochemical cycles and their connection to sustainable development. The materials were experimentally applied in 16 Greek schools under the newly introduced compulsory "school project" which offers an excellent opportunity for the development of EE/ESD projects. The effectiveness of the intervention was assessed on the basis of questionnaires including knowledge and attitude questions and considering several factors (students' performance/grades, sex, previous participation in EE/ESD programmes, parents' educational level, etc.). The results demonstrated a positive impact on students' knowledge not only on biogeochemical cycles, but also on aspects related to sustainable development. Similarly, several components of students' attitudes vis a vis the environment and sustainable development (e.g. "Action commitment", "Efficacy perception of personal action" and "Sustainable orientation of the positive attitude towards the environment") were influenced positively.

AB  - We utilized cross tabulation statistics, word frequency counts, and content analysis of research output to conduct a bibliometric study, and used CiteSpace software to depict a knowledge map for research on entrepreneurship education in China from 2004 to 2013. The study shows that, in this duration, the study of Chinese entrepreneurship education experienced a progression through three stages, an "exploratory stage of learning from foreign models," a "developmental stage geared toward employment problems," and a "transformative stage promoting cultivation of student abilities," and featured three primary characteristics, "multidisciplinary fusion," "imbalanced regional distribution," and "policy orientation." In the future, popular fields in the study of entrepreneurship education are to be concentrated in the three areas, namely "entrepreneurship education and talent cultivation," "entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial environments," and "entrepreneurship education and innovation education."

AB  - Concept maps have a long history in educational settings as a tool for teaching, learning, and assessing. As an assessment tool, they are predominantly used to extract the structural configuration of learners' knowledge. This article presents an investigation of the knowledge structures of a large group of beginning CS students. The investigation is based on a method that collects, aggregates, and automatically analyzes the concept maps of a group of learners as a whole, to identify common structural configurations and differences in the learners' knowledge. It shows that those students who have attended CS education in their secondary school life have, on average, configured their knowledge about typical core CS/OOP concepts differently. Also, artifacts of their particular CS curriculum are visible in their externalized knowledge. The data structures and analysis methods necessary for working with concept landscapes have been implemented as a GNU R package that is freely available.

AB  - Reduction is one of the key techniques used for problem-solving in computer science. In particular, in the theory of computation and complexity (TCC), mapping and polynomial reductions are used for analysis of decidability and computational complexity of problems, including the core concept of NP-completeness. Reduction is a highly abstract technique that involves revealing close non-trivial connections between problems that often seem to have nothing in common. As a result, proper understanding and application of reduction is a serious challenge for students and a source of numerous misconceptions. The main contribution of this paper is detection of such misconceptions, analysis of their roots, and proposing a way to address them in an undergraduate TCC course. Our observations suggest that the main source of the misconceptions is the false intuitive rule "the bigger is a set/problem, the harder it is to solve." Accordingly, we developed a series of exercises for proactive prevention of these misconceptions.

AB  - Concept mapping has been widely used in various fields to facilitate students' organization of knowledge. Previous studies have, however, pointed out that it is difficult for students to construct concept maps from the abundant searched data without appropriate scaffolding. Thus, researchers have suggested that students could produce high quality concept maps when they construct them with appropriate guidance. Accordingly, this study proposes a question prompt-based concept mapping approach, which was conducted in a computer course with a duration of 14 weeks on the research issue of global warming. There were 176 senior high school students from four classes who participated in the experiment. The study adopted a quasi-experimental design for the investigation of the effectiveness of the proposed approach; two classes were randomly assigned to be the experimental group, learning with the question prompt-based concept mapping approach, while the other two groups were the control group, who used the conventional concept mapping approach. The results indicated that the students in the experimental group had better performance than those in the control group in terms of their learning achievement, 5C competences, and learning attitudes. In addition, the results also showed that students with a reflective style had better learning achievement than those with an active style. Thus, it is worth investigating, for such an issue, how to propose more effective learning models for diverse student learning styles in the future. This can provide useful guidance for educators, practitioners and researchers in the areas of science education and computer-assisted education.

AB  - Concept mapping is a method of graphical learning that can be beneficial as a study method for concept linking and organization. Concept maps, which provide an elegant, easily understood representation of an expert's domain knowledge, are tools for organizing and representing knowledge. These tools have been used in educational environments to better connect the relationships among theory and practice as well as among other concepts covered in a course. They also help the learners build relationships between previous knowledge and newly introduced concepts, encouraging meaningful learning rather than rote learning. The overall interactions among hardware, computer basics, computer functions and etc., used to be simple and transparent enough for understanding computer systems. Nevertheless the modern computer technologies have become increasingly more complex which makes it very difficult to understand the whole system of the computers. This study is an analysis of the contribution made by concept maps to a Computer Architecture and Organization course (CAO). For a period of one semester, students were asked to prepare concept maps that they were later allowed to use when revising for their final exam. The students' success in the exam was then evaluated and their attitudes towards the course, the concept maps and the questions on them were surveyed and analyzed. The results lead to the conclusion that not only did concept maps make a positive contribution to the students' overall success during the course, they also helped with their exam preparation.

AB  - This article presents the findings from an experimental study on the effectiveness of concept mapping and cooperative learning strategies on SSII students' achievement in trigonometry in mathematics. The research design used in conducting the study was quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test non-equivalent control group. The sample consisted of 210 (110 males & 100 females) SSII students from three senior secondary schools in Kano metropolis, Kano state, Nigeria. The main objectives of the study were to find out whether a significant mean difference exists in students' achievement in trigonometry when taught with concept mapping and cooperative learning strategies, and find out the effects of the two strategies on achievement based on gender. Data was collected using researchers developed achievement test in trigonometry tagged PRE-TAT & POST-TAT with a reliability coefficient of 0.75. Data analysis was done using descriptive statistics and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). The findings from the study among other things showed that the students taught using concept mapping performed better than those taught using cooperative learning strategy and both the two strategies were significantly better than the use of conventional teaching methods. The male students taught with concept mapping performed significantly better than female students. Also, the findings revealed the existence of gender differences in achievement of the students taught using cooperative learning strategy as against the use of conventional methods where it was discovered that female students performed significantly better than male students. It was recommended among other things that curriculum planners should incorporate concept mapping and cooperative learning strategies in mathematics curriculum guidelines towards the enhancement of achievement of senior secondary school students in mathematics.

AB  - Structured argumentation support environments have been built and used in scientific discourse in the literature. However, to the best our knowledge, there is no research work in the literature examining whether student's knowledge has grown during learning activities with asynchronous argumentation. In this work, an intelligent computer-supported collaborative argumentation-based learning platform that detects whether the learners address the expected discussion issues is proposed. After each learner presents an argument, a term weighting method is adopted to derive input parameters of a one-class support vector machines classifier which determines if the learners' arguments are related to the discussion topics. Notably, a peer review mechanism is established to improve the quality of the classifier. Besides, a feedback module is used to issue feedback messages to the learners if the learners have gone off on a tangent. The experimental results revealed that the students were benefited by the proposed learning-assistance platform.

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of using Google Docs in collaborative concept mapping (CCM) by comparing it with a paper-and-pencil approach. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in a physics course. The control group drew concept maps using the paper-and-pencil method and face-to-face discussion, whereas the experimental group employed Google Docs to create concept maps and used Google Chat for discussion. Learning achievements, physics concept representation, attitudes toward science, and attitudes toward CCM were examined to identify the differences between the two groups and the effectiveness of Google Docs. The results suggested that the use of Google Docs did not significantly affect physics achievement. However, Google Docs fostered physics concept representation and enhanced attitudes toward science. Moreover, the Google Docs group tended to learn more collaboratively. The students in this group also agreed with the superiority of observation and modification functions provided by the real-time co-editing mechanism and revision history.

AB  - Having students inspect and use each other's work is a promising way to advance inquiry-based science learning. Research has nevertheless shown that additional guidance is needed for students to take full advantage of the work produced by their peers. The present study investigated whether scaffolding through an integrated support tool could bring about the desired effect. This tool was embedded in an online inquiry learning environment and outlined the steps in searching for information in peer-created concept maps. It also contained specific directions to assess the quality of the retrieved information. The effectiveness of this search guidance tool was investigated during an inquiry-based science project. Main results indicated that high school students who were supported by the tool (n?=?19) developed a more differentiated and interconnected conceptual understanding than students who did not receive this scaffold (n?=?23). However, the search guidance tool also seemed to put additional demands on students' self-regulatory abilities, and might therefore require some practice or regulatory support to reach its full potential.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of concept mapping on mastery goal orientation and academic self-efficacy in a collaborative learning environment. The current study employed a randomized controlled pretest-posttest group design to examine if learning strategies such as concept mapping can help students with both reading comprehension achievement and intrinsic motivation of wanting to master a task at a high level. A total of 42 5th grade students at Ilshin Elementary School in South Korea participated in this study. The experiment group (n = 22) has undergone concept mapping training while the control group (n = 20) has not. All students were required to fill out questionnaires based on mastery goals, performance goals and academic self-efficacy. The results indicated that concept-mapping did not increase mastery goals and mastery goals had no effect on test scores. In addition, the interaction effect between academic self-efficacy and condition did not increase mastery goals and had no effect on test scores. In conclusion, the reduced number of samples may have caused a potential source of instability considering the statistical procedure chosen.

AB  - This article aims at studying pseudo construction of student thinking in mathematical concepts, integer number operation, algebraic forms, area concepts, and triangle concepts. 391 junior high school students from four districts of East Java Province Indonesia were taken as the subjects. Data were collected by means of distributing the main instrument and tracer instrument to the subjects respectively. Both instruments were deployed for the purpose of digging up the construction process. The construction was clustered on the basis of the pseudo construction cases and followed with in-depth interviews to three subjects of each case. The findings show that pseudo construction was identified in four cases. The first case was associated with integer operations, operations of algebraic form, the concept of area, and the concept of triangle. They used analogy of "in debt" to construct concepts of negative number operation. In the second case, they used objects (book, pencil, and thing) to describe variables in the algebraic form operation. For the third case, students deciphered unit area (m[superscript 2]) as multiplication m x m. In the fourth case, students did not pay attention to the requirements of the triangle. Although they gave a right answer to their work, their construction concept was completely false.

AB  - An action research study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of providing metacognitive support to enhance Year 9 students' metacognitive capabilities in order to better understand science concepts related to light, environmental health, ecosystems, genetics, ecology, atoms and the Periodic Table. The study was conducted over three years involving 35, 20 and 24 students in each year. The interventions included providing students with clearly stated focused outcomes about the relevant science concepts, engaging in collaborative group work, reading scientific texts and using concept mapping techniques. The data to evaluate the effectiveness of the metacognitive interventions were obtained from pre- and posttest results of the "Metacognitive Support Questionnaire" ("MSpQ"). The results showed gains in the "MSpQ."

AB  - Effective use of educational technologies by teachers in classrooms has come into prominence as the integration of technology into educational settings in todays world is considered as an inseparable part of an effective teaching. Besides, recent teacher training curriculums too emphasize the use of teaching strategies including technology to enhance student achievements. For this reason, it is decided to design a research focusing on to the use of an educational technologies based triadic teaching approach in teaching some environment-related subjects (global warming, ozone layer, air pollution, acid rains) of the science curriculum with 30 prospective science teachers through the special teaching methods course. The triadic teaching approach is comprised of internet-web based online research, poster preparation process activities and mini symposium activities steps. In order to establish the effect of the triadic teaching approach in selected environment-related subjects to meaningful learning of students, a pre and post word association test has applied, concept network maps of prospective teachers were drawn performed with them to collect their opinions on the triadic teaching approach. Findings of the study revealed that the triadic teaching approach has contributed to meaningful learning and ability of utilizing educational technologies of prospective teachers.

AB  - An important stage in any research inquiry is the development of research questions that need to be answered. The strategies to develop research questions should be defined and described, but few studies have considered this process in greater detail. This study explores pre-service science teachers' research questions and the strategies they can engage in during inquiry. A total of 59 pre-service science teachers who attended an undergraduate Fieldwork Course participated in the study. A single, holistic case study design was used along with an open-ended questionnaire and documents for data collection. The questionnaire was conducted at the end of the course, and documented inquiry reports were analyzed. The results indicate there are 11 methods for defining driving questions. These range from consulting an instructor to group discussion; 21 different strategies can be produced using these methods. These research question defining methods and strategies should be applied as a coding scheme for future studies and expanded. Any research question defining strategies unfamiliar to pre-service science teachers, such as field trips, brainstorming, and concept maps, should then be taught.

AB  - Aimed at developing methods, tools and techniques for delivery and evaluation of an educational module, this article addresses the needs of academicians restructuring, adjusting and altering their curricula to meet European Higher Education Area standards. The paper focuses on two pressing issues -- the applicability of and adjustment to European standards in the Russian higher education system. These issues are exemplified by the pilot implementation of a course in Language Assessment at Kazan (Volga region) Federal University (KFU). In the paper the local impact of the course at KFU is viewed at four levels: Reactions, Learning Changes, Behaviour and Results. Impact data collected at KFU include the following: end of session written feedback, pre- and post-course questionnaires, observation in the classroom, interviews, concept maps, teacher portfolios, written assignments, tests/examinations and participant journal entries. Viewed as the first step in conducting a full Student Needs Analysis, the research is intended to inform the design and delivery of Language Assessment courses for graduates majoring in English, Linguistics or Pedagogy elsewhere. The methods, techniques and tools developed by the authors may also be adapted for application to any University course during piloting, or following its introduction.

AB  - The relevance of the article in question is that the success of pupils' learning depends not only on the aptitude of pupils, but also on the teaching technique, including universal educational technique of various complexities. This problem is relevant on all levels of learning--from nursery schools up to higher education, including refresher courses and retraining of teachers. The purpose of this article is working out visual aids for a teacher, based on logical-semantical modeling and functioning as navigators in learners' actions, when fulfilling educational tasks. The leading method of this problem is the method of visual notion of logical- semantic models of educational actions, which enable us to view the initial problem as a purposeful and well-organized process of learning. According to the scheme of the learning process students fulfill few-stepped and multi-stepped actions and, as a result, the time of the teacher's oral explanation is shortened. The article gives logical foundation to the implementation of logical-semantic visual navigators for presenting universal educational actions. These actions are realized in coordinate matrix structures which help to fulfill few-stepped educational actions; at the same time the contents of navigators clearly reflect multi-stepped, I. e. scenario-based training actions. The functions of visual forms of navigators are clearly shown in the article. This enables students to be guided by them in the educational process, and the teacher can control the process of solving educational tasks according to the given training actions. It has been proved that the professional competence of teachers are improved thanks to the projecting of logical-semantic navigators which enable them to solve systematic tasks in forming universal training actions, performed by students.

AB  - A value-centered approach to science, technology and society (STS) education illuminates the need of reflexive and relational learning through communication and public engagement. Visualization is a key to represent and compare mental models such as assumptions, background theories and value systems that tacitly shape our own understanding, interests and interactions. Yet conventional approaches including concept mapping and multi-criteria value elicitation methods often have little suggestion or implication as to how participants themselves can address and deliberate the incompatibility of their perceptions, preferences and perspectives. This study proposes Q workshop as a legitimate eliciting and deliberation technique that can be employed in pluralistic discourse, exploring systematic divergences of perspective by constructing the participant's self in a formative, emergent and contingent manner. For this it introduces Q mapping as a novel visualization tool for the hybridity of qualitative and quantitative methods derived from Q methodology. Q mapping is a two-factor solution that transforms the similarities in participants' individual Q scores into distances represented in two-dimensional space, for the sake of illustrating the relative positioning and partitioning of perspectives in a schematic figure. A case study on STS education for postgraduate students demonstrates that Q workshop can play a heuristic and abductive role in providing independent illumination of distinguishable perspectives and facilitating individual and collective learning among participants, suggesting a schematic two-dimensional basis for resolving the key differences.

AB  - In many science education practices, students are expected to develop an understanding of scientific knowledge without being allowed a view of the practices and cultures that have developed and use this knowledge. Therefore, students should be allowed to develop scientific concepts in relation to the contexts in which those concepts are used. Since many concepts are used in a variety of contexts, students need to be able to recontextualise and transfer their understanding of a concept from one context to another. This study aims to develop a learning and teaching strategy for recontextualising cellular respiration. This article focuses on students' ability to recontextualise cellular respiration. The strategy allowed students to develop their understanding of cellular respiration by exploring its use and meaning in different contexts. A pre- and post-test design was used to test students' understanding of cellular respiration. The results indicate that while students did develop an acceptable understanding of cellular respiration, they still had difficulty with recontextualising the concept to other contexts. Possible explanations for this ack of understanding are students' familiarity with the biological object of focus in a context, the manner in which this object is used in a context and students' understanding of specific elements of cellular respiration during the lessons. Although students did develop an adequate understanding of the concept, they do need more opportunities to practice recontextualising the concept in different contexts. Further research should focus on improving the strategy presented here and developing strategies for other core concepts in science.

AB  - Empirical analysis of secondary biology classrooms revealed that, on average, 68% of teaching time in Germany revolved around processing tasks. Quality of instruction can thus be assessed by analyzing the quality of tasks used in classroom discourse. This quasi-experimental study analyzed how teachers used tasks in 38 videotaped biology lessons pertaining to the topic "blood and circulatory system". Two fundamental characteristics used to analyze tasks include: (1) required cognitive level of processing (e.g. low level information processing: repetiition, summary, define, classify and high level information processing: interpret-analyze data, formulate hypothesis, etc.) and (2) complexity of task content (e.g. if tasks require use of factual, linking or concept level content). Additionally, "students' cognitive knowledge structure" about the topic "blood and circulatory system" was measured using student-drawn concept maps (N = 970 students). Finally, linear multilevel models were created with "high-level cognitive processing tasks" and "higher content complexity tasks" as class-level predictors and "students' prior knowledge", "students' interest in biology", and "students' interest in biology activities" as control covariates. Results showed a positive influence of high-level cognitive processing tasks (ß = 0.07; p <0.01) on "students' cognitive knowledge structure". However, there was no observed effect of "higher content complexity tasks" on "students' cognitive knowledge structure." Presented findings encourage the use of "high-level cognitive processing tasks" in biology instruction.

AB  - Using multiple representations and argumentation are two fundamental processes in science. With the advancements of information communication technologies, these two processes are blended more so than ever before. However, little is known about how these two processes interact with each other in student learning. Hence, we conducted a design-based study in order to distill the relationship between these two processes. Specifically, we designed a learning unit on nuclear energy and implemented it with a group of preservice middle school teachers. The participants used a web-based knowledge organization platform that incorporated three representational modes: textual, concept map, and pictorial. The participants organized their knowledge on nuclear energy by searching, sorting, clustering information through the use of these representational modes and argued about the nuclear energy issue. We found that the use of multiple representations and argumentation interacted with each other in a complex way. Based on our findings, we argue that the complexity can be unfolded in two aspects: (a) the use of multiple representations mediates argumentation in different forms and for different purposes; (b) the type of argumentation that leads to refinement of the use of multiple representations is often non-mediated and drawn from personal experience.

AB  - This study examined the reflection interview as a tool for assessing and facilitating the use of "systems language" amongst 11th grade students who have recently completed their first year of high school biology. Eighty-three students composed two concept maps in the 10th grade--one at the beginning of the school year and one at its end. The first part of the interview is dedicated to guiding the students through comparing their two concept maps and by means of both explicit and non-explicit teaching. Our study showed that the explicit guidance in comparing the two concept maps was more effective than the non-explicit, eliciting a variety of different, more specific, types of interactions and patterns (e.g. "hierarchy", "dynamism", "homeostasis") in the students' descriptions of the human body system. The reflection interview as a knowledge integration activity was found to be an effective tool for assessing the subjects' conceptual models of 'system complexity', and for identifying those aspects of a system that are most commonly misunderstood.

AB  - Evolutionary trees are key tools for modern biology and are commonly portrayed in textbooks to promote learning about biological evolution. However, many people have difficulty in understanding what evolutionary trees are meant to portray. In fact, some ideas that current professional biologists depict with evolutionary trees are neither clearly defined nor conveyed to students. To help biology teachers and students learn how to more deeply interpret, understand and gain knowledge from diagrams that represent ancestor-descendant relationships and evolutionary lineages, we describe the different rooted and unrooted evolutionary tree visualisations and explain how they are best read. Examples from a study of tree-shaped diagrams in the journal "Science" are used to illustrate how to distinguish evolutionary trees from other tree-shaped representations that are easily misunderstood as visualising evolutionary relationships. We end by making recommendations for how our findings may be implemented in teaching practice in this important area of biology education.

AB  - This descriptive study examines online assessment strategies employed by preservice teacher candidates when creating thematic learning experiences in online teaching environments. Using the learning management system Moodle as part of their innovative training, this review of a sample of 395 candidate-created instructional units across all grades and most subject areas examines their use of a variety of assessment instruments to gather both formative and summative data. The large data set allowed the researcher to infer the teacher candidates' understanding of the value of different assessment types and their use in an assessment strategy for the unit. Learning management systems have many built-in affordances, including the ability for teachers to make quizzes, host discussion forums, use concept mapping, and facilitate collaborative projects using multimedia as well as text. In this study, the majority of students cautiously made use of more traditional tools such as quizzes and reports without taking full advantage of the power and potential of collaborative and creative potential in the development of authentic assessments. Analysis of these data showed that teacher candidates at the upper elementary level and in subjects like Science and Language Arts made far greater use of open-ended summative assessment activities than did other subgroupings.

AB  - This article describes the social networks of four young people with intellectual disabilities in supported adult education, focusing on their inclusion in school and leisure environments. A multiple case study approach with content analysis was used. Data were collected through interviews with young people and their family members, relationship maps, observation journals and notes from Personal Futures Planning meetings. Relationships with family members, other relatives and neighbours were close. One participant had a friend of her own age with no disabilities. The other three had varying, superficial peer relationships and friends of the family. All the participants had heterogeneous relationship maps and had no difficulties in nominating the people who were important to them. All of them hoped to make friends with peers without disabilities.

AB  - The WAEC Chief Examiner's report of 2013 pointed out that mass failure in geography had badly affected students who have the desire to study science related subjects in our Universities. The poor image of geography among students was attributed partly to its wide content and partly to the old fashioned approach to its teaching. This study therefore was on the effect of note-taking patterns on the academic achievement in geography on the students. A non-equivalent quasi-experimental research design was adopted by the researcher. Two hundred and five students in three intact classes from three secondary schools in Enugu South of Enugu State formed the sample. Two intact classes where randomly assigned experimental group one and taught with concept mapping notes; experimental group two and taught with outline notes. The third intact class was the control group and taught with the conventional notes. Two research questions and two hypotheses guided the study. Test of Geography Achievement and Retention (TOGAR) was used for data collection. Mean and standard deviation were used to answer the research questions while the hypotheses were test using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). The result of the study revealed that the students of the experimental groups achieved better than the control group with those taught using concept mapping being the best. Recommendations were made.

AB  - The study investigated the effects of concept mapping on students' achievement in basic science. The study was carried out in Ebonyi State of Nigeria. The study employed a quasi-experimental design. Specifically the pretest posttest non-equivalent control group research design was used. The sample was 122 students selected from two secondary schools drawn from the population through a simple random sampling. One school was used for treatment and the other for control. The treatment group was taught basic science with concept mapping approach while the other was taught with conventional method. Three research questions and three null hypotheses guided the study. Mean, standard deviation and the Analysis of Co-Variance (ANCOVA) were used to analyze data. Results showed that concept mapping fosters students' achievement in basic science than conventional method. It boosts the achievement of both male female students in the subject. In addition there is no interaction between gender and teaching methods on students' achievement in basic science.

AB  - A study plan is the choice of concepts and the organization and sequencing of the concepts to be covered in an educational course. While a good study plan is essential for the success of any course offering, the design of study plans currently remains largely a manual task. We present a novel data-driven method, which given a list of concepts can automatically propose candidate plans to cover all the concepts. Our method uses Wikipedia as an external source of knowledge to both identify which concepts should be studied together and how students should move from one group of concepts to another. For our experimental validation, we synthesize study plan for a course defined by a list of concept names from high school physics. Our user study with domain experts finds that our method is able to produce a study plan of high quality.

AB  - Concept map activities often lack a subsequent revision step that facilitates knowledge integration. This study compares two collaborative critique activities using a Knowledge Integration Map (KIM), a form of concept map. Four classes of high school biology students (n?=?81) using an online inquiry-based learning unit on evolution were assigned to one of two conditions. Student dyads in one condition compared their concept maps against an expert map while dyads in the other condition conducted a peer-review. Analysis of the concept maps suggests that students in both conditions improved their understanding of evolution from pretest to posttest. However, the two conditions lead to different criteria: Students in the expert-map condition focused mostly on concept-focused criteria like concept classification while students in the peer-review condition used more link-focused criteria like link labels and missing connections. This paper suggests that both forms of KIM critique activities can be beneficial for constructing more coherent connections across different topics in evolution education. These results support the value of collaborative KIM critique activities and help clarify the forms of collaborative activities that are most likely to be effective to facilitate knowledge integration processes.

AB  - Background: Enhancing students' metacognitive abilities will help to facilitate their understanding of science concepts. Purpose: The study was designed to conduct and evaluate the effectiveness of a repertoire of interventions aimed at enhancing secondary school students' metacognitive capabilities and their achievements in science. Sample: A class of 35 Year 9 students participated in the study. Design and methods: The study involved a pre-post design, conducted by the first author as part of the regular designated science programme in a class taught by him. In order to enhance the students' metacognitive capabilities, the first author employed clearly stated focused outcomes, engaging them in collaborative group work, reading scientific texts and using concept mapping techniques during classroom instruction. The data to evaluate the effectiveness of the metacognitive interventions were obtained from pre- and post-test results of two metacognitive questionnaires, the "Metacognitive Support Questionnaire" ("MSpQ") and the "Metacognitive Strategies Questionnaire" ("MStQ"), and data from interviews. In addition, pre-test and post-test scores were used from a two-tier multiple-choice test on Light. Results: The results showed gains in the "MSpQ" but not in the "MStQ." However, the qualitative data from interviews suggested high metacognitive capabilities amongst the high- and average-achieving students at the end of the study. Students gains were also evident from the test scores in the Light test. Conclusion: Although the quantitative data obtained from the "Metacognitive Strategies Questionnaire" did not show significant gains in the students' metacognitive strategies, the qualitative data from interviews suggested positive perceptions of students' metacognitive strategies amongst the high- and average-achieving students. Data from the "Metacognitive Support Questionnaire" showed that there were significant gains in the students' perceptions of their metacognitive support implying that the majority of the students perceived that their learning environment was oriented towards the development of their metacognitive capabilities. The effect of the metacognitive interventions on students' achievement in the Light test resulted in students displaying the correct declarative knowledge, but quite often they lacked the procedural knowledge by failing to explain their answers correctly.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to consider how the 21st-century learning framework reflects principles of creativity. This article provides a qualitative analysis of the Partnership for 21st Century's (P21) policy documents, with a specific focus on how the principles of creativity, one of the 4Cs (creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, and communication) of the P21 learning framework, are reflected in these documents. Applying concepts from the conceptual and empirical literature on creativity, this article reveals substantive differences between English and science-technology-engineering-mathematics (STEM; mathematics and science) maps. The article also explores the role of technology in teaching creativity while addressing the new set of standards. Our findings have implications for reformers and practitioners who strive to address issues of creativity and innovation in policy and instruction.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine relationships among pre-service science teachers' conceptual knowledge of electric current, motivational beliefs, and self-regulation. One hundred and twenty-seven students (female = 107, male = 20) enrolled in the science education program of a public university in Ankara participated the study. A concept map technique was used to determine students' conceptual knowledge level of electric current. To determine students' motivational beliefs and self-regulation, a scale developed by Velayutham, Aldridge, and Fraser (2011) was first translated into Turkish and adapted to Turkish culture and then used as a measurement tool. Results showed that students' motivational beliefs were positively associated with their self-regulation, and students' task value, self-efficacy, and self-regulation were positively related with students' conceptual knowledge of electric current. These results show that students' motivational beliefs and self-regulation have important roles in students' conceptual knowledge level when assessed using concept map technique.

AB  - In three experiments, students were trained to use strategies for learning from scientific texts: text highlighting (Experiment 1), knowledge mapping (Experiment 2), and visualizing (Experiment 3). Each experiment compared a control condition, cognitive strategy training, and a combined cognitive strategy plus metacognitive self-regulation training with a specific focus on the quality of cognitive strategy application. After the training, students applied the learning strategies as they studied scientific texts. Across experiments, the results indicated that the self-regulation component of the training helped the students to overcome the lack of efficacy of the cognitive strategy only training when it was not effective by itself: The highlighting-only group was outperformed by the control group (d?=?-1.25), but the combined highlighting-plus-self-regulation training reduced this negative effect (d?=?-0.21). The mapping-only group performed as well as the control group (d?=?-0.12), but the combined mapping-plus-self-regulation group outperformed the control group (d?=?0.76). The visualizing-only group outperformed the control group (d?=?0.72) as did the combined visualizing-plus-self-regulation group (d?=?0.78). Results suggest that cognitive learning strategies differ in their potential to induce deep versus surface processing of text contents. In addition, the metacognitive self-regulation component of the training enhanced students' performance when the cognitive strategy training was not effective by itself.

AB  - If a person has "a problem" to solve and knows the solution and just has to apply it (retrieve it from memory and re-act), it is not a problem--it is a task; if a person does not know the solution and has to create it--this is a problem. Using this language, there are only two situations: (a) one has to perform a task; or (b) one has to solve a problem by creating a new (for the person) procedure, i.e. one has to create a brand new (for the one) solution; of course, one must utilize some of the knowledge previously stored in the memory (we could call this action "creative utilization of previous knowledge"). If a student learned how to perform a task, he or she can repeat it in the future as many times as this student has to repeat the same task. The key word is "the same". Our brain is a powerful pattern recognition machine. As soon as it recognizes the task, it retrieves from memory the sequence of the actions, which has to be performed to succeed. If a brain does not recognize the task, we have two options: (a) the task is the same but due to some features it is camouflaged as a different one; (b) the task is different from the ones in the past and is really new for the brain, and the brain does not have the solution (at least in full) in its storage. Of course, we assume that a particular brain is capable of storing and retrieving the information and governing the actions required for fulfilling the task (otherwise we have to discuss a case of learning disabilities). Based on this approach, every teacher has to teach students to two different practices: (a) how to perform specific tasks (the set of those tasks should be specified by a curriculum); (b) how to create a solution to a problem which has not been solved in the past (by that person); the latter practice, in turn, requires a practice in making a conclusion regarding the familiarity of the given assignment--is it the same as one from the past (is it a task?) or different (is it a problem?)? Development of such a skill also requires specific practice. Teaching how to "find" a solution means (in part) teaching how to recognize the old task in the new one and to apply the appropriate method (which worked in the past). Teaching how to create/invent a solution which has not been presented/trained before (at least in full) means teaching thinking creatively (a.c.a. critically). Although due to the definition of "creativity" the act of creating something new should be seen as the result of an insight, a teacher can help a student to get to that insight as close as possible using specific teaching tools (learning aids). Many teaching instruments of the kind have been discussed and offered by various research. For example, E. F. Redish (2004) offers a general framework for Physics Education Research based on modeling student thinking. "Teaching Introductory Physics" by Arnold B. Arons (1997) is an invaluable source of many teaching tools and techniques. Many specific teaching strategies, including examples of mapping and guided thinking one will find in the works of K. Heller and P. Heller (1995). A Elby (2001) provides a broad summary on helping students learn how to learn (including asking prompting questions). D. Rosengrant "et al" (2009) offer a study of the use of diagrams, including free-body diagrams, as a helping tool for solving problems in mechanics. D. Van Domelen provides a review of the use of strategy maps and thinking algorithms. An excellent recourse letter is provided by L. C. McDermont and E. F. Redish (1999). The use of concept maps in education has been discussed in details by J. D. Novak (1984). In these works a reader will find a description of several tools which the author finds also helpful for students learning how to solve physics problems. These tools help students to get a better understanding of how a mind of an expert problem solver works when solving a problem.

AB  - Although concept maps have been used as alternative assessment methods in education, there has been an ongoing debate on how to evaluate students' concept maps. This study discusses how to evaluate students' concept maps as an assessment tool before and after 15 computer-based Predict-Observe-Explain (CB-POE) tasks related to acid-base chemistry. 12 high school students participated in this study. Students' concept maps were evaluated taking into account three parts: qualitative, quantitative and representational level. The results gathered from the quantitative analysis of the pre and post concept maps were analyzed using SPSS 17.0. The results showed that there is a significant difference between students' pre and post concept map scores (z = 3.05; p <0.05). From the qualitative analysis of the concept maps, the majority of the students constructed their pre and post concept maps non-hierarchically; while they drew more interconnected concept maps after the CB-POE tasks. Regarding their representational level, the students used the macroscopic level more often than microscopic and symbolic levels in both their pre and post concept maps. Nonetheless, they increased the number of macroscopic, microscopic and symbolic level representations in their post concept maps. The paper concludes with suggestions and implications for educators and researchers to improve the quality of concept map evaluation.

AB  - Identifying learning problems of students has been recognized as an important issue for assisting teachers in improving their instructional skills or learning design strategies. The accumulated assessment data provide an excellent resource for achieving this objective. However, most of conventional testing systems only record students' test results, which are not helpful to teachers in realizing students' learning problems without further assistance. To cope with this problem, in this study, an innovative approach that combines a student concept model and the change mining mechanism is proposed to analyze the learning problems of students from their historical assessment data. The teachers received the analysis results and then used those suggestions to improve their instructional strategies. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a web-based learning assessment system has been developed and an experiment has been conducted on an "Introduction to Computers" course in a university. The experimental results showed that, those analysis results provided by the innovative approach were helpful to the teachers in providing appropriate instructional assistance and remedial learning materials for improving the learning achievements of the students.

AB  - At Stellenbosch University, South Africa, basic histology is taught to a combination class of almost 400 first-year medical, physiotherapy, and dietetic students. Many students often find the amount of work in basic histology lectures overwhelming and consequently loose interest. The aim was to determine if a draw-along mapping activity would focus students during large class lectures. After each lecture on three basic histology tissues, a guided draw-along mapping session covering the work from the lecture was introduced in the form of a click-advance PowerPoint presentation which was used to demonstrate the unfolding of an "ideal" map. The lecturer simultaneously drew a similar map using an overhead projector allowing the students to draw their own maps on blank sheets of paper along with the lecturer. Students remained attentive during the activity and many participated in answering informal questions posed by the lecturer as the map-making session progressed. After the last session, students completed an anonymous, voluntary questionnaire (response rate of 78%). The majority of students found the draw-along maps useful (94%) and believed that its use should be continued in the future (93%). A significant increase (P < 0.001) was found in the test results of student cohorts who were given the current intervention compared to cohorts from previous years who were given mind maps as handouts only or had no intervention. The use of the draw-along mapping sessions were successful in focusing students during large class lectures while also providing them with a useful tool for their studies.

AB  - Many studies suggest that students have difficulties in learning acid-base concepts. This study presents some conflicts in the textbook descriptions of these concepts and proposes these to be the cause of the students' difficulties. This is especially true regarding the description of the relationship among the Arrhenius, Brønsted-Lowry, and Lewis concepts of acids and bases, which are represented schematically as a cumulatively developing figure. However, some reagents, such as NH[subscript 3], dry HCl, and H[subscript 2]SO[subscript 4], cannot be classified as acid or base according to these descriptions. A new relationship is suggested in this study based on the ontological category of scientific knowledge. Finally, it is suggested that all three concepts be taught for the purpose of understanding not only the concepts but also the developmental nature of scientific theories.

AB  - In secondary science education, the learning and teaching of coherent conceptual understanding are often problematic. Context-based education has been proposed as a partial solution to this problem. This study aims to gain insight into the development of conceptual coherence and how context-embedded learning-teaching activities (LT) can promote this. We describe a case study in which a context-based lesson sequence about protein-rich food production was designed and conducted in a 10th-grade biology class. The conceptual framework consisted of transformations of forms of energy and matter in photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and biosynthesis. All relevant concepts and their interconnections (propositions) were captured in a reference concept map. A research scenario was used to evaluate whether the lesson sequence was conducted as intended. Learning outcomes were determined by analyzing written products on the occurrence of propositions from the reference concept map. Additional interviews provided insight into the development of conceptual coherence in relation to three context-embedded LT activities: using graphic visualizations, writing, and concept mapping. The results indicated that students improved in mentioning propositions from the reference concept map. Propositions relating metabolic processes and including forms of energy were still difficult. Finally, successful elements of the three LT activities are considered.

AB  - The purpose of this study was primarily to explore high school students' cognitive structures and to identify their learning difficulties on ethanoic acid through the flow map method. The subjects of this study were 30 grade 1 students from Dong Yuan Road Senior High School in Xi'an, China. The interviews were conducted a week after the students had received instruction on ethanoic acid. The interview narratives were then transcribed into flow maps. Analysis of the flow maps showed that there existed a difference between the individual students' cognitive structure on ethanoic acid, higher academic achievers constructed more enriched cognitive structures and had higher scores for cognitive structural variables than lower academic achievers. Furthermore, the results of the correlation analysis of the students' cognitive structure outcomes, academic achievement and the information processing modes revealed that there was a positive correlation between two of them to some extent; in general, the higher academic achievers tended to have higher cognitive structure outcomes and employed high-order information processing modes. Analysis of the content of the flow maps of all the participants indicated that most of the students knew the main facts about ethanoic acid, but the details were not complete, and the misconceptions were mainly related to the molecular constitution and structure of ethanoic acid as well as to the esterification reaction, while the knowledge of the physical properties and the acidity of ethanoic acid seemed to have been mastered relatively well, as for the applications of ethanoic acid, students only mentioned that it can be used as condiment.

AB  - Concept mapping was developed as a method of displaying and organizing hierarchical knowledge structures. Using the new, multidimensional presentation software Prezi, we have developed a new teaching technique designed to engage higher-level skills in the cognitive domain. This tool, synthesis mapping, is a natural evolution of concept mapping, which utilizes embedding to layer information within concepts. Prezi's zooming user interface lets the author of the presentation use both depth as well as distance to show connections between data, ideas, and concepts. Students in the class Biology of Cancer created synthesis maps to illustrate their knowledge of tumorigenesis. Students used multiple organizational schemes to build their maps. We present an analysis of student work, placing special emphasis on organization within student maps and how the organization of knowledge structures in student maps can reveal strengths and weaknesses in student understanding or instruction. We also provide a discussion of best practices for instructors who would like to implement synthesis mapping in their classrooms.

AB  - This paper is an initial contribution to a general theory in which science classroom "activity types" and epistemological "discourse practices" are systematically linked. The idea is that activities and discourse are reflexively related, so that different types of science classroom activities (e.g., scientific argumentation, modeling, and design) recruit characteristically distinct forms of participants' (students and teacher) discourse. Such a general theory would eventually map out the full spectrum of discourse practices (and their patterns of manifestation) across various kinds of science classroom activities, and reveal new relationships between forms of both discourse and activities. Because this defines a complex and long-term project, here our aim is simply to delineate this larger theoretical program and to illustrate it with a detailed case study--namely, that of mapping out and characterizing the discourse practices of "design-based" science classroom activities. To do so, we draw on data from an activity that is prototypically design-based--i.e., one in which students iteratively design and refine an artifact (in this case, pictorial representations of moving objects)--and examine the structure and dynamics of the whole-class discourse practices that emerge around these representational forms. We then compare and contrast these discourse practices to those of an activity that is prototypical of "scientific argumentation" (taken from the literature)--i.e., one in which students argue between competing theories and explanations of a phenomenon--and begin to illustrate the kinds of insights our theoretical program might afford.

AB  - act In the study herein the authors adopted the framework of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) and the approach of technology mapping in order to teach secondary education computer science teachers how to teach with technology. During a 15-hour teacher professional development program, teachers learned how to think about the educational affordances of different computer tools, and how to use them to make computer science content more understandable to learners. In addition, teachers learned how to think iteratively about technology, content, and pedagogy in order to design learning activities appropriate for learners' conceptual ecology. The study presents good examples of TPCK in practice by demonstrating teachers' actual instructional artifacts as these emerged through their participation in the teacher professional development program, as well as their evaluations of the program.

AB  - Conceptual understanding is a major aim of mathematics education, and concept map has been used in non-mathematics research to uncover the relations among concepts held by students. This article presents the results of using concept map to assess conceptual understanding of basic algebraic concepts held by a group of 48 grade 8 Chinese students. The concept maps constructed by these students were scored by the number of links and propositions based on linking phrases, and these scores were analyzed to yield three types of results as follows: (a) relations associated with individual concepts, (b) relations between pairs of concepts, and (c) relations among all the given concepts at the whole class level to reveal the structure encompassing these concepts. It was found that the students tended to link from superordinate concepts to subordinate concepts. They seemed to hold different ideas about the relations among the concepts since there were more weak links than moderate and strong links in the collective map. A gap in the students' understanding of "equations" and "functions" was captured. The future use of concept map to study conceptual understanding of specific mathematics topics should deal with the issues of training and translation of findings into classroom practices.

AB  - School science textbooks are an amalgamation of concepts collected from different fields of Science like Physics, Chemistry and Biology. The actual number of concepts in the different domains of science are enormous. Educationists have to make a decision of choosing some concept that they think are necessary for students to know at a certain age. Moreover, these concepts have to be arranged in a certain order of arrangement from first chapter to the last in a textbook. The aim of this paper is to question the ontological basis of filtering concepts from the larger world of science to placing them in a school science textbook. Through two informal studies presented in this paper, the author has tried to demonstrate that different groups of people can form concept maps of a topic that are very different in structure compared to what is given in NCERT textbook. If there are multiple ways of arranging the same set of concepts, then how do educationist validate one set of arrangement of topics against the other? The result of study puts light on the fact that currently there are no criteria available for judging the ontological validity of concepts that are present in existing textbooks in school science curriculum. The selection of topics is dependent upon limited individual knowledge base of the expert who is writing the chapter. The article briefly provides a framework by which ontology of a subject can be developed collaboratively by a community of teachers and subject matter experts. This ontology can be used as a valid guide for choosing and arranging topics in a school level science textbook.

AB  - This work focuses on a possible teaching approach to promote chemistry learning for students during the first two years of technical high school in Italy (age 14-15). Critical thinking skills can be developed by integrating two different curriculum designs, converging in a novel didactic approach, a modified version of the Systemic Approach to Teaching and Learning (SATL). Interdisciplinary topics help to promote students' interest and motivation because of their applications in real situations, concerning in particular ethics and environmental issues. This method gives the right importance to a stimulating educational context where critical thinking skills are highly encouraged.

AB  - Librarians designed a biology tutorial not only to address an assignment, but also to make tutorials more accessible to students with various learning styles. The Science Librarian created the content by using aspects of the Information Literacy Standards for Science and Technology/Engineering, an informal survey of biology faculty, and assignments for the biology labs. The Instructional Design Librarian created multiple modules that engaged users through text, images, audio, and interactive tutorials. The researchers used Universal Design for Learning principles to address multiple learning styles, specifically multiple means of representation, and created a mapping technique for those principles that can be applied to any library tutorial. To assess the effectiveness, students with learning disabilities completed a usability test on the tutorial.

AB  - The basic premise underlying this research is that scientific phenomena are best learned by creating an external representation that complies with the complex and dynamic nature of such phenomena. Effective representations are assumed to incorporate three key characteristics: they are graphical, dynamic, and provide a pre-specified outline of the domain. This study examined the impact of these characteristics on performance and learning. High school students first read an instructional text about glucose--insulin regulation and then created a representation of its content. Representations differed regarding the key characteristics such that the summary (n = 15), concept map (n = 16), model (n = 23), and outlined model (n = 21) all incorporated one additional characteristic compared to their precursor. Main results indicated learning effects in each of these four conditions. Furthermore, creating a model was found to enhance students' learning more than creating a concept map, and students who completed an outlined model were found to learn more than those who created a model from scratch. In conclusion, this study does not univocally verify the necessity of all key characteristics individually, but the results do show that a representational format that combines all key characteristics enhances learning more than other formats.

AB  - Objectives: This article reports the first science mapping analysis of the social work field, which shows its conceptual structure and scientific evolution. Methods: Science Mapping Analysis Software Tool, a bibliometric science mapping tool based on co-word analysis and h-index, is applied using a sample of 18,794 research articles published from 1930 to 2012 in 25 main social work journals indexed in the "Journal Citation Reports" of the "Web of Science." Results: Published research social work field concentrated in eight main thematic areas: children, social services, health care, violence, women, HIV/AIDS, social workers, and education. HIV/AIDS and violence have recently attracted the interest of the social word scientific community, while the rest are classical thematic areas that still attract the interest and efforts of the researchers. Conclusion: This conceptual and empirical analysis shows how research themes have evolved in social work.

AB  - As a discipline, chemistry enjoys a unique position. While many academic areas prepared "cooperative examinations" in the 1930s, only chemistry maintained the activity within what has become the ACS Examinations Institute. As a result, the long-term existence of community-built, norm-referenced, standardized exams provides a historical artifact about the nature of content coverage in courses that stretches over decades. This work reports efforts to capture information and formulate it into a database about general chemistry content coverage over the past 20 years. Roughly 2000 items have been characterized in several ways, including (i) content, using an Anchoring Concepts Content Map; (ii) item construct, such as the presence of symbolic or visual information; and (iii) cognitive processing required, in terms of recall, algorithmic, or conceptual thinking.

AB  - This case study explored the development of two pre-service teachers' subject matter knowledge (SMK) of electromagnetism while integrating the use of concept maps (CM) and collaborative learning (CL) strategies. The study aimed at capturing how these pre-service teachers' SMK in electromagnetism was enhanced after having been taught SMK in a university module on electromagnetism via a lecture mode. The participants' progress in acquiring SMK was monitored when they engaged in individual-constructivist learning and socio-constructivist learning when working in pairs. Data were collected from concept maps on electromagnetism and from individual interviews. This interpretive case study suggests that the participants benefitted in several ways in consolidating their SMK of electromagnetism through integrating CM activities and engaging in CL. These benefits included the revision of previous work; the reflection on choices of the big conceptual ideas in electromagnetism; making appropriate conceptual connections supported by experiments; using new terminology in conceptual linkages; sharing ideas via arguing and explaining to each other; and consolidating learning by drawing and extending concept maps over time. The study suggests that the pre-service teachers did benefit from both the individual constructivist and socio-constructivist approaches in consolidating their SMK through the integrated CL and CM activities.

AB  - While educational design research promotes closer links between practice and theory, reporting its outcomes from iterations across multiple contexts is often constrained by the volumes of data generated, and the context bound nature of the research outcomes. Reports tend to focus on a single iteration of implementation without further research to determine the generalisability of the outcomes to new contexts. This paper outlines a retrospective analytical approach used to capture the significant design features of an online orientation resource implemented in one university context, and then adapted for further exploration, design and evaluation at a second contrasting university. The educational problem studied was how to support health science students to overcome barriers of transitioning to online distance study. A conjecture mapping process aligned to the three phases of educational design research provided a framework to review the outcomes at the first university. This guided the research at the second university, including choice of the data sources during implementation. This process enabled the researcher to undertake a comparative analysis and evaluate the extent of generalisability of the resource to the second university, leading to refined design principles and a framework that illustrates the student transition process.

AB  - Teaching students to use and interpret representations in science is critically important if they are to become scientifically literate and learn how to communicate their understandings and learning in science. This study involved 248 students (119 boys and 129 girls) from 26 grade 6 teachers' classes in nine primary schools in Brisbane, Australia. Teachers were randomly allocated by school to one of three conditions: the contemporary science + representations condition (Experimental[superscript a]), the contemporary condition (Experimental[superscript b]), or the comparison condition as they participated in an eight-week inquiry-science unit on Natural Disasters. Data on students' discourse were collected at two time points during the implementation of the unit and data on the concept maps were collected pre- and post-intervention while data on the reasoning and problem-solving (RP-S) task were collected following the intervention. The results show that when students participate in an inquiry-based science unit that is augmented with a variety of multimedia resources presenting a range of current contemporary events (Experimental[superscript a] and Experimental[superscript b] conditions), they demonstrate significantly more social language and basic scientific language and marked increases in moderate scientific language than their peers in the comparison condition. Interestingly, although there were no significant differences on the Personal Concept Map scores between the conditions at Times 1 and 2, the students' scores in all conditions improved decidedly across time. It appears that as the children had more time to engage with the material, participate in cooperative peer discussions, and receive encouragement from their teachers to provide elaborated feedback to each other, their conceptual understandings of earthquakes were enhanced. However, although the children in the experimental conditions demonstrated significantly more social and scientific language than their peers in the comparison condition, these oral language skills did not transfer to the RP-S task, possibly because they may not have had enough time to consolidate their application in a novel context where they had to work independently.

AB  - This article reports on a study investigating how postsecondary students interact with mathematical proofs with a focus on how they go about unpacking a "received proof," how they make meaning from what they are given, and whether they believe that mathematical meaning can be drawn from such proofs. Case studies were conducted with seven non-mathematics majors of varying mathematical competence. Data sources included semistructured interviews aimed at exploring their knowledge, beliefs, and learning approach regarding received mathematical proofs. This included engaging them in "proof mapping." The findings discussed here are based on two of the participants who had seen some basic mathematics proofs and their beliefs about received proofs. The study shows that though both students displayed a respect for proofs, their beliefs indicated that they had not received or understood their importance in mathematics education. Moreover, they believed that their efforts to engage with received proofs are largely self-created, based on modeling classroom discussions. Implications are discussed for teaching through received proofs.

AB  - General chemistry is the first undergraduate course in which students further develop their understanding of fundamental chemical concepts. Many of these fundamental topics highlight the numerous conceptual interconnections present in chemistry. However, many students possess incoherent knowledge structures regarding these topics. Therefore, effective assessments are needed to identify these interconnections. The use of concept-mapping and think-aloud interviews to investigate the knowledge structures of undergraduate organic chemistry students' regarding bonding concepts is the focus of this research study. Herein, we spotlight the bonding concepts of electronegativity and polar covalent bonds. In essence, the study found that understanding of electronegativity was weak among students with low concept map scores (LS students) compared to students with high concept map scores (HS students). Additionally, several common misconceptions of electronegativity were revealed through student interviews. An examination of LS student interviews further revealed that a lack of understanding of electronegativity led to a misunderstanding of polar covalent bonding. The think-aloud interviews were a reflection of the connections students made with the concepts of electronegativity and polar covalent bonding in their concept maps. Implications for the chemistry curriculum are also presented.

AB  - Following collaboration between two chemistry lecturers and an academic developer an attempt was made to enhance the learning of students within a chemistry module through the adaptation of the delivery of content material. This paper reports a piece of practitioner led research which considered how effective the approach developed was upon the level of student understanding and the process through which this occurred. The module delivery was altered from an emphasis on the transmission of knowledge through a traditional lecture format, to rotating small group problem based sessions and the use of concept maps. Student feedback and higher grades achieved appear to demonstrate it was effective.

AB  - Recent school science curriculum developments in many countries emphasise that scientists derive evidence for their claims through different approaches; that such practices are bound up with disciplinary knowledge; and that the quality of data should be appreciated. This position paper presents an understanding of the validity of data as a set of conceptual relationships, illustrating the application of the network of ideas and their inter-relationships necessary for the "thinking behind the doing" with examples from practice. We explore ways in which this understanding of data is inherently related to underpinning disciplinary ideas. We suggest how the recognition of a conceptual basis for understanding the quality of data represents an ontological shift with respect to widespread characterisations of scientific practices which addresses some long-standing issues in science education research, policy, curricula and practice.

AB  - Background: Literature contends that a teacher's knowledge of concept map-based tasks influence how their students perceive the task and execute the creation of acceptable concept maps. Teachers who are skilled concept mappers are able to (1) understand and apply the operational terms to construct a hierarchical/non-hierarchical concept map; (2) identify the legitimacy of the constructed concept map by verifying its graphical structure and its educational utility; and (3) determine the inherent "good" and "poor" qualities of the resulting graphical structure to reiterate the "good" qualities and to coach and provide feedback to alleviate "poor" qualities. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of prospective teachers' knowledge underpinning the technique used to construct concept maps and thus, explicate their facility to construct concept maps. Sample, Design and Methods: Data consisted of 200 concept maps constructed by prospective teachers in an elementary science methods course. Results: Analysis revealed that the prospective teachers had predominantly constructed either hierarchical and/or non-hierarchical concept maps. It is likely that their maps reflect the teaching that they themselves would have experienced in their science classrooms during their own education. Additionally, most of these concepts maps only contained the root concept and subordinate concepts and lacked directional linking lines, linking phrases, labelled lines and propositions. Conclusions: We argue that teacher educators need to assess their prospective teachers' understanding of concept mapping in relation to the legitimacy (the nature and quality) of the end-products (graphical structures) of such practices. Prospective teachers also need to understand the educational utility of concept mapping in terms of how these end-products impact and/or effectuate learning.

AB  - While gamification is gaining ground in business, marketing, corporate management, and wellness initiatives, its application in education is still an emerging trend. This article presents a study of the published empirical research on the application of gamification to education. The study is limited to papers that discuss explicitly the effects of using game elements in specific educational contexts. It employs a systematic mapping design. Accordingly, a categorical structure for classifying the research results is proposed based on the extracted topics discussed in the reviewed papers. The categories include gamification design principles, game mechanics, context of applying gamification (type of application, educational level, and academic subject), implementation, and evaluation. By mapping the published works to the classification criteria and analyzing them, the study highlights the directions of the currently conducted empirical research on applying gamification to education. It also indicates some major obstacles and needs, such as the need for proper technological support, for controlled studies demonstrating reliable positive or negative results of using specific game elements in particular educational contexts, etc. Although most of the reviewed papers report promising results, more substantial empirical research is needed to determine whether both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation of the learners can be influenced by gamification.

AB  - This study was an attempt to examine the effect of concept mapping on reading comprehension of Iranian EFL learners. Pretest-posttest design was employed to scrutinize the possible improvement of the study's participants who were male and female learners whose ages ranged from 19 to 40 and had taken general English courses at Islamic Azad University of Kharg. Two groups (one experimental and one control group) were exposed to the same reading comprehension test as the pre-and post-test, however, only the experimental group received the special treatment of concept mapping techniques for different texts during the treatment. After the application of the study's treatment, data analysis procedure initiated which indicated that experimental group who received explicit concept mapping instruction had a better performance than the control group on the final reading comprehension test. In addition, the findings shows that students who used this strategy during the seven-week treatment had better results on comprehension reading test and could understand the reading passages better. The findings imply that concept maps can positively affect the reading comprehension ability of Iranian advanced EFL learners. It was also revealed that female learners were superior at employing concept-maps in comparison with their male peers.

AB  - Differentiated assessment (DA) seeks to address the individual differences between students and provides them with the appropriate assessment strategy. This paper looks into the possibility of implementing differentiated assessment in a public college in Oman. Additionally, it attempts to explore teachers' views about the possibility of implementing DA and to what extent do they support the idea of using DA and why. Further, it strives to identify some institutional, instructional and pedagogical challenges which might hinder the implementation of differentiated assessment and to find some best possible ways and strategies for implementing it in this context in question. A questionnaire was administered to 40 teachers to answer the study questions and to propose an assessment model on differentiated assessment. The results revealed that all the participants strongly support the idea of implementing the use of differentiated assessment in the Department of English Language and Literature (DELL), however, there are many institutional and pedagogical challenges need to be considered. Some recommendations and pedagogical implications were presented.

AB  - Students bring with them their own misconceptions to the science classes and it becomes a barrier in developing new concepts. Therefore, identifying misconceptions is an essential component in teaching science. The objective of this study was to identify 10th grade students' misconceptions on plant transport with the use of two-tier diagnostic test. The development procedure of the two-tier diagnostic test had three steps; (i) defining the content boundaries of the test (ii) collecting information on student misconceptions and (iii) instrument development. Student alternative conceptions were collected after interviewing 25 students and multiple choice questions with free responses being administered to the students. With the use of the date obtained, sixteen (08) two-tier multiple test items were constructed. The first tier examined the content knowledge and the second tier the reasons for the content. The conceptual knowledge examined in the test items were water absorption, mineral salt absorption, transportation of water, transpiration, organic food transportation. The diagnostic test was administered to 180, 10th grade students. It was revealed that students possessed 18 misconceptions. The highest number of misconceptions was recorded in the areas of organic food transportation and the transpiration. The most common misconception was found in the area of organic food transportation.

AB  - This study describes the process of defining a hypothetical learning progression (LP) for astronomy around the big idea of "Solar System formation." At the most sophisticated level, students can explain how the formation process led to the current Solar System by considering how the planets formed from the collapse of a rotating cloud of gas and dust. Development of this LP was conducted in 2 phases. First, we interviewed middle school, high school, and college students (N?=?44), asking them to describe properties of the current Solar System and to explain how the Solar System was formed. Second, we interviewed 6th-grade students (N?=?24) before and after a 15-week astronomy curriculum designed around the big idea. Our analysis provides evidence for potential levels of sophistication within the hypothetical LP, while also revealing common alternative conceptions or areas of limited understanding that could form barriers to progress if not addressed by instruction. For example, many students' understanding of Solar System phenomena was limited by either alternative ideas about gravity or limited application of momentum in their explanations. Few students approached a scientific-level explanation, but their responses revealed possible stepping stones that could be built upon with appropriate instruction.

AB  - This study explored the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and its development of four experienced biology teachers in the context of teaching school genetics. PCK was defined in terms of teacher content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and knowledge of students' preconceptions and learning difficulties. Data sources of teacher knowledge base included teacher-constructed concept maps, pre- and post-lesson teacher interviews, video-recorded genetics lessons, post-lesson teacher questionnaire and document analysis of teacher's reflective journals and students' work samples. The results showed that the teachers' individual PCK profiles consisted predominantly of declarative and procedural content knowledge in teaching basic genetics concepts. Conditional knowledge, which is a type of meta-knowledge for blending together declarative and procedural knowledge, was also demonstrated by some teachers. Furthermore, the teachers used topic-specific instructional strategies such as context-based teaching, illustrations, peer teaching, and analogies in diverse forms but failed to use physical models and individual or group student experimental activities to assist students' internalization of the concepts. The finding that all four teachers lacked knowledge of students' genetics-related preconceptions was equally significant. Formal university education, school context, journal reflection and professional development programmes were considered as contributing to the teachers' continuing PCK development. Implications of the findings for biology teacher education are briefly discussed.

AB  - Students need to think and work across disciplinary boundaries in the twenty-first century. However, it is unclear what interdisciplinary thinking means and how to analyze interdisciplinary interactions in teamwork. In this paper, drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives and empirical analysis of discourse contents, we formulate a theoretical framework that helps analyze interdisciplinary reasoning and communication (IRC) processes in interdisciplinary collaboration. Specifically, we propose four interrelated IRC processes--"integration," "translation," "transfer," and "transformation," and develop a corresponding analytic framework. We apply the framework to analyze two meetings of a project that aims to develop interdisciplinary science assessment items. The results illustrate that the framework can help interpret the interdisciplinary meeting dynamics and patterns. Our coding process and results also suggest that these IRC processes can be further examined in terms of interconnected sub-processes. We also discuss the implications of using the framework in conceptualizing, practicing, and researching interdisciplinary learning and teaching in science education.

AB  - Context-based education, in which students deal with biological concepts in a meaningful way, is showing promise in promoting the development of students' conceptual coherence. However, literature gives little guidance about how this kind of education should be designed. Therefore, our study aims at designing and evaluating the practicability of a context-based biology lesson sequence. Four design principles for conceptual coherence were defined: build upon familiar concepts; focus on core concepts; stimulate establishing connections between concepts; and reflect on these connections. These design principles have been elaborated into a lesson sequence about concepts related to cellular metabolism and the relevant connections between the concepts have been visualised in a reference concept map. The activities of teacher and students that were expected to contribute in establishing these connections were described in a research scenario. The lesson sequence was conducted in a 10th-grade class of 21 students, aged 15-16, in senior general secondary education. Data were collected from video-recordings in the classroom. The observed activities of the teacher and students were compared with the intended activities. The findings show that a research scenario is a powerful tool to systematically evaluate the design and to provide information for improving it.

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of students' academic achievement on identified difficult concepts or topics in Senior Secondary School Biology in Delta State, Nigeria. The study was quasi-experimental and the design was a 2X2 factorial non-randomized pretest-posttest control group design. The sample was drawn from intact classes from four coeducational schools located in urban and rural centres in Delta Central Senatorial District. A total of 160 male and female students were used in the study. The sample were got using purposive sampling technique. The instrument for the study was designed by the researchers and tagged Biology Achievement Test (BAT). This was validated by experts and Kuder-Richardson formula 21 was used for the reliability estimate and this yielded 0.71 alpha. This was tested at 0.05 significant level. The methods used for evaluating the students was Concept-mapping and the Regular Teaching Methods, as experimental and control groups respectively. The results showed that students perceived some topics like Hereditary, Genetics, Ecology as difficult while it was found out that gender (male and female sex) and school location (urban and rural) had no effect on difficult concepts in Biology. Based on these, recommendations were made; such as innovative teaching strategies like concept mapping be used in our classrooms.

AB  - The performance in chemistry at tertiary level in Zambia has not been as expected. It has therefore been a matter of concern. There has been a continuous focus on exploring new teaching strategies to improve the understanding of this difficult subject. This study investigated the effectiveness of composite use of concept maps and traditional method on student achievement in selected topics in chemistry. The study was conducted in view of determining the method which is more effective in enhancing student understanding in chemistry. There were three groups involved in the study i.e., Control, experimental group 1 and experimental group 2. The pre-test, post-test true experimental research design was used for the study. The sample of the study consisted of thirty nine (39) first year students at Mufulira College of education. Each of the three groups was randomly assigned 13 students. The treatment took four weeks using the topics "atomic structure" and "chemical bonding". The control group was treated using the traditional method, the experimental group 1 was treated using the concept map method while experimental group 2 used composite of both the traditional and concept map methods. One way ANOVA at an alpha (a) = 0.05 was conducted to analyze the results of the pre-test and post test scores. The means of the pre-test scores were; control group = 6.46, Experimental group 1 = 7.07 and experimental group 2 = 6.61. These results show that there was no significant difference in the performance of the students in all groups. This result implied that the entry level performance for all the groups was not significantly different. The means of the post-test results (control group = 4.53, experimental group 1 = 5.46, experimental group 2 = 6.61) showed that there was a significant effect on the use of both traditional teaching method and concept map teaching method at p < 0.05 level for the three groups at F(2,36) = 17.156, p = 0.00. The experimental group 2 performed better than both control group and experimental group 1 in the post test scores. Post hoc comparisons using the Turkey HSD test indicated that the mean scores were significantly different. The results strongly support that when students are taught using both the concept map teaching strategy and traditional teaching strategy, they achieve the best scores. This study therefore offers an encouraging solution towards improvement of student performance in Chemistry at tertiary level.

AB  - When entering the classroom, adolescents already hold various conceptions on science topics. Concept maps may function as useful tools to reveal such conceptions although labor-intensive analysis often prevents application in typical classroom situations. The authors aimed to provide teachers with an appropriate approach to analyze students' concept maps within daily school routine. They intended to conclude qualitative changes from analyzing quantitative parameters. To test the approach, high school students were asked to map their conceptions before and after attending an educational program on climate change. For the analyses, quantitative as well as qualitative methods were applied. A comparison of pre- and postmaps pointed to a conceptual change. From strong correlations between qualitative and quantitative parameters we assumed our approach to be applicable. Due to its simple and barely time-consuming handling, the authors' approach is suitable for application in conventional classroom situations and may contribute to inform teachers about students' conceptions.

AB  - Concept mapping is a pedagogical technique that was developed in the 1970s and is being used in K-12 and postsecondary education. Although it has shown excellent results in other fields, it is still rare in political science. In this research note, I discuss the implementation and testing of concept mapping in my Advanced Introduction to International Relations course. I find that student self-reporting indicates that this approach has a positive impact on student comprehension of texts and learning in the course. I suggest improvements that I intend to implement with the technique, as well as a future research agenda.

AB  - This paper proposes several activities that encourage self-learning in engineering courses. For each activity, the context and the pedagogical issues addressed are described emphasizing strengths and weaknesses. Specifically, this work describes and implements five activities, which are: questionnaires, conceptual maps, videos, jigsaw and projects. These activities are applied in seven different knowledge fields and are conducted individually or in group depending on the nature of the subject and of the activity. Furthermore, this paper shows how the same activity can be applied in subjects of different years and how the implementation level changes, depending on the course in which it is conducted. The activities proposed have been introduced in engineering courses, but they can also be applied in any other knowledge field. Finally, the paper proposes four rubrics to assess three of the proposed activities (videos, jigsaw and project), being two of them for the project activity.

AB  - Concept mapping has long been used an assessment tool by educators to illustrate students' conceptual development of a topic over time. In this article, we chronicle the use of concept maps in a language arts environment. Focusing on a literacy tutoring program for struggling readers/writers centered on hands-on science experiments, we explain how concept maps were used as tools to engage students in authentic writing. Using the example of one struggling reader/writer, step-by-step instructions are provided used by the student's literacy tutor to transform ideas captured on a concept map (generated from experiments and readings about magnets) into a student-written non-fiction, informational book. Results from the student's pre- and post-writing assessments not only show increased writing abilities, but also mastery of science language demands.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to examine the effect of teacher read-aloud on adolescent learning in science and variation according to individual reading ability. The study gathered both quantitative and qualitative data for analysis from 2 treatment procedures. All seventh and eighth grade students participated in 2 consecutive units of study: 1 unit requiring students to read the science text silently and the second unit providing a teacher read-aloud of all text. The classroom procedures, assignments, and related activities were exactly the same for both treatments. Student learning was measured with pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest concept map scores on each unit of study. A survey administered at the end of the study examined student attitudes toward the teacher read-aloud and served as the source for in-depth interviews concerning preference for or dislike of the teacher read-aloud strategy. A repeated measures analysis suggested both teacher read-aloud and silent reading were appropriate for student learning but results do not support either method as superior over the other. Multiple regression analyses were conducted on the posttest and delayed posttest scores as the dependent measured, had a significant relationship between treatment by reading ability interaction on one analysis. Regression equations constructed for each level of the treatment indicated that as reading ability increases, students received more benefits from the teacher read-aloud procedure. A correlation compared reading ability with attitude toward teacher read-aloud. Seventy-eight of the participants had a positive attitude toward the intervention, with no students reading below the 50th percentile showing disapproval. Interview responses supported these results since all below average readers favor the oral presentation. Overall themes from the interviews offered advantages and disadvantages of teacher read-aloud, suggestions for implementation, and a teacher's perspective on practical applications in science classes.

AB  - Chemistry has been looked upon as a challenging subject by teachers, students and researchers because of the abstract nature of content in chemistry, teaching styles applied in class, and the difficulty of the language of chemistry. Cognitive load for the novice learner has a significant role in creating difficulties in chemistry learning. Cognitive strategies that teachers use as part of instruction may reduce the cognitive load and enhance learning the novel chemistry concepts. The sample sizes were 48 in experimental group and 48 in control group. The experimental group was taught by cognitive strategies like analogies, concept map, concept cartoons, story lines, worked examples, and puzzles to teach organic chemistry which is unfamiliar to them so far. The control group received constructivist mode of teaching. The impact of cognitive strategies was measured on chemistry outcomes like achievement, attitude and self-efficacy. Results showed that cognitive strategies have significantly enhanced the achievement, attitude and self-efficacy in organic chemistry.

AB  - Background and purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate and identify the nature and the interrelatedness of pre-service teachers' misconceptions and scientific concepts for explaining dissolving before, during, and after a 5E learning cycle lesson on dissolving, the intervention. Sample, design, and methods: Guided by Vygotsky's theory of concept development, the study focused specifically on the spontaneous, and spontaneous pseudo-concepts held by the 61 elementary pre-service teachers during a 15-week science methods course. Data included concept maps, interview transcripts, written artifacts, drawings, and narratives, and were thematically analyzed to classify concepts and interrelatedness. Results: Results of the study showed that spontaneous pseudo-concepts (1) dominated pre-service teachers' understandings about dissolving throughout the study, and (2) were simply associated with scientific concepts during and after the intervention. Conclusion: Collectively, the results indicated that the pre-service teachers' did not acquire a unified system of knowledge about dissolving that could be characterized as abstract, generalizable, and hierarchical. Implications include the need for (1) familiarity with pre-service teachers' prior knowledge about science content; (2) a variety of formative assessments to assess their misconceptions; (3) emphasizing the importance of dialectical method for concept development during instruction; and (4) skillful content instructors.

AB  - Background: Today, for most of us, technology is a vital and inevitable part of our lives. Due to its widespread use, a great emphasis is being given to educating generations about technology. And, every individual has his/her own style of organizing and collecting information. Purpose: The purpose of the present study is to identify the relationship between pre-service science teachers' cognitive styles and their cognitive structures about technology. Sample: The study was conducted with the participation of first and third grade pre-service science teachers majoring in Science Education in the Faculty of Education at Abant Izzet Baysal University in the spring semester of 2012-2013. Design and methods: The study was designed as a case study and a qualitative research method was used. Students were administered two instruments: Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) and a Word Association Test (WAT). Results: Results clearly suggested that the first grade participants with a field-dependent cognitive style were better at associating concepts when compared to those with a field-independent cognitive style. And, participants with a field-dependent style, could form more connections between the technology-related concepts. A comparison of the findings on the field-dependent participants by their grade demonstrated that the first and third grade participants with a field-dependent cognitive style got similar scores in terms of the total number of words generated for each key concept. Conclusions: Considering that education is for individuals, it is impossible to ignore individual differences during the process. The most interesting finding of the present study is that field-dependent individuals have a higher cognitive structure, unlike that which has been asserted so far in the literature.

AB  - University research education in many disciplines is frequently confronted by problems with students' weak level of understanding of research concepts. A mind map technique was used to investigate how students understand central methodological concepts of empirical, theoretical, qualitative and quantitative. The main hypothesis was that some students have a confused conception of empirical. The mind maps revealed that in the beginning of the course, 75% of the students hold a problematic conception of research, and after the half year course, still half of the participated students had problems with expressing a scientifically sound conception of research. In addition to general undevelopedness of the maps, a severe confused conception of drawing a link from empirical to qualitative or quantitative, but not to both, was found. This finding indicates that some students have problems with understanding the very basic and central concept of empirical.

AB  - The main issue of this paper is the discussion around the question "How can we teach and motivate the why-generation learners and the generation Z learners?". The aim of our project was to find out teaching and learning methods that teachers and learners can use in 21st century classroom. Strategies how to engage gen Y and gen Z learners in the learning process should be found. During our research various methods were used: problem based learning, project based learning, team work, inquiry based learning, interdisciplinary approach, experiments--from very simple and low cost experiments to computer based experiments and remote laboratories. It was found out, that generation Y so as gen Z learners can be motivated by various instructional methods based on their own activity. Their own doing seemed to be more important for them than learning itself. It is necessary to use educational materials including charts, graphic presentations, cartoons. Also it was found out that a very useful tool for our students can be the mind mapping. Mind maps and concept maps are not common during students instruction at secondary and high schools in the Czech republic. We prepared a set of concept maps on the basis of high school physics textbooks, from mechanics, molecular physics, via electricity and magnetism to optics, and nuclear physics. In this paper the outcomes of our project will be presented so as some examples of interdisciplinary modules that have been prepared--"real-world" physics modules with everyday life problems that can be integrated into the high school curriculum physics (physics in the kitchen, crime scene investigation, environmental physics), non-traditional experiments, properties of non-Newtonian liquids (experiments with dilatant fluids, oobleck, the suspension of starch, the Weissenberg effect, Barus effect, the Kaye effect), modern physics--nanotechnology (cooperation with the Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials--a faculty establishment). The findings of this project are incorporated into the subject "Didactics of Physics" in the undergraduate physics teacher study programme at the Faculty of Science.

AB  - This study explored the perceptions, attitudes, and willingness of pre-service science teachers in the College of Education at Kuwait University about using concept/mind maps and its related application software as facilitative tools, for teaching and learning, in science education. The first level (i.e., reaction) of Kirkpatrick's/Phillips' classic 5-level evaluation research model was exploited to assess and validate the reaction-based satisfaction level of pre-service science teachers. Although the findings disclose that 74.2 percent of participants asserted being aware about concept/mind maps beforehand. However, the vast majority, 96.8 percent, affirmed that they are not aware about concept/mind mapping application software. The results indicate that all participants were highly satisfied with utilizing concept/mind mapping and its related applications in education, accordingly, their reaction- based satisfaction level was extremely positive and significantly high among all subgroups. The participants favored utilizing such tools for constructing their concept/mind maps over hand-drawing or regular desktop productivity applications. Also, all participants do consider that concept/mind maps and its related application software as being appropriate, valuable, and useful facilitative and enhancement tools in education. They also do believe that these tools are important constituents for promoting thrive and success in science education.

AB  - Knowledge is not simply a collection of facts, principles, and formulas; instead, meaningful knowledge is organized around core concepts that guide peoples' thinking about a subject. Therefore, knowledge organization is recognized as an important component of understanding learning and teaching. In this research, knowledge organization of two physics university textbooks was compared with that of four physics university teachers. The topic studied was magnetostatics with an emphasis on two topics of Biot-Savart law and Ampère's law. The aim of study was to examine the structural features of the subject matter knowledge of teachers and textbooks. For this reason, concept maps were utilized to picture clearly their knowledge organizations. Concept maps were evaluated by means of a focus on their structural characteristics including hierarchy and clustering. Results indicate that the hierarchical organizations between knowledge of teachers and textbooks vary from one topic to another. The hierarchical organizations of teachers are more comparable to textbooks for the topic of Biot-Savart law. The clustering behaves in a very similar way in the case of patterns between textbooks and teachers for both topics. It was observed that the knowledge arrangements of Ampère's law were more hierarchical, while the knowledge organizations of Biot-Savart were more clustered. Moreover, structural properties varied from one topic to another, even though topics belong to the same context. The possibility of recognizing such difference in knowledge organization is a first step towards developing more effective teaching and learning solutions.

AB  - This study examines the effectiveness of Neurocognitive Based Concept Mapping (NBCM) on students' learning in a science course. A total of 32 grade IX of high school Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) students were involved in this study by pre-test and post-test measurements. They were divided into two groups: NBCM group as an experimental group and non- NBCM group as a control group. Both the groups were pre-tested with the basic knowledge on the topics "The fundamental unit of life & Is matter around us pure" before instruction. The control group was treated with routine traditional method of teaching whereas the experimental group was instructed with NCBC for three weeks. The researchers were developed a new strategy of teaching science through advanced concept mapping called Neurocognitive Based Concept Mapping for the first time and this strategy was adopted to the experimental group in the post test. The results were analysed using Sciences statistical techniques by Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software. The experimental study revealed that extremely statistically significant between pre-test and post test at 0.01 level of significance. Hence neurocognitive based concept mapping strategy enhances the students to secure good scores and this strategy can be implemented to various level of subjects as well as students.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of Concept Mapping-Guided Discovery Integrated Teaching Approach on the achievement and retention of chemistry students. The sample comprised 162 Senior Secondary two (SS 2) students drawn from two Science Schools in Nasarawa State, Central Nigeria with equivalent mean scores of 9.68 and 9.49 in their pre-test. Five instruments were developed, validated and used by the investigator for the study; they are namely; Chemistry Achievement Pre-Test (CAPE), Chemistry Achievement Post-Test (CAPO), Chemistry Achievement Retention Test (CART), Lesson Plans for the Control Group (LPCG) and the Lesson Plan for the Experimental Group (LPEG). Pre-test / post-test control group design was employed. Results of the Scheffe's test for multiple comparisons revealed that boys in the experimental group performed better than girls in the experimental group. The results of the t-test analysis of the retention test showed that the mean score of the experimental group was significantly better than that of the control group (p<0.05). It is strongly recommended that chemistry teachers should be encouraged to adopt this method for teaching difficult concepts.

AB  - Over the past two decades, science educators increasingly have become interested in the role of language in the learning of science and have drawn on the work of Bakhtin, among others, for understanding the dialogical nature of knowledge in a sociocultural framework. However, the nature of language and its relation to thinking have not substantially changed and, in many ways, are incommensurable with the cultural-historical, materialist dialectical underpinning of the original framing of the sociocultural and dialogical approaches in the theories of L. S. Vygotsky and M. M. Bakhtin and his circle (e.g., V. N. Vološinov). Most importantly, currently available analyses of science classroom talk do not appear to exhibit sufficient appreciation of the fact that words, statements, and language are living phenomena, that is, they inherently change in speaking. In this paper, I begin by working out the premise that language is a living phenomenon that changes in use. I then present two key insights on language-in-use that derive from the works of Vygotsky and the Bakhtin circle, which are used to develop a theoretical and methodological frame. These key insights and the theoretical aspects of this paper are exemplified with materials from a concept mapping session in a 12th-grade physics course. The proposed model has considerable implications for theorizing the relation between classroom talk and formal written genres of expression, and gives rise to many new research questions.

AB  - Two different versions of "big ideas" rooted content maps have recently been published for general chemistry. As embodied in the content outline from the College Board, one of these maps is designed to guide curriculum development and testing for advanced placement (AP) chemistry. The Anchoring Concepts Content Map for general chemistry from the ACS Exams Institute is a component of a larger content map for the four-year undergraduate curriculum. This article compares the structure and content in these two maps to provide perspective on the current nature of the general chemistry curriculum.

AB  - Students typically create concept maps while they view the material they are trying to learn. In these circumstances, concept mapping serves as an elaborative study activity--students are not required to retrieve the material they are learning. In 2 experiments, we examined the effectiveness of concept mapping when it is used as a retrieval practice activity. In Experiment 1, students read educational texts and practiced retrieval either by writing down as many ideas as they could recall in paragraph format or by creating a concept map (retrieval-based concept mapping). In Experiment 2, we factorially crossed the format of the activity (paragraph vs. concept map) and the presence or absence of the text (i.e., whether the activity involved repeated studying or retrieval practice). On a final test 1 week later that assessed verbatim knowledge and inferencing, both paragraph and concept map retrieval practice formats produced better performance than additional studying, but the 2 retrieval formats themselves did not differ. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of concept mapping when it is used as a retrieval practice activity and show that retrieval itself, rather than merely the act of writing, drives the benefits of retrieval-based learning activities.

AB  - Chemistry courses remain a challenge for many undergraduate students. In particular, first-semester organic chemistry has been labeled as a gatekeeper with high attrition rates, especially among students of color. Our study examines a key factor related to conceptual understanding in science and predictive of course outcomes-knowledge structures. Previous research on knowledge structures has focused on differences between experts and novices. Given the increasing ethnic diversity of college classrooms and research indicating unique differences in certain higher order cognitive processes associated cultural practices and ethnicity, it is important to investigate whether similar patterns exist with respect to knowledge structures. Our study utilized concept maps to measure knowledge structures. Two separate analyses where performed to determine whether or not ethnically diverse students' organize their knowledge of organic chemistry content in structurally different ways. The first analysis utilized concept map proposition scoring to examine the influence of prior science achievement and ethnicity on knowledge structures. The second analysis examined holistic map structures to determine whether or not ethnically diverse students show qualitatively distinct structures overall. Results show significant mean differences on concept map proposition scores related to both prior science achievement and ethnic group membership. However, examination of holistic structures revealed that students' qualitative holistic structures did not vary by ethnic group membership. Taken together, our findings suggest that variation in students' knowledge structures are related to prior science achievement across ethnic groups, not qualitative differences in the ways ethnically diverse students' structure knowledge. Implications for teaching and learning in organic chemistry are discussed.

AB  - Improving students scientific explanations is one major goal of science education. Both writing activities and concept mapping are reported as effective strategies for enhancing student learning of science. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a teaching model, named the DCI model, which integrates a Descriptive explanation writing activity, Concept mapping, and an Interpretive explanation writing activity, is introduced in a 4th grade science class to see if it would improve students' scientific explanations and understanding. A quasi-experimental design, including a non-randomized comparison group and a pre- and post-test design, was adopted for this study. An experimental group of 25 students were taught using the DCI teaching model, while a comparison group received a traditional lecture teaching. A rubric and content analysis was used to assess students' scientific explanations. The independent sample t test was used to measure difference in conceptual understanding between the two groups, before and after instruction. Then, the paired t test analysis was used to understand the promotion of the DCI teaching model. The results showed that students in the experimental group performed better than students in the comparison group, both in scientific concept understanding and explanation. Suggestions for using concept mapping and writing activities (the DCI teaching model) in science classes are provided in this study.

AB  - We evaluate a new approach to teaching the basic biochemistry mechanisms that regulate the biology of Triatominae, major vectors of "Trypanosoma cruzi," the causative agent of Chagas disease. We have designed and used a comic book, "Carlos Chagas: 100 years after a hero's discovery" containing scientific information obtained by seven distinguished contemporary Brazilian researchers working with Triatominaes. Students (22) in the seventh grade of a public elementary school received the comic book. The study was then followed up by the use of Concept Maps elaborated by the students. Six Concept Maps elaborated by the students before the introduction of the comic book received an average score of 7. Scores rose to an average of 45 after the introduction of the comic book. This result suggests that a more attractive content can greatly improve the knowledge and conceptual understanding among students not previously exposed to insect biochemistry. In conclusion, this study illustrates an alternative to current strategies of teaching about the transmission of neglected diseases. It also promotes the diffusion of the scientific knowledge produced by Brazilian researchers that may stimulate students to choose a scientific career.

AB  - This paper introduces the MAPLET framework that was developed to map and link teaching aims, learning processes, learner expertise and technologies. An experimental study with 65 participants is reported to test the effectiveness of the framework as a guide to the design of lessons embedded within larger units of study. The findings indicate the potential of the MAPLET framework and reinforces the need to take a fresh approach to the design and development of curriculum that makes more effective use of the diminishing time available. It provides a conceptual model and working procedure that places the learner and the process of learning at the forefront of decisions.

AB  - Problem solving is a highly valued skill in chemistry. Courses within this discipline place a substantial emphasis on problem-solving performance and tend to weigh such performance heavily in assessments of learning. Researchers have dedicated considerable effort investigating individual factors that influence problem-solving performance. The purpose of this study is to inspect the influences of a core set of factors (prior science achievement, knowledge structures, spatial ability, gender, and ethnicity) and their overall contributions to problem solving in organic chemistry using multivariate regression analyses. Results indicate that knowledge structures are a key predictor of problem-solving performance and account for a significant proportion of the variation in students' problem-solving scores. Implications for research and practice in chemistry are discussed.

AB  - This study explored elementary pre-service teachers' content knowledge for dissolving before and after an instructional intervention over a 15-week science methods course. Pre-service teacher knowledge was examined using pre/post concept maps (Cmaps) and drawings with narrative descriptions. A mixed methods approach was used for both data collection and analysis. All data were thematically analyzed and a paired t-test was conducted on all collected pre- and post- Cmaps. Results of the study showed that prior to the study, pre-Cmap data indicated that participants held misconceptions and scientific conceptions, while post-Cmap data revealed an 86% improvement in knowledge with substantial gains for scientific concepts (e.g., rate, reversibility, solutes/solvents, solution, and homogeneous distribution of particles). The t-test showed statistically significant differences between pre/post Cmap scores (t = -5.071, p < 0.001) with the instructional intervention larger for post-Cmap scores (M = 3.58; SD = 2.561) than for pre-Cmap scores (M = 0.67; SD = 1.278). The effect size was very large. Analysis of drawings and narratives demonstrated knowledge of the hydration shell structure and the concept that dissolving is a reversible process (76%). This study suggests that pre-service teachers may possess a mosaic of conceptual understanding that is not scientifically valid and that significant remediation through concrete learning experiences may be required to elevate prior knowledge before introducing abstract concepts.

AB  - In order to use concept maps in physics classes effectively, teachers' knowledge and ideas about concept mapping are as important as the physics knowledge used in mapping. For this reason, we aimed to examine pre-service physics teachers' knowledge on concept mapping, their ideas about the implementation of concept mapping in physics classes, the hidden elements influencing their ideas, and the relations between knowledge and ideas, qualitatively. The participants of this study were eight pre-service physics teachers enrolled in the physics education department at two state universities. The results of the interviews conducted with the participants and their artifacts revealed that although pre-service physics teachers had basic knowledge about concept mapping, they had some negative ideas about implementation in physics classes. Furthermore, language, limitation in assessment, limitation in expressions, and teacher's knowledge were identified as the sources of pre-service physics teachers' negative ideas.

AB  - A fundamental reason for doing evaluation capacity building (ECB) is to improve program outcomes. Developing common measures of outcomes and the activities, processes, and factors that lead to these outcomes is an important step in moving the science and the practice of ECB forward. This article identifies a number of existing ECB measurement tools and maps their concepts onto a common framework. This mapping clarifies consensus as well as facilitates selection of instruments and indicators for researchers and practitioners. The framework is an updated version of the Integrated ECB Model (IECB) that was developed from the ECB literature and used in a research synthesis of ECB empirical literature by the author and colleagues. The convergence of concepts revealed by the mapping understates the convergence with other models and literature as the mapping is limited to instruments and does not include concepts from other frameworks or the broader literature. ECB readiness and causal sequencing of activities and outcomes are explored by the use of factor analysis using data from the research synthesis. The findings suggest that the organizational outcomes of ECB include doing and using evaluations, planning future evaluations, and evaluating as part of staff jobs. Mainstreaming indicators were routinizing evaluation, providing opportunities to learn about evaluation, creating new relationships with other organizations and planning future ECB efforts. The results confirm that building evaluation capacity can be distinguished from mainstreaming and suggest that other factors such as evaluative and general organizational capacity, culture, leadership and funding are ECB readiness factors that can enhance ECB outcomes.

AB  - The "mole" is a fundamental concept in quantitative chemistry, yet research has shown that the mole is one of the most perplexing concepts in the teaching and learning of chemistry. This paper provides a survey of the relevant literature, identifies the necessary components of a sound understanding of the mole concept, and unpacks and presents these components in the form of a concept map. The concept map incorporates the atomic-molecular concept with the mole concept, and connects the two concepts by two linking ideas: the number aspect of the SI definition (linking idea 1) and the connection between relative atomic-molecular mass and molar mass (linking idea 2). This concept map not only provides a conceptual framework for making meaning in relation to the mole but also sheds some light on how the concept might be better taught and learned.

AB  - Knowledge structure is an important aspect for defining students' competency in biology learning, but how knowledge structure is influenced by the teaching process in naturalistic biology classroom settings has scarcely been empirically investigated. In this study, 49 biology lessons in the teaching unit "blood and circulatory system" in 9th grade German classrooms were videotaped and analyzed. Before the lesson, a questionnaire was administered to the students to solicit their responses about learning motivation. After the lesson, students' learning outcomes on knowledge structure were examined with the concept mapping method. The video coding used in this study focused on the knowledge linking levels during the biology lesson. Out of the 49 classes, those with the highest and those with the lowest linking levels were selected based on the coding results. In high-linking classes, interrelated facts were introduced more often in the lessons, whereas in the lessons of the low-linking classes, isolated pieces of knowledge were predominant. The results from the concept mapping task showed that the students in the high-linking classes constructed more correct relations among the concepts compared to the students in the low-linking classes. The results remained stable even after controlling for learning motivation. These findings confirm the importance of teaching interrelated facts and concepts instead of isolated facts for fostering students' knowledge structure. As a result, based on the Bavarian biology curriculum, we develop materials and programs to enable students, student teachers, and teachers to focus on interrelated facts and basic concepts instead of isolated facts in biology lessons.

AB  - Project Clarion, a Jacob K. Javits-funded project, focused on the scale-up of primary-grade science curricula. Curriculum units, based on an Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM), were developed for high-ability learners, but tried out with all students in Title I settings to study the efficacy of the units with all learners. The units focus on the development of students' conceptual understanding to undergird science content attainment. Teaching and learning models, such as concept formation and concept mapping were used to scaffold science learning and reasoning for appropriate curriculum differentiation. Science content mastery was measured using the Metropolitan Achievement Tests. Reasoning skills were measured using the Test of Critical Thinking. Understanding of macro-concepts and content attainment were measured by curriculum-embedded performance-based assessments. Students with the ICM outperformed students without the specialized curriculum in science content and reasoning skills, and showed greater growth in both conceptual understanding and content attainment.

AB  - These 2 studies investigate the extent to which an Embodied Mixed Reality Learning Environment (EMRELE) can enhance science learning compared to regular classroom instruction. Mixed reality means that physical tangible and digital components were present. The content for the EMRELE required that students map abstract concepts and relations onto their gestures and movements so that the concepts would become grounded in embodied action. The studies compare an immersive, highly interactive learning platform that uses a motion-capture system to track students' gestures and locomotion as they kinesthetically learn with a quality classroom experience (teacher and content were held constant). Two science studies are presented: chemistry titration and disease transmission. In the counterbalanced design 1 group received the EMRELE intervention, while the other group received regular instruction; after 3 days and a midtest, the interventions switched. Each study lasted for 6 days total, with 3 test points: pretest, midtest, and posttest. Analyses revealed that placement in the embodied EMRELE condition consistently led to greater learning gains (effect sizes ranged from 0.53 to 1.93), compared to regular instruction (effect sizes ranged from 0.09 to 0.37). Order of intervention did not affect the final outcomes at posttest. These results are discussed in relation to a new taxonomy of embodiment in educational settings. We hypothesize that the positive results are due to the embodiment designed into the lessons and the high degree of collaboration engendered by the co-located EMRELE.

AB  - This paper reports on the metaphors that 36 third-year university mathematics education students have about mathematics. These metaphors were investigated through a questionnaire with five open-ended items. An inductive analysis of the students' metaphors for mathematics indicated that students had well developed and complex metaphors about mathematics, mathematics learning, mathematics teaching and the mathematics teacher. Several common themes emerged, including the view that hard work, patience and perseverance are needed for success in mathematics. Some students emphasised their role in learning mathematics as active while others view their role of the teacher as crucial. Three mental images are common: firstly, the notion that mathematics learning is challenging and may involve anxiety; secondly, that perseverance is needed as continuing effort will bring reward; and lastly, that positive or negative mental images of mathematics are related to the perception of and the active vs passive role of the learner. Considering that the metaphors were collected from students with an extensive engagement with mathematics learning, the findings implied that these metaphors reflect the students' mental images formed as a result of experiencing mathematics learning.

AB  - Teacher-centred strategies have dominated most physics lessons in Lesotho. This study attempted to understand the contributing factors for the choice of teacher-centred teaching instead of learner-centred teaching with the goal of informing a professional development programme designed to address this problem. The paper responds to the research question: what challenges do physics teachers come across when they attempt to implement learner-centred strategies in their lessons? Four teachers, with varying teaching experience, participated in the study. Data were collected using written responses and audio and video recordings. Analysis of the data reflected two elements. First, the operational definitions of learner-centred strategies that teachers use lack components that are likely to influence their teaching. Second, teachers claim that time and student characteristics are some of the challenges that affect their choice of the teacher-centred approaches. Implications of these findings for both professional development providers and classroom practitioners are discussed.

AB  - As technologies have become an integral part of our lives, the way we read and understand text has changed drastically. In this paper, we discuss how various technologies support learners' reading and writing skills within the context of meaningful learning. Next, using elaborated cases, we argue that situating learners in problem solving environments and engaging them in authentic tasks has far-reaching benefits for learning as technologies play the role of cognitive tools in such environments.

AB  - This article sets out to describe the PROFILES project, a European Commission FP7 science and society project, addresses problems and issues in science education by guiding teachers to embrace a range of teaching factors, such as a context-based approach, motivational constructivist learning; student centred inquiry teaching; enhancing cognitive conceptualisation, and including socio-scientific decision making. The PROFILES project bases the teaching on a theoretically derived, 3 stage model, which is supported through carefully designed PROFILES modules, providing for both the students and the teacher. The major focus of the project is promoting more relevant school science education at the secondary level (grade 7 and above) by guiding teachers to gain ownership of the PROFILES philosophy and approach.

AB  - Recent studies in learning programming have largely focused on high school and college students; less is known about how young children learn to program. From video data of 20 students using a graphical programming interface, we identified ideas that were shared and evolved through an elementary school classroom. In mapping these ideas and their resulting changes in programs and outputs, we were able to identify the contextual features which contributed to how ideas moved through the classroom as students learned. We suggest this process of idea mapping in visual programming environments as a viable method for understanding collaborative, constructivist learning as well as a context under which experiences can be developed to improve student learning.

AB  - Over the past ten years several learning environments based on novel interaction modalities have been developed. Within this field, Full-body Interaction Learning Environments open promising possibilities given their capacity to involve the users at different levels, such as sensorimotor experience, cognitive aspects and affective factors. However, Full-body Interaction is still a young field and research on design and assessment methods offers a fragmented panorama from which it is not possible to derive clear research solutions. Starting from this necessity, we present a systematic review of educational applications developed as Full-body Interaction and the results of their empirical evaluation. Our analysis offers instruments to systematize the multiple aspects involved in the design and assessment of Full-body Interaction Learning Environments and provides guidelines for novel research paths.

AB  - Scholars have identified that learning in an authentic environment with quality contextual and procedural supports can engage students in thorough observations and knowledge construction. Moreover, the target is that students are able to experience and make sense of all of the learning activities in the real-world environment with meaningful supports, such that their learning motivation can be promoted, knowledge can be sensibly constructed, and skills can be fully developed. To develop potential tutoring strategies and learning activity models using mobile, wireless, and sensing information and communication technologies (ICT) in a real-world learning environment, a four-year national e-learning research project entitled "Mindtool-Assisted In-field Learning (MAIL)" has been funded by the National Science Council of Taiwan since 2008 in an effort to lead the development and innovation of Learning Technology. The integrated project aimed to develop Mindtool-assisted knowledge construction models, assessment models, guidance models, and reflection strategies for cutting-edge context-aware ubiquitous learning. Moreover, a series of learning activities has been conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed learning strategies and models. Each year, more than 1,500 students have participated in the in-field learning activities with the designed approaches. Based on the results of a series of experiments, it was found that the students' learning performance as well as their in-field inquiry ability was significantly improved, showing the effectiveness of the Mindtool-assisted ubiquitous learning approach and the success of the MAIL project. In this paper, the background, objectives, theoretical foundations, systems, research issues, applications, and findings of the MAIL project are presented. Finally, the scaling-up plan for applying these research-proven learning models to all levels of educational settings in Taiwan is also addressed.

AB  - This article details a study that investigated 55 elementary pre-service teachers' content knowledge about density. Using a mixed-methods approach, pre/post face-to-face interviews and pre/post concepts maps (Cmaps) were used as data to document changes in teacher knowledge which occurred over a 15-week science methods course. Thematic analysis was used to capture patterns within the interview data and a paired-sample t-test was conducted to compare pre/post Cmap scores. Results before instruction indicate a weak framework of prior knowledge about density which was a mosaic of alternative conceptions and a few learned concepts. Many participants focused on a single aspect of density and were unable to engage in relational causality which involves the consideration of two variables simultaneously. After instruction, robust alternative conceptions continued to be observed (e.g., density is buoyancy and density is the same as heaviness, mass, or weight) and learned concepts were concrete and rote. The most common learned concept was the density algorithm (~40%) followed by the learned concept that density is an intensive property of matter (22%) and demonstrated understandings of proportional reasoning (7%). Results of the paired sample t-test demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the total proposition accuracy scores for pre/post Cmaps (t = -3.178, p < 0.002) with the instructional intervention larger for post-Cmap scores (M = 1.02; SD = 1.063) than for pre-Cmap scores (M = 0.55; SD = 0.812). The effect size was medium.

AB  - Research on anxiety in a foreign language-learning context is well-documented; however, few studies have directly focused on anxiety occurring within writing contexts despite the fact that writing anxiety is known to affect students' learning. The present study examined the effectiveness of concept mapping considering students' writing anxiety. Participants completed writing anxiety scales and were randomly assigned to three groups before completing a writing task: concept mapping, idea listing, or an unrelated task. Results indicated that, especially for students with low trait-level writing anxiety, concept mapping positively influenced the quality of writing content. Teaching implications will be discussed in the light of the results of this study.

AB  - The study was conducted to show the effectiveness of concept mapping as a teaching strategy to undergraduate students taking introductory physics course. A number of researchers have investigated the effectiveness of concept mapping on student academic achievement. The main focus of these studies have been on comparing the effectiveness of concept mapping to traditional teaching practices such as the lecture method. This research, however, compared concept mapping to tutorial sheets strategy in teaching circular and rotational motion. A sample of seventy (70) students participated in the experiment. An equivalent number of thirty five (35) students were assigned to the control and experimental group. The control group used tutorial sheets while the experimental group used concept mapping. A pre-test and post-test was administered to the two groups. A t-test was used to compare the means of the group's test scores. The mean score for the experimental group's post test was higher than the mean score of the control group. This showed that concept mapping was more effective than the tutorial sheet strategy. Questionnaires and interviews were also used to determine the attitude of students towards concept mapping. The findings showed that students had a positive attitude towards the use of concept mapping.

AB  - Research has documented the use of tools in computer-based learning environments as problematic, that is, learners do not use the tools and when they do, they tend to do it suboptimally. This study attempts to disentangle cause and effect of this suboptimal tool use for experienced learners. More specifically, learner variables (metacognitive and motivational) were related to the tool presentation (non-/embedded), interventions, type of tool use (quantitatively and qualitative) and learners' performance. One hundred and seventeen graduate students were assigned to one of five conditions (embedded and non-embedded with explained tool functionality, embedded and non-embedded with non-explained tool functionality and one control condition) to study a hypertext using semi-structured concept maps as the tools. Findings are discussed with respect to experienced learners' role on tool use and performance. Although no differences among conditions and performance were found, results reveal that the self-regulation skill of organization and the explained tool functionality affected time on tool negatively, while the self-regulation skill of elaboration and perceived tool usability showed a positive effect. Time on tool influenced performance positively. Quality influenced performance negatively. It is argued that some tools and interventions are unnecessary for experienced learners.

AB  - The importance of entrepreneurship education that positively impact on the creation of new ventures has been widely recognized. Although numerous studies of entrepreneurship education have been conducted within a university setting, the results are mostly fragmented. Therefore, by using a systematic framework, this research is focused on examining relevant learning and institutional supports within a university context for those who want to become successful entrepreneurs. This descriptive study is based on in-depth interviews with respondents at a private university. The gathered data are coded, and they result in a mapping of entrepreneurship education. There are some important findings from this research. One is that the university already has facilities to support learning within the institution, although it lacks in the management to optimize their utilization. The other is that the assurance of the students' learning effectiveness is not well managed.

AB  - This paper reports on teachers' use of concept mapping as an alternative assessment strategy in advanced level biology classes and its effects on students' cognitive skills on selected biology concepts. Using a mixed methods approach, the study employed a pre-test/post-test quasi-experimental design involving 156 students and 8 teachers from intact classes. A researcher-constructed Biology Cognitive Skills Test was used to collect the quantitative data. Qualitative data were collected through interviews and students' personal documents. The data showed that the participants utilized concept mapping in various ways and they described positive experiences while being engaged in its use. The main challenge cited by teachers was the limited time available for more consistent use. The results showed that the use of concept mapping in advanced level biology can lead to learning gains that exceed those achieved in classes where mainly traditional methods are used. The students in the concept mapping experimental groups performed significantly better than their peers in the control group on both the lower-order (F[subscript (1)]?=?21.508; p?<?0.001) and higher-order (F[subscript (1)]?=?42.842, p?< 0.001) cognitive items of the biology test. A mean effect size of 0.56 was calculated representing the contribution of treatment to the students' performance on the test items.

AB  - In this paper I identify the components of "meaningful experiences" for participants on a wilderness river rafting journey. The research is phenomenologically informed, and includes interviews, journals, observations and follow-up emails from 32 participants on eight Franklin River (Tasmania) 10-day trips. It elicits individual perceptions of meaningful experiences and combines recollections to reveal the commonalities within those experiences. The research identifies two key recurrent "streams of experience" that provide meaning. The two recurrent streams of experience involved, firstly, "a feeling of humility" and, secondly, "being alive to the present." In this paper I focus on the stream of experience surrounding a feeling of humility, highlighting the qualities of the ways in which participants interrelated with their surrounding environments and the structure of such experiences. Additionally, I consider some unique elements of the wilderness river journey that contributed to the experiences that participants valued as meaningful.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to use a facet theory research approach to provide a clear, coherent, and integrated model of international students' experiences based upon the findings of psychological research into students when studying abroad. In research that employs a facet theory approach events are classified in terms of their constituent parts or facets and the sub-elements of facets. The specification of facets serves to allow accumulative knowledge and theory construction. A model is proposed in the form of a mapping sentence with three background facets and four content facets. How the mapping sentence forms a flexible template for designing, conducting and analyzing research into international students' experiences is discussed, as is the potential in using facet theory to develop a cumulative body of knowledge about this student group.

AB  - Environmental education in the 21st century requires well-instructed teachers with teaching and communication abilities. This paper presents an educational experience developed in several biology and environmental teacher training courses and focused on the treatment of environmental education as a transversal educational topic. For that aim, text analysis techniques, concept mapping and informatics tools have been used to represent individual and collaborative knowledge about environmental topics. 69 students participated in the research. Data about the educational activities developed by the participants have been collected. Furthermore, students have expressed their opinions on the formative process by means of an opinion survey. The outcomes of this study reveal that future teachers and environmental educators consider that concept mapping is a valuable tool to represent their knowledge about environmental education, to encourage reflexive and collaborative learning, to improve teaching communicative abilities and to use effectively ICT in the classroom.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Argumentation Based Science Teaching on 5th grade students' conceptual understanding of the subjects related to "Matter and Change". This research is a qualitative research and its design is a multiple (compare) case study. In this study, semi-structured interviews related to the concepts were conducted before and after the experimental period in order to assess students' conceptual understanding. The result of the study showed that students who have been trained with argumentation-based science teaching approach showed progress in conceptual understanding. In addition, it has been observed that students were able to explain these concepts with correct warrants and connect them with everyday life. An appendix presents (1) Introduction Activity (Turkish Version); (2) Introduction Activity (English Version); and (3) Turkish and English versions of 7 worksheets.

AB  - In view of the perceived difficulty of organic chemistry unit for high schools students, this study examined the usefulness of concept mapping as a testing device to assess students' difficulty in the select areas. Since many tests used for identifying students misconceptions and difficulties in school subjects are observed to favour one or the other gender, this study examined efficacy of concept mapping as a gender fair test to appraise student difficulty in organic chemistry unit for high schools. Concept mapping is plotted against multiple-choice-item test, which is the commonly used objective test item format, and the true-false item test, which is advocated as efficient in finding out students misconceptions, to compare the usefulness of the first against the second and third in assessing student difficulties within organic chemistry in gender fair manner. The sample consisted of 117 tenth standard students from a rural government school in Kozhikode, Kerala. The test administration employed a counter-balanced design. This ensured that while all the students in the sample responded to all the three tests, one third of the study sample each answered the three tests first, second and third respectively. The first and second tests were considered pilot testing, such that the variation in score from the third test indicated the misconceptions than mere memory or guessing. The student performance, by gender, on the three test forms were compared using two-way ANOVA. The result indicated that concept mapping is at par with the true-false item format, in assessing student difficulties in organic chemistry in a gender fair manner, while the multiple choice item test scores favour girls, as is the customary case with the achievement scores in schools in Kerala. The findings highlight the need for developing improved formative test formats that could be used in accordance with fairer and inclusive schooling practices. (Contains 5 Tables and 1 Figure.)

AB  - One critical aspect that hinders the systematic use of concept mapping in everyday classrooms is the difficulty of providing high-quality feedback to students so as to keep improving and revising their concept maps (Cmaps). The development of an innovative way to analyse, at a glance, students' Cmaps is presented to allow a diagnostic assessment of student conceptual learning. This paper proposes Neighbourhood Analysis (NeAn) as an innovative way to foster meaningful learning through the identification of Limited or Inappropriate Propositional Hierarchies (LIPHs) in Cmaps. The instructional strategy that underlies NeAn involves the selection of a compulsory concept (CC), which must be a threshold concept addressing the Cmap's focal question. The goal is to estimate students' understanding of the subject, in order to detect the presence (or absence) of LIPHs. We analysed 69 Cmaps from a higher education setting and found that 175 propositions were related to the CC. This subset of all propositions was enough for instructors to provide specific high-quality feedback to their students, even under normal teaching conditions. NeAn is a straightforward way to identify LIPHs allowing instructors to make diagnostic assessments of students' conceptual outcomes during the learning process, and to track the effects of their instructional options. NeAn can be meaningfully applied for assessing science students at secondary level and above, with special potential applicability across science subjects.

AB  - Some task analysis methods break down a task into a hierarchy of subgoals. Although an important tool of many fields of study, learning to create such a hierarchy (redescription) is not trivial. To further the understanding of what makes task analysis a skill, the present research examined novices' problems with learning Hierarchical Task Analysis and captured practitioners' performance. All participants received a task description and analyzed three cooking and three communication tasks by drawing on their knowledge of those tasks. Thirty six younger adults (18-28 years) in Study 1 analyzed one task before training and five afterwards. Training consisted of a general handout that all participants received and an additional handout that differed between three conditions: a list of steps, a flow-diagram, and concept map. In Study 2, eight experienced task analysts received the same task descriptions as in Study 1 and demonstrated their understanding of task analysis while thinking aloud. Novices' initial task analysis scored low on all coding criteria. Performance improved on some criteria but was well below 100% on others. Practitioners' task analyses were 2-3 levels deep but also scored low on some criteria. A task analyst's purpose of analysis may be the reason for higher specificity of analysis. This research furthers the understanding of Hierarchical Task Analysis and provides insights into the varying nature of task analyses as a function of experience. The derived skill components can inform training objectives.

AB  - The paper details an exploratory qualitative study that investigated 61 prospective teachers' conceptual understanding of dissolving salt and sugar in water respectively. The study was set within a 15-week elementary science methods course that included a 5E learning cycle lesson on dissolving, the instructional context. Oversby's ("Prim Sci Rev" 63:6-19, 2002, "Aspects of Teaching Secondary Science," Routledge Falmer, London, 2002) ladder of explanations for the context of dissolving, current scientific explanations for dissolving and perspectives on conceptions and misconceptions provided the unified framework for the study. Concept maps, interview transcripts, written artifacts, and drawings and narratives were used as data to investigate these prospective teachers' conceptual understanding of dissolving throughout the 15-weeks of the methods course. Analysis revealed that participants' explanations of dissolving were predominantly descriptive explanations (39%) and interpretative explanations (38%), with lower percentage occurrences of intentional (14%) and cause and effect (9%) level explanations. Most of these explanations were also constructed by a set of loosely connected and reinforcing everyday concepts abstracted from common everyday experiences making them misconceptions. Implications include: (1) the need for science teacher educators to use multiple platforms to derive their prospective elementary teachers' conceptual understandings of science content; and (2) to identify and help them identify their own scientific conceptions and misconceptions and how they influence the construction of scientific/nonscientific explanations. Science teacher educators also need to emphasize the role of meaningful frameworks associated with the concept that is being introduced during the Engage phase of the 5E learning cycle. This is important because, relevant prior knowledge is associated with the knowledge of the particle theory of matter and both are part of larger knowledge system comprised of interrelated scientific concepts.

AB  - The use of concept mapping as a tool to measure the meaningful learning of students is the focus of this study. The study was carried out with 24 last year students (22 years old) from the Department of Chemistry Teaching at Fatih Faculty of Education, Karadeniz Technical University (KTU). Prospective Chemistry Teachers (PCT) were asked to create concept maps using a list of given concepts related to gases. An examination of the PCTs' maps revealed that the students could not form hierarchical maps even after being shown examples of the basic elements and meaningful propositions between the concepts. After being provided with feedback about their concept maps and trained to form non-hierarchical concept maps, the students were asked to create new maps. This time they were allowed to use either hierarchical or non-hierarchical maps. When their new maps were examined, we found that most of the PCTs formed non-hierarchical maps. However, they still could not form meaningful relationships between the given concepts. We also found that the PCTs had some misconceptions about gases and kinetic molecular theory that explains gas behavior. The study ended up with some suggestions and implications for educators and researchers related to pre-service teachers' training.

AB  - Ausubel and Novak's construct of "meaningful learning" stipulates that substantive connections between new knowledge and what is already known requires the integration of thinking, feeling, and performance (Novak J. D., (2010), "Learning, creating, and using knowledge: concept maps as facilitative tools in schools and corporations," New York, NY: Routledge Taylor & Francis Group.). This study explores the integration of these three domains using a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. A tripartite model was developed to examine meaningful learning through the correlational relationships among thinking, feeling, and performance using student responses regarding Intellectual Accessibility and Emotional Satisfaction on the Attitudes toward the Subject of Chemistry Inventory version 2 (ASCI V2) and performance on the American Chemical Society exam. We compared the primary model to seven alternatives in which correlations were systematically removed in order to represent a lack of interconnectedness among the three domains. The tripartite model had the strongest statistical fit, thereby providing statistical evidence for the construct of meaningful learning. Methodological issues associated with SEM techniques, including problems related to non-normal multivariate distributions (an assumption of traditional SEM techniques), and causal relationships are considered. Additional findings include evidence for weak configural invariance in the pre/post implementation of the ASCI(V2), mainly due to the poor structure of the pretest data. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for teaching and learning.

AB  - Climate change is a complex environmental problem that can be used to examine students' understanding, gained through classroom communication, of climate change and its interactions. The present study examines a series of four science sessions given to a group of primary school student teachers (n?=?20). This includes analysis of the communication styles used and the students' pre- and post-conceptualisation of climate change based on results obtained via essay writing and drawings. The essays and drawings concerned the students' unprompted pre- and post-conceptions about climate change, collected before and after each of the four inquiry-based science sessions (in physics, chemistry, biology and geography). Concept mapping was used in the analysis of the students' responses. The communication used in the four sessions was analysed with a communicative approach in order to find out the discussion about climate change between teacher and students. The analyses indicated that the students did not have the knowledge or the courage to participate in discussion, but post-conceptualisation map showed that students' thinking had become more coherent after the four sessions. Given the results of the present study, proposals for using concepts maps and/or communication analysis in studying students' conceptions are presented.

AB  - Research in contemporary biology has become increasingly complex and organized around understanding biological processes in the context of systems. To better reflect the ways of thinking required for learning about systems, we developed and implemented a pedagogical approach using box-and-arrow models (similar to concept maps) as a foundational tool for instruction and assessment in an Introductory Biology course on genetics, evolution, and ecology. Over the course of one semester, students iteratively constructed, evaluated, and revised "Gene-to-Evolution" (GtE) models intended to promote understanding about the connections linking molecular-level processes with population-level outcomes. In practice, a successful GtE model contextualizes information provided in a case study and explains how genetic-level variation originates at the molecular level, is differentially expressed among individuals, and is acted upon by the environment to produce evolutionary change within a population. Our analyses revealed that students' ability to construct biologically accurate models increased throughout the semester. Model complexity peaked near mid-term then subsequently declined. This suggests that, with time, students were building more parsimonious models, shedding irrelevant information, and improving in their ability to apply accurate and appropriate biological language to explain relationships among concepts. Importantly, we observed the greatest relative gains in model correctness among students who entered the course with lower mean GPA. In an analysis comparing performance among achievement tritiles, lower-performing students effectively closed the achievement gap with the highest performing students by the end of the semester. Our findings support the effectiveness of model-based pedagogies for science teaching and learning, and offer a perspective on pedagogical application of modeling strategies to foster systems thinking and knowledge structuring in college-level biology.

AB  - This study sought to identify ethnically diverse students' study strategies in organic chemistry and their relationships to course outcomes. Study diaries, concept maps, and problem sets were used to assess study outcomes. Findings show that students engage in four commonly used reviewing-type strategies, regardless of ethnic group affiliation. However, these common strategies were rarely associated with students' problem solving, concept mapping, or course performance. In addition, students seldom engaged in metacognitive and peer learning strategies despite their reported benefits in the literature. Implications for research and practice are discussed in light of these findings. (Contains 2 tables, 1 figure, and 2 notes.)

AB  - The challenge of teaching new subject matter is a familiar one for most teachers. This paper investigates the content knowledge gains made by seven teachers as they learn to teach the topic of semiconductors through a process of self-study. "Semiconductors" is a new topic in the curriculum which looks at the sub-microscopic properties of materials used in electronics and is important because of its applications in modern technology. We present a phenomenographic analysis of 21 concept maps produced by seven teachers at various stages of their self-study project. Four categories of description emerged in the analysis, viz. no meaning, orientation to understanding of subject matter (SMK), a pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) context focus, and a PCK strategy focus. The last category proved to be the most interesting as it suggested that the teacher saw the learning of SMK and learning to teach the SMK as a single process. This finding was considered as important in understanding how teachers learn new SMK for teaching. We found that experienced teachers make sense of their new SMK in different ways. There is a variation of orientation in their learning and sense-making. The data also showed progression of teachers' understanding of the topic through the self-study process. The findings suggest that learning SMK for the purposes of teaching is different to learning for fulfilling the requirements of a study programme.

AB  - Educational research maintains that, teaching science through designing technology has significant educational potential. Although the literature emphasizes that making technological designs is beneficial for students, it is stressed that studies about technological design generally focus on mental structures rather than hand skills of students and learning by doing and experience. In this study, we tried to determine the effect of a "Model Parachute Race" activity on elementary student teachers' levels of understanding of concepts such as air resistance, gravity, terminal velocity  and acceleration using a qualitative methodology. In this context, elementary student teachers' levels of understanding of concepts were determined before and after the activity, and change was revealed through analyzing the difference between them. It was found that elementary student teachers learnt science concepts better during technological design process than during traditional science lessons. In addition, it is thought that if a technological design process is supported with theoretical information, desired change will occur in levels of understanding the science concepts.

AB  - The concept map tool set forth by Novak and colleagues is underutilized in education. A meta-analysis has encouraged teachers to make extensive use of concept mapping, and researchers have advocated computer-based concept mapping applications that exploit hyperlink technology. Through an NSF sponsored geosciences education grant, middle and secondary science teachers participated in professional development to apply computer-based concept mapping in project-based learning (PBL) units that investigated local watersheds. Participants attended a summer institute, engaged in a summer through spring online learning academy, and presented PBL units at a subsequent fall science teachers' convention. The majority of 17 teachers who attended the summer institute had previously used the concept mapping strategy with students and rated it highly. Of the 12 teachers who continued beyond summer, applications of concept mapping ranged from collaborative planning of PBL projects to building students' vocabulary to students producing maps related to the PBL driving question. Barriers to the adoption and use of concept mapping included technology access at the schools, lack of time for teachers to advance their technology skills, lack of student motivation to choose to learn, and student difficulty with linking terms. In addition to mitigating the aforementioned barriers, projects targeting teachers' use of technology tools may enhance adoption by recruiting teachers as partners from schools as well as a small number that already are proficient in the targeted technology and emphasizing the utility of the concept map as a planning tool.

AB  - Two studies were conducted to examine content knowledge changes following 2 weeks of professional development that included scientific research with university scientists. Engaging teachers in scientific research is considered to be an effective way of encouraging knowledge of both inquiry pedagogy and content knowledge. We used concept maps with two cohorts of teachers to assess changes in science teacher knowledge. In study 1, 34 teachers developed pre- and post-concept maps in one of the nine different content areas. A repeated measures analysis of six quantitative scores showed statistically significant increases in knowledge representation. Quantitative and qualitative scoring methods indicate that concept maps are effective for assessing teacher knowledge gains from professional development. Study 2 replicated the results with 24 teachers and provided further information about how knowledge changes.

AB  - Good conceptual understanding of physics is based on understanding what the key concepts are and how they are related. This kind of understanding is especially important for physics teachers in planning how and in what order to introduce concepts in teaching; connections which tie concepts to each other give direction of progress--there is "flux of information" so that what was learned before provides the basis for learning new ideas. In this study, we discuss how such ordering of concepts can be made visible by using concept maps and how they can be used in analysing the students' views and ideas about the inherent logic of the teaching plans. The approach discussed here is informed by the recent cognitively oriented ideas of knowledge organisation concentrating on simple knowledge organisation patterns and how they form the basis of more complex concept networks. The analysis of such "concept networks" is then very naturally based on the use of network theory on analysing the concept maps. The results show that even in well-connected maps, there can be abrupt changes in the information flux in the way knowledge is passed from the initial levels to the final levels. This suggests that handling the information content is very demanding and perhaps a very difficult skill for a pre-service teacher to master.

AB  - Apps, specialized programs used on mobile computers, can be used in innovative ways to enhance science and literacy learning. With the skilled guidance of their teachers, students can exploit app affordances for learning and acquire disciplinary literacies unique to science. This article showcases apps that help students to access information, make sense of it, and create their own products that include rich visual representations. We also describe teaching approaches that support the close reading of science texts through the use of note-taking and annotation apps. Classroom examples that are featured illustrate that these app affordances are not simply in the apps, but rather, fostered by how the teachers exploit these affordances to achieve their own particular learning objectives. As we become more familiar with new apps as educational tools, we need to be mindful about how these tools strategically in ways that best enhance our students' own learning.

AB  - A study was conducted to quantify the effectiveness of concept maps in learning physics in engineering degrees. The following research question was posed: What was the difference in learning results from the use of concept maps to study a particular topic in an engineering course? The study design was quasi-experimental and used a post-test as a measuring instrument. The sample included 114 university students from the School of Industrial Engineering who were divided into two equivalent homogeneous groups of 57 students each. The amount of learning attained by the students in each group was compared, with the independent variable being the teaching method; the experimental group (E.G.) used concept maps, while the control group (C.G.) did not. We performed a crossover study with the two groups of students, with one group acting as the E.G. for the topic of optical fibers and as the C.G. for the topic of the fundamental particles of matter and vice versa for the other group. For each of the two topics studied, the evaluation instrument was a test of 100 dichotomous items. The resulting data were subjected to a comparative statistical analysis, which revealed a significant difference in the amount of learning attained by the E.G. students as compared with the C.G. students. The results allow us to state that for the use of concept maps, the average increment in the E.G. students' learning was greater than 19 percentage points.

AB  - This article highlights how English language learners' (ELLs) prior knowledge can be used to help learn science vocabulary. The article explains that the concept of prior knowledge needs to encompass the ELL student's native language, previous science learning, native literacy skills, and native cultural knowledge and life experiences. Information is provided on how science teachers can use ELL's native languages, culturally familiar experiences, and concept mapping to assist in comprehension. A biome concept map and rubric are presented to help explain ways to better teach ELLs.

AB  - As student teachers, authors Emily Clark, Laura Hornsby, Abigail Howard, and Kathryn Pople were aware of what the class had already covered on World War 2 (WW2). It was unclear to them, however, what knowledge the children actually had acquired from the lessons. In this article these student teachers describe their use of concept mapping as they developed a sequence of lessons to explore WW2, food, and nutrition. Besides having a thoroughly enjoyable time, the student teachers learned several useful things that will help influence and improve their own future practice. For example, using children's ideas to influence thinking and lesson planning gives them ownership over their work, and is motivational and stimulating. The authors write that they noticed the quality of work produced by the students appeared to be better for having made use of that particular technique. From a trainee teacher's point of view, developing subject knowledge can be a daunting and tedious task, however, doing it with the help of children made a refreshing and inspiring change. The student teachers discovered that the children often highlighted questions that they had not thought about, for example where should eggs be placed within the nutrition exercise--dairy or protein?

AB  - In physics teacher education, one of the recurrent themes is the importance of fostering the formation of organised and coherent knowledge structures, but a simple shared understanding of what coherence actually means and how it can be recognised, is not easily found. This study suggests an approach in which the coherence of students' views about the relatedness of physics concepts can be identified and evaluated. Six pre-service physics teachers presented their understanding of the relatedness of physics concepts in the form of specially designed concept maps in which experimental or modelling procedures were required as links between physics concepts. The acceptability of the links was evaluated by using four criteria for epistemic analysis introduced in this study. The weighted values describing the maps' structural features were calculated, and finally, the cases were compared and the differences between them were discussed. The results show that the epistemic analysis of links affects remarkably to the acceptability of knowledge and thus also the coherence of such knowledge. The highest criterion set for acceptability seems to be very demanding to fulfil and even in the advanced level of studies only a fraction of students manage to reach it. The cases examined here show that the knowledge structures are partly fragmented and not as coherent as one would have expected them to be.

AB  - Betty's Brain is an open-ended learning environment in which students learn about science topics by teaching a virtual agent named Betty through the construction of a visual causal map that represents the relevant science phenomena. The task is complex, and success requires the use of metacognitive strategies that support knowledge acquisition, causal map construction, and progress monitoring. Previous research has established that middle school students struggle at such tasks without proper scaffolding and feedback. In Betty's Brain, this feedback is provided by Betty and Mr. Davis, another virtual agent designed to provide guidance and suggestions as students work. This paper discusses our implementation of contextualized conversational (CC) feedback, and then presents the results of an experimental study exploring the effects of this feedback in two 8th-grade science classrooms. The results illustrate some advantages of the CC feedback in comparison with a baseline dialogue mechanism that presents similar strategies in a non-conversational, non-contextualized form. While both groups showed significant pre-to-post test learning gains, the difference in learning gains between the groups was not statistically significant. However, students who received CC feedback more often performed actions in accordance with the advised strategies, and they created higher quality causal maps.

AB  - The Earth sciences are newly marginalized in K-12 classrooms. With few high schools offering Earth science courses, students' exposure to the Earth sciences relies on the teacher's ability to incorporate Earth science material into a biology, chemistry, or physics course. ''G.E.T. (Geoscience Experiences for Teachers) in the Field'' is an exploratory program funded by the National Science Foundation aimed to increase teachers' geoscience interest and content knowledge. Participant teachers (n = 7) included non-Earth science teachers from underrepresented groups and/or high schools with a high percentage of students from underrepresented groups. A variety of quantitative and qualitative measures assessed changes in teachers' readiness and propensity for incorporating geoscience concepts into their current curricula. Findings are compelling, though these results are based on a small sample of teachers. In light of current politics, where Earth science is largely disregarded, professional development workshops like this one can help science teachers become knowledgeable enough to incorporate and expand on geosciences connections in biology, chemistry, and physics.

AB  - We propose an expanded definition of Threshold Concepts (TCs) that requires the successful acquisition and internalisation not only of knowledge, but also its practical elaboration in the domains of applied strategies and mental models. This richer definition allows us to clarify the relationship between TCs and Fundamental Ideas, and to account for both the important and the problematic characteristics of TCs in terms of the Knowledge/Strategies/Mental Models Framework defined in previous work.

AB  - This article critically reviews the extant literature on scientific creativity and metaphorical thinking. Metaphorical thinking is based on a conceptual transfer of relationships or mapping, from a well-known source domain to a poorly known target domain, which could result in creative outcomes in sciences. Creativity leads to products that are deemed to be novel and original as well as useful and adaptive. After reviewing the concepts of metaphor and analogy and the types of metaphor identified in the literature, the relationships traditionally theorized between metaphors and creativity from different scientific disciplines were discussed, with special focus on the psychology of creativity. The empirical study of the links between creativity and metaphors can contribute to a better understanding of the scientific process. Promising lines for future research are advanced, such as the exploration of the relationship between the presence of certain types of metaphors in scientific theories and the level of creativity of such theories.

AB  - Residential environmental education centers are important providers of science curriculum, offering students learning experiences outside the traditional classroom. One major criticism of these centers and other nonformal science centers is that they often do not include student outcomes in the evaluation of their programs. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of the use of concept maps as a means of documenting changes in student knowledge in order to include students in the program evaluations of residential environmental education centers. In this mixed-method study, 3rd and 6th grade elementary students created concept maps before and after a field trip to a residential environmental education center. Analyses of the maps revealed a significant increase in the number of unique ideas represented on the posttest maps. Interviews with stakeholders revealed that the maps provided center stakeholders with valuable information regarding program impact. Results of the study suggest that concept maps can be used effectively to document changes in student knowledge and may contribute to improvement in program evaluations of residential environmental education centers.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the achievement of students taught with concept mapping, cooperative learning, 5E learning cycle and lecture methods with the intention of identifying which one among them could be most suitable for teaching Biology. To guide this study, four research questions were raised and tested at 0.05 level of significance. The design of the study was pre-test, post-test, delayed post-test, quasi experimental repeated measures design. The samples of the study consisted of four mixed secondary schools, 259 students and eight Biology teachers. The major findings of the study include: significant effect of the four instructional methods on achievement and retention; students in the 5E learning cycle and cooperative leaning groups significantly outscored those in the concept mapping and lecture groups on achievement and retention tests; students in concept mapping outscored those in lecture group both on immediate achievement and retention tests; students in 5E learning cycle and cooperative learning groups did not significantly differ on achievement and retention tests; males and females in all the four groups did not significantly differ on the achievement tests; and a non-significant interaction effect between sex and method of instruction on achievement. It was concluded that the adoption of either 5E learning cycle or cooperative learning strategies may be appropriate for the teaching and learning of Biology.

AB  - Idioms have long been regarded as problematic for L2 learners due to the arbitrariness of their meanings and forms. Traditional methods of teaching idioms focus on rote learning and memorization. Recent developments in cognitive linguistics research have considered idioms as analyzable expressions which are motivated by conceptual metaphors and whose meanings can derive from associations between source and target concepts. Believed to be imageable and comprehensive, idioms should be learned through the process of raising L2 learners' awareness of conceptual metaphors behind these expressions. Nevertheless, these methods fail to notice culture entailments embedded in conceptual metaphors. Especially for FL learners who share neither common cultural background nor living environment with the target language users, difficulties resulting from transferability between L1 and L2 idioms owing to cultural similarities and differences may be serious. To bridge the gap between idioms and conceptual metaphors caused by cross-cultural differences, this study suggests a teaching method by incorporating the idea of metaphoric mappings. A case study was conducted in an EFL writing class to investigate the effect of the methods. Essays written by the students before and after the instruction were analyzed. Results showed that the students increased frequencies of using not only common idiomatic expressions but also creative analogies comprising vivid images based on the conceptual metaphors taught. Additionally, they used L2 expressions whose conceptual metaphors also existed in L1 more often then expressions whose conceptual metaphors were exclusive in L2. Such findings affirm the importance of culture and provide valuable insight to EFL teachers in adopting cognitive-oriented method to teach English idioms.

AB  - One of the main components of teachers' pedagogical content knowledge refers to their use of representation forms. In a similar vein, organizing concepts logically and meaningfully is an essential element of teachers' subject matter knowledge. Since subject matter and pedagogical content knowledge of teachers are tightly connected as categories forming their knowledge base, it is reasonable to expect that representation forms and organization of knowledge are related. In order to find out how far these two facets depend on each other, two Finnish upper secondary physics teachers' answers to an electronic questionnaire were analysed as case studies. Questions varied from teachers' organization of knowledge to their representation forms regarding the topics of "magnetic flux density" and "Ampère's law." A concept map constructed by one teacher, led us to an improved description of teachers' knowledge organization. In addition, observed and analysed lessons given by the second teacher shed light on representation forms. Organization of knowledge of the studied topics was investigated by means of recognizing the core concepts, and then interrelations between the other concepts. So, the study could advise physics teacher to more systematically plan and organize their teaching of the studied topics. Other findings illuminate useful representation forms that physics teachers apply during their teaching such as suiting experiments, explanations, and models. Thus, our conceptualization emphasize for teachers to reflect on effective ways to organize their knowledge and, consequently, to select adequate representation forms.

AB  - In Larry Clark's monograph chapter on the education of academically talented college students, he challenged honors educators to consider their role in helping students find their path, particularly through the addition of self-reflection and exploratory projects in honors courses. In an honors first-year experience (FYE) course for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) majors at the University of Florida, one assignment was designed in particular to meet the special needs of honors students and to achieve Larry Clark's goals. This article serves as an illustration and model of "helping students find their path" through Melissa Johnson's perspective as an instructor, and through the comments of two first-year students--Stephanie Podjed and Sean Taasan--who took an honors FYE course for STEM majors at the University of Florida. The honors FYE course for STEM majors is taught by an honors advisor with the assistance of two honors student leaders who are also STEM majors. This elective course introduces students to opportunities in the STEM fields that include research with faculty, internships, and global engagement while at the same time building skills in areas such as networking, interviewing, and résumé development. This one-credit course meets once a week for an hour, but also includes a hybrid component where students complete online modules to prepare them for each week's class. The online modules provide a series of guides where students reflect on the previous week's topic, review background material for the next week's topic, and search for and discuss opportunities relevant to their interests.

AB  - This paper presents a framework for the evaluation of concept maps. We focus on supporting the student in dealing with ill-structured and complex problems. We argue that these problems require the application of "the modularity approach." In view of this, the paper describes ways of providing student support for the implementation of this approach within the context of a concept mapping activity. As a basis we make use findings from the field of brain science and mathematical concepts and tools from the field of network theory, in order to present specific evaluation methods, the further development of which we consider extremely promising.

AB  - These proceedings contain the papers of the IADIS International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in the Digital Age (CELDA 2013), October 22-24, 2013, which has been organized by the International Association for Development of the Information Society (IADIS), co-organized by The University of North Texas (UNT), sponsored by the Association for Educational Communication and Technologies (AECT), and endorsed by the Japanese Society for Information and Systems in Education (JSISE). The CELDA 2013 conference aims to address the main issues concerned with evolving learning processes and supporting pedagogies and applications in the digital age. There have been advances in both cognitive psychology and computing that have affected the educational arena. The convergence of these two disciplines is increasing at a fast pace and affecting academia and professional practice in many ways. Paradigms such as just-in-time learning, constructivism, student-centered learning, and collaborative approaches have emerged and are being supported by technological advancements such as simulations, virtual reality, and multi-agents systems. These developments have created both opportunities and areas of serious concerns. This conference aims to cover both technological as well as pedagogical issues related to these developments. However, innovative contributions that do not easily fit into these areas are also included as long as they are directly related to the overall theme of the conference--cognition and exploratory learning in the digital age. The conference included the Keynote Lecture: "Ubiquitous Learning Analytics for Adaptive and Authentic Instruction," by Professor Kinshuk, Associate Dean of Faculty of Science and Technology, NSERC/iCORE/Xerox/Markin Industrial Research Chair--School of Computing and Information Systems, Athabasca University, Canada.

AB  - Children's challenging behaviors can be addressed with effective interventions that can meet children's emotional needs and support their families. Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) value the family involvement in the process of their child treatment. The intention of this study was to use concept mapping as an adjunct to PBIS in an ecological setting. Participants were a four years old boy diagnosed with ADHD and his mother. A multiple-probe baseline across family routines design was used to evaluate the usefulness of concept mapping as an adjunct to the PBIS process (independent variable) on the level of task-engagement behaviors, challenging behaviors, and parent fidelity of implementation (dependent variables) across three routines. Results recognized concept mapping as a promising practice in parent education.

AB  - In this study, we investigated whether concept maps were used as often and as effectively in elementary science and technology classrooms as recommended by the National Ministry of Education (MEB) in the new curricula in Turkey. In the new elementary science and technology curricula, the MEB provides a general concept map for each unit. We used concept maps provided for the Light and Sound units for fourth, fifth, and sixth grades as content to determine whether students were able to use concept maps to gather information from them. Our analyses showed that most of the students did not use the concept maps to answer the questions. Rather they used their own knowledge and cognitive structures about light and sound to answer the questions. Therefore, we concluded that students do not know how to read the concept maps and gather knowledge from them. Also, we ran an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test to explore whether grade level has an effect on students' performance in reading the concept maps and gathering information from them. We found that grade level has a significant effect on students' performance in using concept maps.

AB  - We study the misconceptions about colour that most people hold, determining the general phenomenological laws that govern them. Concept mapping was used to combat the misconceptions which were found in the application of a test specifically designed to determine these misconceptions, while avoiding the possible misleading inductions that could have arisen from the use of everyday language. In particular, care was taken to avoid the distorting effect that the use of the verb "to be" applied to coloured objects could have on the responses. The misconceptions found were shown to have an internal consistency in the form of authentic mini-theories (implicit theories). We compared experimentally the results of two different teaching methods applied to combat these misconceptions. This study was conducted with 470 undergraduates of the University of Extremadura. We analysed the persistence over time of their learning made to overcome those misconceptions. The students were divided randomly into an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). To combat their misconceptions, EG were taught following a method based on the use of concept maps, and CG were taught following traditional teaching methods. The results of a pre-test and a post-test were compared for the two groups, finding statistically significant differences. The results allowed the principal working hypothesis to be accepted--concept maps are learning tools which foster conceptual change and allow misconceptions to be eradicated via meaningful learning maintained over time, i.e. EG acquired a relative long-lasting gain in learning that was superior to that acquired by CG.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to use a comparative approach to scrutinize the common assumption that certain school science activities are theoretical and therefore particularly suited for engaging students with scientific ideas, whereas others are practical and, thus, not equally conducive to engagement with scientific ideas. We compared two school science activities, one (laboratory work) that is commonly regarded as focusing attention on artefacts that may distract students from central science concepts and the other (concept mapping) that is thought to make students focus directly on these concepts. We observed students in either a laboratory activity about real galvanic cells or a concept-mapping activity about idealized galvanic cells. We used a practical epistemology analysis to compare the two activities regarding students' actions towards scientific ideas and artefacts. The comparison revealed that the two activities, despite their alleged differences along the theory-practice scale, primarily resulted in similar student actions. For instance, in both activities, students interacted extensively with artefacts and, to a lesser extent, with scientific ideas. However, only occasionally did students establish any explicit continuity between artefacts and scientific ideas. The findings indicate that some of the problems commonly considered to be unique for school science practical work may indeed be a feature of school science activities more generally.

AB  - The study aims to investigate the effects of using mind maps and concept maps on students' learning of concepts in science courses. A total of 51 students participated in this study which used a quasi-experimental research design with pre-test/post-test control groups. The constructivist-inspired study was carried out in the sixth-grade science course unit of "Light and Sound" in a primary school with two experimental groups and one control group. The intervention was held in the experimental group 1 by using technology-assisted technique of mind mapping, in the experimental group 2 by using technology-assisted technique of concept mapping, and in the control group by means of traditional classroom instruction. After the intervention in the experimental groups, concept tests and open-ended questions related to the unit were used as post-tests. According to the data obtained from concept tests, it was found out that all groups' understanding of concepts was equivalent. Significantly, students in the experimental group 2 reported positive opinions, stating that learning through concept maps was useful and engaging.

AB  - To understand genetics, students need to be able to explain and draw connections between a large number of concepts. The purpose of the study reported herein was to explore the way upper secondary science students reason about concepts in molecular genetics in order to understand protein synthesis. Data were collected by group interviews. Concept maps were constructed using the interview transcripts, and analysed. The most central concept was DNA, which served as a link between the concepts of genes and proteins. Students spontaneously introduced concepts from "classical genetics" to explain "molecular genetics." The concept maps generated from the different group interviews were similar in that various concepts consistently appeared within specific sub-groups of interconnected concepts, ie clusters. Five main clusters were identified. The students were better able to relate between concepts within a cluster than between concepts in different clusters. The clusters can be seen as representations of the students' knowledge structures, and could be used as starting points in teaching genetics. We recommend that courses in genetics should begin by focusing on students' existing connections between concepts from different clusters and then point out concepts that feature in two or more clusters such as "DNA," "gene," and "protein."

AB  - A large body of research in the learning sciences has focused on students' commonsense science knowledge--the everyday knowledge of the natural world that is gained outside of formal instruction. Although researchers studying commonsense science have employed a variety of methods, 1-on-1 clinical interviews have played a unique role. The data that result from these interviews take the form of video recordings, which in turn are often compiled into written transcripts and coded by human analysts. In this article, I explore the application of computational techniques to the analysis of this familiar type of data. I describe the success I have had using extremely simple methods from computational linguistics--methods that are based on rudimentary vector space models and simple clustering algorithms. These automated analyses are employed in an exploratory mode as a way to discover student conceptions in the data. The aims of this article are primarily methodological in nature: I attempt to show that it is possible to use techniques from computational linguistics to analyze data from commonsense science interviews in a manner that may provide convergent support for the work of human analysts. As a test bed, I draw on transcripts of a corpus of interviews in which 54 middle school students were asked to explain the seasons.

AB  - Students hold many misconceptions in school science. Research reveals that teachers themselves, at times, are one source of misconceptions among students. A good number of such misconceptions, carried on to the next generation via school, are held by teachers; from their own school days and kept uncorrected even after their teacher education course. Teacher educators observe that student teachers show "inadequate" "insufficient" "marked deficiency" in the content knowledge. Despite this, there is no room in the present elementary teacher education curriculum for enhancing their content knowledge. The only way to impart content knowledge--pedagogic analysis--is a "ritual" in almost all institutions. Therefore, student teachers must get a chance for brushing up science concepts they ought to teach. Concept mapping is a strategy that can be used to impart content knowledge with sense within a limited span of time.

AB  - The universities and faculties which educate teachers of mathematics for teaching  pupils/students of any age group from pre-school age to higher education carefully  monitor and compare valuable results of this research, detect the areas in which the mathematical achievements of pupils should be improved at the national level and propose the ways to improve the quality of education and achieve better learning outcomes. We deem particularly valuable contributions of the researchers regarding the samples of poorer mathematical achievements at the "local level" in neighbouring countries, as well as the presentation of examples of good practice by  means of which we pave the path towards better achievements of pupils and, consequently, the improvement in the quality of teaching mathematics at the "local," as well as the global level. This book contains the results of the research on teaching mathematics and examples of good practice provided by the scholars from the neighbouring countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Hungary, Germany, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Mathematics teachers and parents can use this book to find answers to specific questions connected to the understanding of contemporary trends and procedures in teaching mathematics in our surroundings. In this manner we are contributing to the global efforts to improve the quality of teaching mathematics. Thus, we are also affecting better learning outcomes in the area of mathematics, and consequently upward moving trends in economy.

AB  - Following the trend in science and engineering education generated by the visible impact created by the Force Concept Inventory (FCI), the investigator developed a Physics of Semiconductors Concept Inventory (PSCI). PSCI fills the need of standardized concept tests for undergraduate education in photonics and electrical engineering. The structure of the PSCI test followed a concept map reflecting the input from a panel of experts from different universities and from a survey of textbooks currently used in engineering schools in the United States. Based on the statistical analysis of the scores and response patterns, the test was calibrated as an instrument to measure participants' cognitive ability independent of items' difficulty. The models employed were the Rasch Model and the Rasch Partial Credit Model. The estimation procedure employed was Conditional Maximum Likelihood. The analysis was carried on using algorithms written in the open-source language R. The current PSCI BETA test contains eighteen calibrated items covering six concepts of the physics of semiconductors. PSCI BETA may be used for three purposes: individual student diagnostic if applied at the beginning of a physics of semiconductors course; predictor for students' academic performance in the field of semiconductors if applied at the end of instruction; assessment instrument for instructional strategies if applied both for pre- and post-instruction. The PSCI BETA instrument can be applied in any English speaking college setting. The main results of the PSCI research are: ranking persons' ability related to the physics of semiconductors on an objective linear scale, building a diagnose matrix that may be utilized by instructors for choosing an optimal teaching approach and by students for remediation, and demonstrating a calibration method for small sample size.

AB  - This dissertation explored beliefs about learning from multiple related visual representations in science, and compared beliefs to learning outcomes. Three research questions were explored: 1) What beliefs do pre-service teachers, non-educators and children have about learning from visual representations? 2) What format of presenting those representations is most effective for learning? And, 3) Can children's ability to process conceptually related science diagrams be enhanced with added support? Three groups of participants, 89 pre-service teachers, 211 adult non-educators, and 385 middle school children, were surveyed about whether they felt related visual representations presented serially or simultaneously would lead to better learning outcomes. Two experiments, one with adults and one with child participants, explored the validity of these beliefs. Pre-service teachers did not endorse either serial or simultaneous related visual representations for their own learning. They were, however, significantly more likely to indicate that children would learn better from serially presented diagrams. In direct contrast to the educators, middle school students believed they would learn better from related visual representations presented simultaneously. Experimental data indicated that the beliefs adult non-educators held about their own learning needs matched learning outcomes. These participants endorsed simultaneous presentation of related diagrams for their own learning. When comparing learning from related diagrams presented simultaneously to learning from the same diagrams presented serially indicate that those in the simultaneously condition were able to create more complex mental models. A second experiment compared children's learning from related diagrams across four randomly-assigned conditions: serial, simultaneous, simultaneous with signaling, and simultaneous with structure mapping support. Providing middle school students with simultaneous related diagrams with support for structure mapping led to a lessened reliance on surface features, and a better understanding of the science concepts presented. These findings suggest that presenting diagrams serially in an effort to reduce cognitive load may not be preferable for learning if making connections across representations, and by extension across science concepts, is desired. Instead, providing simultaneous diagrams with structure mapping support may result in greater attention to the salient relationships between related visual representations as well as between the representations and the science concepts they depict.

AB  - This research used an evidenced-based experimental 2 x 2 factorial design General Linear Model with Repeated Measures Analysis of Covariance (RMANCOVA). For this analysis, time served as the within-subjects factor while treatment group (i.e., static and signaling, dynamic and signaling, static without signaling, and dynamic without signaling) served as the between-subject independent variable. Three dependent variables were used to assess learner outcomes: (a) a 14 multiple-choice pre and post-test to measure knowledge retention, (b) a pre and post-test concept map to measure synthesis and structure of knowledge, and (c) four questions based on a Likert scale asking students to rank the cognitive difficulty of understanding four aspects of the animation they engaged in. A mental rotations test was used in the pretest conditions to establish a control and used as a covariate. The treatment contained a four minute and 53 second animation that served as an introductory multimedia presentation explaining the gravitational effects of the moon and sun on the earth. These interactions occur at predictable times and are responsible for creating the tidal effects experienced on Earth. There were 99 volunteer high school participants enrolled in science classes randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions. The research was conducted to determine how motion and the principle of signaling, established in The Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning affected precollege learners. The experiment controlled for modality, segmenting, temporal contiguity, redundancy, and navigational control. Results of the RMANCOVA indicated statistical significance for the within subjects effect: over time for all participants, with time and knowledge retention measured from the multiple-choice results, and in the category "quality of concepts" represented in the concept map analysis. However, there were no significant differences in the between groups analysis for knowledge retention based on the multiple-choice assessment, or among groups over time in the concept map variables "number of concepts," "levels," and "quality of concepts." Additionally, when measuring cognitive difficulty when learning from the animations, no significant differences were measured.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of a scalable concept map based navigation system for a digital textbook. A literature review has been conducted to identify possible methods to promote conceptual understanding in the context of a digital textbook, and these hypothesized solutions will be evaluated through a prototype tool. The primary method that has been selected for this study to promote conceptual understanding in textbooks is the concept map. When concept maps are used as advance organizers or navigation aids for hypermedia documents, they have been shown to promote conceptual understanding. Issues with scalability exist, however. When maps become too large or complicated, a phenomenon labeled "map-shock" occurs. Map-shock is a result of cognitive overload that nullifies the positive effects the concept map has on learning. In order to eliminate map-shock, one needs to manage the cognitive load imposed on the learner. This project proposes using information visualization techniques leveraged from the computer science domain to develop an interactive concept map based navigation system that will retain the positive effects of concept maps, and also present the visuals in a way that does not cognitively overload the user. This study seeks to answer the research question: "How can a large-scale concept map visualization tools be realized in a way that promotes conceptual understanding and manages cognitive load?" To answer the research question, a prototype tool, labeled the "Adaptive Map tool", was developed and populated with engineering statics content. This prototype contains content that is similar to the material in a traditional statics textbook, but the information is accessed through the proposed adaptive concept map visualization. The tool was then given to students in engineering statics class to be used as a supplemental textbook. The effects of the Adaptive Map tool were evaluated through a multiple case study approach that allowed researchers to understand how this tool fit into the larger learning context of a class. Results indicated that some students did integrate the Adaptive Map tool into the learning process, and furthermore that the tool did promote meaningful learning behaviors that lead to better conceptual understanding of the material.

AB  - The primary objective of this project was to learn what effect a computer program would have on academic achievement and attitude toward science of college students enrolled in a biology class for non-science majors. It became apparent that the instructor also had an effect on attitudes toward science. The researcher designed a computer program, the CELE program, for use in instruction on photosynthesis and cellular respiration. The researcher modified existing instruments to assess academic achievement in understanding photosynthesis and cellular respiration and to assess student attitudes toward these topics. The researcher also used concept maps to assess student understanding of the material. The CELE program had no significant effect on academic achievement or student attitudes, which was possibly due to students' not engaging with the program as anticipated. The instructor had a significant effect on student attitudes toward photosynthesis and cellular respiration as well as on misconceptions that were not detected on the pretest but were detected on the posttest.

AB  - Analogies are ubiquitous during instruction in science classrooms, yet research about the effectiveness of using analogies has produced mixed results. An aspect seldom studied is a model of instruction when using analogies. The few existing models for instruction with analogies have not often been examined quantitatively. The Teaching With Analogies (TWA) model (Glynn, 1991) is one of the models frequently cited in the variety of research about analogies. The TWA model outlines steps for instruction, including the step of explicitly mapping the features of the source to the target. An experimental study was conducted to examine the effects of explicitly mapping the features of the source and target in an analogy during computer-based instruction about electrical circuits. Explicit mapping was compared to no mapping and to a control with no analogy. Participants were ninth- and tenth-grade biology students who were each randomly assigned to one of three conditions (no analogy module, analogy module, or explicitly mapped analogy module) for computer-based instruction. Subjects took a pre-test before the instruction, which was used to assign them to a level of previous knowledge about electrical circuits for analysis of any differential effects. After the instruction modules, students took a post-test about electrical circuits. Two weeks later, they took a delayed post-test. No advantage was found for explicitly mapping the analogy. Learning patterns were the same, regardless of the type of instruction. Those who knew the least about electrical circuits, based on the pre-test, made the most gains. After the two-week delay, this group maintained the largest amount of their gain. Implications exist for science education classrooms, as analogy use should be based on research about effective practices. Further studies are suggested to foster the building of research-based models for classroom instruction with analogies.

AB  - Background: This study combines work on concept mapping with scripted collaborative learning. Purpose: The objective was to examine the effects of self-regulated science learning through scripting students' argumentative interactions during collaborative "multimedia-enriched skeleton concept mapping" on meaningful science learning and retention. Programme description: Each concept in the enriched skeleton concept map (ESCoM) contained annotated multimedia-rich content (pictures, text, animations or video clips) that elaborated the concept, and an embedded collaboration script to guide students' interactions. Sample: The study was performed in a Biomolecules course on the Bachelor of Applied Science program in the Netherlands. All first-year students (N = 93, 31 women, 62 men, aged 17-33 years) took part in this study. Design and methods: The design used a control group who received the regular course and an experimental group working together in dyads on an ESCoM under the guidance of collaboration scripts. In order to investigate meaningful understanding and retention, a retention test was administered a month after the final exam. Results: Analysis of covariance demonstrated a significant experimental effect on the Biomolecules exam scores between the experimental group and the control, and the difference between the groups on the retention test also reached statistical significance. Conclusions: Scripted collaborative multimedia ESCoM mapping resulted in meaningful understanding and retention of the conceptual structure of the domain, the concepts, and their relations. Not only was scripted collaborative multimedia ESCoM mapping more effective than the traditional teaching approach, it was also more efficient in requiring far less teacher guidance.

AB  - This article reports that as the need for students to be able to construct and critique scientific argumentation as emphasized in "A Framework for K-12 Science Education" (National Research Council 2012), teachers are wondering how to support students in this process. Scientific argumentation is defined as the interplay between construction and critique involving both individual cognitive activities and a negotiated social act through talk and writing within a specific community. How can teachers engage students in written and oral scientific argumentation? This article introduces four powerful strategies for teaching the practice of scientific argumentation: (1) Visualize ideas using a concept map; (2) Whole-class engagement in a negotiation circle; (3) Time to pause and reflect; and (4) Writing a letter to a younger audience. These four strategies emphasize speaking and writing to facilitate students' engagement in argumentation. These strategies can be used with grades 1 to 6 based on the activity. To facilitate student understanding of core ideas, it is critical to embed language-based activities in the practice of construction and critique. Thus, speaking and writing become absolutely crucial language tools to help students as well as scientists and engineers engage in critiquing knowledge construction.

AB  - The goal of this study is to map the current state of research in the field of metacognition in science education, to identify key trends, and to discern areas and questions for future research. We conducted a systematic analysis of 178 studies published in peer-reviewed journals in the years 2000-2012 and indexed in the ERIC database. The findings from this analysis indicate that the field of metacognition in science education is in a state of growth and expansion, and that metacognition is increasingly integrated into research addressing the core objectives of science education. In contrast to the findings of previous reviews, conceptual understanding of science was found to be one of the central aims of current metacognition research. The studies employ a wide range of instructional practices for fostering learners' metacognition. The most prominent practice is the use of metacognitive cues and prompts in the course of instruction. Several research gaps are identified: first, the development of learners' metacognitive knowledge is receiving less empirical attention than the development of their metacognitive skills; second, there is a lack of studies that employ controlled research designs that can provide causal evidence regarding the effectiveness of metacognitive instruction for science learning; third, there is an insufficient number of studies of metacognition among young learners in preschool and the early years of elementary school; and fourth, there are very few studies of teachers' knowledge and professional development regarding metacognition. The implications of these research gaps are explored and suggestions for future research are raised.

AB  - This study investigated the relative effectiveness of three types of concept maps (hierarchy, flowchart and spider) on the performance of students in Chemistry. This is with a view to find out which of the concept mapping types is more superior in enhancing students' performance in the numerical aspect of Chemistry. The pre-test, post-test experimental design was used for the study. The population for the study comprised of all the Chemistry students in Senior Secondary School in Osun State of Nigeria. Students in Senior Secondary class two (SSII) in their intact classes from three schools in Ife-Central local government area of the state formed the sample of the study. The three schools were randomly assigned to the hierarchical, flowchart and spider concept mapping strategies. The instrument used for data collection was the Problem Solving Achievement Test in Chemistry (PSATC). Students in the three groups were taught using the three kinds of concept maps separately. The experiment lasted for five weeks after which a post-test was administered. The result of the study indicated that there was no significant difference in the performances of the students in the three groups with respect to the kind of concept map used. (F = 1.088; p > 0.05). This implies that the concept mapping strategies were not all that different in their superiority. They all produced a similar effect on the students with respect to their performance in Chemistry. However, it was found out that they enhanced the performance of students in their problem solving skills in Chemistry as already reported by research studies.

AB  - Computer-aided learning (CAL) is used increasingly to teach anatomy in post-secondary programs. Studies show that augmentation of traditional cadaver dissection and model examination by CAL can be associated with positive student learning outcomes. In order to reduce costs associated with the purchase of skeletons and models and to encourage study outside of the laboratory period, interactive web-based CAL modules were developed for a comparative vertebrate anatomy course using skulls on hand, an open source image editor, and a simple text editor. Each module featured images of an animal skull in four orientations and allowed the user to identify individual bones and bony landmarks with a mouse. Study modules and practice quizzes were made available to students through the institution's learning management system for 24-hour access. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - The introduction of digital tools to a distance education environment often creates tensions due to students' past educational experiences and can require a shift in their concepts of the lecturers' and learners' responsibilities. The purpose of the study was to determine how well distance education students adapt to interactive online learning strategies requiring collaboration with peers. Data was collected via two surveys and analysis of student interaction with various digital tools such as chat, wiki, and virtual classroom environments. The results show that while there was some resistance initially to the use of collaborative strategies, most participants in this Early Childhood course reported benefits in using interactive tools for collaboration with their peers. Analysis of satisfaction in the end-of course survey showed that students strongly agreed with the premise that learning is enhanced by discussion and peer interaction, and can be achieved with online learning tools.

AB  - Research has identified the value of students constructing their own representations of science concepts using modes such as writing, diagrams, 2-D and 3-D models, images or speech to communicate meaning. "Slowmation" (abbreviated from "Slow Animation") is a simplified way for students, such as preservice teachers, to make a narrated animation using a combination of modes. In this study, 13 preservice primary teachers learned how to create a slowmation during a two-hour class in a science methods course and then created one about an allocated science topic as an assignment. The research question that guided this study was, "What are the preservice teachers' perceptions of making a slowmation and how was the science concept represented in the animation?" Data included pre and post individual interviews, concept maps constructed during the interviews and the animations as artifacts. Three case studies provide a window into the perceptions of preservice teachers making a slowmation and show how they represented their concept. Slowmation is a new form of student-generated representation which enables them to use their own technology to construct a narrated animation as a multimodal representation to explain a science concept.

AB  - Groups of children at a science museum were pre- and post-assessed with a type of concept map, known as personal meaning maps, to determine what new understandings, if any, they were gaining from participation in a series of structured hands-on activities about bones and the process of bones healing. Close examination was made regarding whether children's prior knowledge or a ceiling effect was influencing results. Children made significant gains in vocabulary and concepts related to both bones and the bone healing process. Many children also demonstrated that their comprehension moved from a novice level to a transitional level of understanding. Prior to participation, children were more uniformly unacquainted with ideas about the healing process of bones than they were about bones; this led to more consistent learning gains related to the healing process. There was some indication of a ceiling effect occurring when children revealed what they had learned about bones, but not when they revealed what they had learned about the bone healing process. Although the prior knowledge theory was not statistically supported, data did show that children with greater understanding prior to the Busy Bones Lab activities end up with correspondingly greater understanding. This suggests that addressing concepts related to bones prior to a lab experience may bring more children to a higher level of understanding before engaging in the lab experience.

AB  - Error in science is a prime occasion to teach the nature of science, especially the central feature of tentativeness. Error types also reflect corresponding methodologies of science, critical for practicing science and (in a context of scientific literacy) analyzing its claims. Effective efforts in teaching about error will ideally be informed by earlier educational perspectives and a schema for inventorying and organizing error types. Approaches using student-directed inquiry have limits, whereas guided-inquiry historical case studies seem appropriate vehicles. On a larger scale, one may also envision a prospective learning progression on successively deeper understandings of error in science. Sample case studies and opportunities for further reading are identified. (Contains 3 tables and 6 footnotes.)

AB  - The seasons are often modeled for students using two spherical objects, one representing the Sun and one representing the Earth. Solely using this model, however, neglects a critical aspect of learning--how students actually see the world. This lesson challenges students to explore seasonal variations as they create and analyze sunrise/sunset graphs for different locations around the world. In the process, students gain an empirical understanding of how and why daylight hours change throughout the year at different locations and the impact that the number of daylight hours has on the seasons. The featured investigation provides a meaningful inquiry experience for students that incorporates three critical aspects associated with high-quality teaching and learning: effective questioning, data analysis, and performance assessments.

AB  - Most students think animals are more interesting than plants as a study topic believing that plants are inferior to animals because they are passive and unable to respond to external challenges, particularly biological invaders such as microorganisms and insect herbivores. The purpose of this study was to develop an inquiry-based learning unit, the Fighting Plant Learning Unit (FPLU), which focuses on plant defense responses to biological stimuli. The study also investigated students' perceptions of the FPLU implemented in a constructivist classroom. A total of 31 Thai science majors from grade 12 participated in this study. Multiple data-gathering techniques (quantitative and qualitative) were employed: conceptual testing, concept mapping, the Constructivist Learning Environment Survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. It was found that from their active participation, the students developed a better conceptual understanding of plant defense mechanisms. In addition, they appeared to have positive attitudes toward the FPLU as evidenced by their preference for inquiry-based teaching in a constructivist learning environment. Finally, their perspectives on and appreciation of plants as active organisms had been favorably changed by the experience.

AB  - The Web is now a standard tool for information access and dissemination in higher education. The prospect of Web-based, simulated learning platforms and technologies, however, remains underexplored. We have developed a Web-based tutorial program (ChemVoyage) for a third-year organic chemistry class on the topic of pericyclic reactions to illustrate this approach with scaffolding and visual auxiliaries. The questions in the tutorial are tiered to simulate the pyramidal structure of knowledge and interlinked to form concept maps required to aid student learning. Visual cues and remedial exercises are linked to advanced questions to facilitate integration of knowledge. Students advance through lower levels to reach higher levels at their own pace. This Web-based learning program provides flexible delivery for the learner and records the learning history of an individual user for the instructor. The diagnostic information helps with reflective teaching and facilitates independence of the learner. Student feedback shows that this is an effective approach in improving their learning outcomes.

AB  - Science IDEAS is an evidence-based model that reflects interdisciplinary research findings that support the integration of literacy (e.g., reading comprehension) within science instruction in grades K-5. Presented is a framework for planning integrated science and literacy instruction in which six elements (hands-on investigations, reading, journaling/writing, propositional concept maps, application activities, prior knowledge/cumulative review) serve as a means of providing students with conceptually-coherent, in-depth science instruction. Reviewed is a multi-year Science IDEAS research initiative whose findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in engendering student science and reading achievement growth in grades K-2 and in grades 3-5 in a manner that facilitates positive transfer to grades 6-8. Based on the results presented and related research, curriculum policy changes that would increase the time allocated to science instruction in grades K-5 are suggested as a means of improving the present school reform movement.

AB  - This study deals with the application of constructivist approach through individual and cooperative modes of spider and hierarchical concept maps to achieve meaningful learning on science concepts (e.g. acids, bases & salts, physical and chemical changes). The main research questions were: Q (1): is there any difference in individual and cooperative modes of spider concept maps' to achieve meaningful learning in science? Q (2): is there any difference in individual and cooperative modes of hierarchical concept maps' to achieve meaningful learning in science? Q (3): out of spider and hierarchical maps, which one is more effective to achieve meaningful learning in science? Q (4): is this concept map is being applicable for constructivist approach? Sixty-four 7th grade students from an Indian elementary school participated in the study. Thirty-four and thirty participants treated through spider and hierarchical concept map approach with both cooperative and individual modes. It was an immediate and delayed test experimental design. Two teaching approaches used for two experimental groups: one based upon spider concept map approach and other was hierarchical map approach. After all, students' immediate and delayed, cooperative and individual map of both groups were scored and analyzed by using, Jena & Panda, 2009 scoring procedure. The parametric tests, such as one-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer Multiple Comparisons Test used to identify any differences between spider and hierarchical map approach, concerning cooperative and individual modes of learning. Both cooperative spider and hierarchical concept map were significantly better than individual learning in science concept. Therefore, concept map is a constructivist learning.

AB  - To provide tools for programmatic assessment related to the use of ACS Exams in undergraduate chemistry courses, the ACS Exams Institute has built a content map that applies to the entire undergraduate curriculum. At the top two levels, the grain size of the content classification is large and spans the entire undergraduate curriculum. At the bottom two levels, the grain size of the content is more fine and tuned to specific course levels of the curriculum. This paper presents all four levels of the map as identified for first-year general chemistry. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Research apprenticeships for secondary students provide authentic contexts for learning science in which students engage in scientific investigations with practicing scientists in working laboratory groups. Student experiences in these research apprenticeships vary depending on the individual nature of the laboratory in which students have been placed. This study explores potential relationships among student experiences in apprenticeship contexts and desired student outcomes (e.g. science content knowledge, understandings of nature of science, and aspirations for science oriented career plans). The following two research questions guided the study: How do participant experiences in and outcomes resulting from an authentic research program for high school students vary? How does variation in participant experiences in an authentic research program relate to participant outcomes? Primary data sources were student and mentor interviews in addition to student generated concept maps. Results indicated that the greatest variance in student experiences existed in the categories of collaboration, epistemic involvement, and understandings of the significance of research results. The greatest variation in desired student outcomes was observed in student understandings of nature of science and in students' future science plans. Results suggested that collaboration and interest in the project were experience aspects most likely to be related to desired outcomes. Implications for the design of research apprenticeships for secondary students are discussed.

AB  - This study examined some of the methodological approaches used by students to construct causal maps in order to determine which approaches help students understand the underlying causes and causal mechanisms in a complex system. This study tested the relationship between causal understanding (ratio of root causes correctly/incorrectly identified, number of correctly identified root-cause links explaining how root causes directly/indirectly impact final outcomes) and three attributes observed in students' causal maps (total links, temporal flow, lateral position of final outcome) that students produced before and after online discussions on noted similarities and differences between students' causal maps. The findings suggest that: (a) causal understanding can be "adversely" affected if students are instructed before group discussion to temporally sequence nodes to flow from left to right and to position the outcome node farther away from the left edge of the map relative to other nodes in the map; (b) causal understanding following group discussion can be "increased" by instructing students to minimize the number of causal links and create a map with temporally flow; (c) promoting temporal flow following discussion may be the most effective means of helping students to identify root causes; and (d) instructing students to minimize the number of links following discussion may be the most effective means to helping students explain root causes directly/indirectly impact outcomes. These findings provide insights on what processes and constraints can be formalized and integrated into causal mapping software when used as an instructional and assessment tool.

AB  - This phenomenographic study documented changes in student-held electrical concepts the development of meaningful learning among students with both low and high prior knowledge within a problem-based learning (PBL) undergraduate electrical engineering course. This paper reports on four subjects: two with high prior knowledge and two with low prior knowledge. Subjects were interviewed at the beginning and end of the course to document their understanding of basic electrical concepts. During the term, they were videotaped while solving problems in lab. Concept maps were generated to represent how subjects verbally connected concepts during problem-solving. Significant to PBL research, each subject's body of meaningful learning changed with each new problem, according to how the subject idiosyncratically interpreted the activity. Prior knowledge among the four subjects was a predictor of final knowledge, but not of problem-solving success. Differences in success seemed related more to mathematical ability and habits of mind. The study concluded that, depending on context, meaningful learning and habits of mind may contribute significantly to problem-solving success. The article presents a testable model of learning in PBL for further research.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different teaching strategies (text-based concept mapping vs. image-based concept mapping) on the learning outcomes and cognitive processes of mobile learners. Eighty-six college freshmen enrolled in the "Local Area Network Planning and Implementation" course taught by the first author participated in the research. This study randomly selected one class as the experimental group and the other as the control group. Students in the experimental group used image-based concept mapping to finish assigned tasks and those in the control group used text-based concept mapping to complete the same tasks. Quantitative analysis combined with qualitative analysis was used to examine the learning outcomes and cognitive levels of the students, as defined by the revised Bloom's taxonomy. The results showed that (1) there was no significant difference in students' learning achievements, (2) the group using image-based concept mapping showed higher level than the text-based group in the dimension of understanding and creating and (3) the image-based concept mapping strategy was more complete and diverse than the text-based concept mapping strategy.

AB  - This study aimed at investigating whether applying pre-writing strategies would affect the quality of L2 learners' compositions. Twenty three adult EFL students from Jahad-e-Daneshgahi English centre in Iran participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to control and experimental groups, including 11 and 12 participants in each. They were at the advanced proficiency level. Each student wrote five argumentative essays. Students in experimental group were treated to perform three pre-writing activities alternatively (concept map, reading relevant texts, and negotiation). The findings revealed that students wrote better compositions as a result of applying pre-writing strategies. Significant differences in two groups indicated that pre-writing activities had significant effect on the participants' writing achievement. The findings may have implications for English learners, English teachers and material developers.

AB  - In the physical and natural sciences, the complexity of natural systems and their interactions is becoming better understood. With increased emphasis on learning about complex systems, students will be encountering concepts that are dynamic, ill-structured and interconnected. Concept-mapping is a method considered particularly valuable for enabling learning in subject areas that are complex or ill-structured. Evaluations of concept-mapping tend to reflect their many applications. Many evaluations that try to measure enhancements in learning use test scores or grade-point averages as performance indicators, which provide little information on how cognitive processes have developed. In this study, a modification of the Biggs and Collis' Structure of the Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy is applied to measure differences in the cognitive and structural complexity of learning outcomes between groups of students who participated in a concept-mapping activity with those from a cohort that did not. The evaluation demonstrated that the intervention was effective in enabling the great majority of students to achieve better connectivity in thinking, though improvements in overall performance were less significant. Almost all students perceived the intervention to be of value to their learning. (Contains 4 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - Inside the globalisation era in which society is immersed, one of the current challenges for any educational system is to provide quality education. While some countries are linguistically homogeneous, many countries and regions display a wealth of linguistic diversity and it is essential to adapt the educational system to those realities. In addition, multilingual education promotes not only social equality but also intercultural education. The development of computer software localisable not only at interface level but also regarding learning resources may help to fulfill this aim. During the last years a number of products have emerged to support computer-based concept mapping. This paper presents a pilot study carried out at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU in the area of database systems with three main aims: to facilitate learning about the subject domain, to evaluate whether concept mapping is in general a good technique for learning topics in different languages, and finally, to verify whether "CM-ED Concept Map EDitor" provides the necessary mechanisms to fulfil this objective. Results confirm that the use of a concept map editor is a good support for education in multilingual settings. (Contains 3 figures and 2 tables.)

AB  - Which science programs have been proven to help elementary students to succeed? To find out, this review summarizes evidence on three types of programs designed to improve the science achievement of students in grades K-6: (1) Inquiry-oriented programs without science kits, such as Increasing Conceptual Challenge, Science IDEAS, and Collaborative Concept Mapping; (2) Inquiry-oriented programs with science kits, such as Insights, FOSS, STC, SCALE, and Teaching SMART; and (3) Technology programs, such as BrainPOP, The Voyage of the Mimi, and web-based labs. A literature search of articles written between 1980 and 2011 was carried out to find studies that met the following criteria: (1) The studies compared children taught in classes using a given science program or practice with those in control classes using an alternative program or standard methods; (2) The program or practice had to be one that could, in principle, be used in ordinary science classes (i.e., it did not depend on conditions unique to the experiment); (3) Random assignment or matching with appropriate adjustments for any pretest differences (e.g., analyses of covariance) had to be used, and studies without control groups, such as pre-post comparisons and comparisons to "expected" scores, were excluded; (4) Pretest data had to be provided, unless studies used random assignment of at least 30 units (individuals, classes, or schools) and there were no indications of initial inequality; (5) The dependent measures included quantitative measures of science performance that were not excessively aligned with the experimental (but not control) treatment; (6) A minimum study duration of 4 weeks was required; and (7) Studies had to have at least two teachers and 15 students in each treatment group. A major finding of this review is the fact that there are very few rigorous experimental evaluations of elementary science programs. After an exhaustive search involving examination of 327 published and unpublished articles, only 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. The evidence from studies that met the inclusion criteria supports a view that improving outcomes in elementary science depends on improving teachers' skills in presenting lessons, engaging and motivating students, and integrating science and reading. Technology applications that help teachers teach more compelling lessons and that use video to reinforce lessons also have promise.

AB  - Due to the broad acceptance of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and other comparative studies as instruments of policymaking, its accuracy is essential. This article attempts to demonstrate omissions in the conceptualisation, and consequently in calculation and interpretation, of one of the central points of PISA 2006 and 2009. The authors point to the danger of such omissions for possible evidence-based education policymaking. With regard to the reproduction of social inequalities through education, we focus on variance in student performance "between schools" and "within schools" on the science scale (PISA 2006) and in the mother tongue (PISA 2009). The thesis of the PISA study is that there are countries (Finland, Iceland and Norway) where between only 14 and 29% of the average OECD variance (33%) is attributed to "between-school" variance--which is "good"--and there are countries (Germany, Bulgaria, Austria, Hungary, Belgium, Slovenia, the Netherlands, etc.), where the variance between schools is at least "one-and-a-half times that of the OECD"--which is "bad." For Slovenia, we demonstrate a significantly different share of variance explained by between-school variance of the same or similar cohort if we move the point of research by only nine months. Our main argument is that such a difference in the share of variance is not the result of a substantial change in the results (grooving difference in the performance) but the result of formal organisational change--the transition of the cohort to upper secondary education. The difference in calculations also radically changes policy implications, which is crucial. While PISA data suggest the necessity of policy measures to reduce between-school variance, our calculations suggest the need for reconsideration of policy measures aimed at the reduction of within-school variance, gender differences, and differences in performance between native and immigrant students. (Contains 1 table, 3 figures, and 10 notes.)

AB  - This study reports on Egyptian science teachers' experiences in collective action research projects with a focus on education for sustainable development (ESD). Science teachers were enrolled in a study course "Teaching Strategies" that had been revised with a focus on sustainability. The course was introduced in the spring semester of the academic year 2011/2012. Throughout the course, 29 teachers worked in groups to develop projects that promote sustainable development through classroom teaching practices that encourage involvement with local communities around school premises. The framework that guided the study was based on experiential, constructivist and transformative learning theories known collectively as "ExConTra". A mixed methods methodology was used where teachers' responses to three open-ended reflective questions produced qualitative data that were analysed by identifying themes and patterns. The author developed two quantitative instruments: a Concept Mapping Rubric and a Sustainable Development Questionnaire. The former was to probe the cognitive organisation participants had in relation to the concept of sustainable development before and after developing the action research projects. The latter instrument was used to identify participants' attitudes towards teaching for ESD and their knowledge of classroom pedagogical practices. Statistical data analysis using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences indicates that teachers in their post-tests had developed: better cognitive organisation for the concept of sustainable development; positive attitudes towards teaching for sustainable development and ESD classroom teaching practices. Involvement in the action research projects where teachers were experiencing, reflecting, conceptualising, constructing, acting and transforming within the context of ESD may be responsible for these results where there are promises to help achieve successful implementation to include ESD in science education.

AB  - Background: Concept-mapping and interview techniques are used to track knowledge and understanding over the duration of PhD study amongst four students and their supervisors in the course of full-time research towards their PhDs. This work is in contrast to much PhD supervision research and policy research that focuses on supervisory styles and roles and may decontextualise the topic and disciplinary setting. Purpose: The work investigates the understanding of the process and product in PhD-level research and supervision. Sample: Participants were four students and their supervisor(s). Case studies were based on longitudinal studies conducted over three to four years (the duration of a PhD). The students were all enrolled in lab-based PhDs in one UK-based higher education institution. Three of the four students were international (one EU-based) and three supervisors were from outside the UK. Design and methods: The data provide documentary evidence of the ways in which these supervisors act to facilitate learning and discovery of research processes and an understanding of lab-based science research supervision. In the initial interview (conducted separately with students and supervisors), the interviewee constructed two maps, one on the topic of the PhD and one on the process of a PhD. In subsequent interviews, the student or supervisor reviewed and updated the previously constructed maps. Transcripts of the interviews were made as well. These data draw on 72 interviews and 96 unique concept maps constructed. The challenges of a PhD being both a process of learning (for the student and the supervisor) and a product of a research project are explored using case study analysis of these four pairs. Findings and discussion: Analyses of the collected data suggested that the students focused more on the product of a PhD (completing a thesis and publication), whereas the supervisors concentrated on the process of learning and scientific development. Conclusions: Evidence in the study suggested product/process differences in the student and supervisor conceptualisation of the PhD. This paper offers development towards a research-led pedagogy of supervision that places the process and product of a PhD at the centre of the supervisory relationship. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - Our study focuses on the correlation of concept map (CMap) structures and learning success tested with short answer tests, taking into particular account the complexity of the subject matter. Novice sixth grade students created CMaps about two subject matters of varying difficulty. The correlation of the complexity of CMaps with the post-test was small but highly significant in both subject matters. The complexity of the CMaps correlated with the long-term knowledge in the difficult subject matter but not in the context of the easy one. Furthermore, the high number of technical errors makes it close to impossible to estimate students' knowledge. In summary, CMaps do not provide an adequate alternative to conventional short answer knowledge tests, but together with them they may offer a better comprehension of a student's knowledge structure and aid in the preparation of further instruction tailored to individual needs.

AB  - Concept maps (CM) are powerful tools which have different uses in educational contexts; however, this study limited its extension and explored its impact on the reading comprehension skill of Iranian EFL students. To this purpose, a proficiency test was employed and 90 intermediate pre-university students were chosen and divided into three groups: learner constructed CM group, fill in the map CM group, and summarizing strategy group. The whole study was conducted within three months. At the beginning of the study, a reading comprehension test (as a pre test) was administered to measure the comprehension ability of the subjects. During the five-session treatment period, the assigned strategies were taught and practiced in each group. Then, another reading comprehension test (as a post test) was employed to compare the effect of treatment on the comprehension skill. The results of the study showed that despite the efficacy of all three strategies, the fill in the map version of CM was the most influencing one. It suggested that in general, CM technique might be regarded as an alternative or even as an effective replacement of the summarizing strategy for reading comprehension skill.

AB  - This paper describes the procedure of developing an instructional tool, "concept mapping" and its effectiveness in making the material meaningful to the students. In Pakistan, the traditional way of teaching science subjects at all levels at school relies heavily on memorization. The up-to-date data obtained from qualitative and quantitative research strongly supports the value of concept mapping as an instructional tool both for cognitive and affective gains. This study seeks to contribute to this development by considering how the insights of Ausubel can be converted into an effective and efficient instructional method. It was found that concept maps help improving achievement of the students and make learning more meaningful so that retrieval is possible.

AB  - Self-regulated learners are expected to plan their own learning. Because planning is a complex task, it is not self-evident that all learners can perform this task successfully. In this study, we examined the effects of two planning support tools on the quality of created plans, planning behavior, task load, and acquired knowledge. Sixty-five participants each worked with two versions of a planning tool. In one version, learning plans were actively constructed by the learners themselves; the other version provided learners with an adaptable computer-generated plan. The results indicated that the quality of learner-created plans was lower than computer-generated plans. Furthermore, participants reported a higher task load when they constructed the plans by themselves. However, participants gained more structural knowledge about the learning domain when they actively created plans. There was not an apparent preference for one of the tools if participants were to create a plan for someone else. However, if they were to use the plan for their own learning, participants preferred to actively create their own plans. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Ontologies describe a body of knowledge and give formal structure to a domain by describing concepts and their relationships. The construction of an ontology provides an opportunity to develop a shared understanding and a consistent vocabulary to be used for a given activity. This paper describes the construction of an ontology for an area of mathematical logic as part of an EU Lifelong Learning project and on-going work exploring how this ontology has been used to inform the development of learning resources and appropriate structuring mechanisms. Finally, the paper discusses future work developing enhancements to a virtual learning environment to allow better integration between domain ontologies and on-line courses. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - The IADIS CELDA 2012 Conference intention was to address the main issues concerned with evolving learning processes and supporting pedagogies and applications in the digital age. There had been advances in both cognitive psychology and computing that have affected the educational arena. The convergence of these two disciplines is increasing at a fast pace and affecting academia and professional practice in many ways. Paradigms such as just-in-time learning, constructivism, student-centered learning and collaborative approaches have emerged and are being supported by technological advancements such as simulations, virtual reality and multi-agents systems. These developments have created both opportunities and areas of serious concerns. This conference aimed to cover both technological as well as pedagogical issues related to these developments. The IADIS CELDA 2012 Conference received 98 submissions from more than 24 countries. Out of the papers submitted, 29 were accepted as full papers. In addition to the presentation of full papers, short papers and reflection papers, the conference also includes a keynote presentation from internationally distinguished researchers. Individual papers contain figures, tables, and references.

AB  - The PISA 2000 study found large differences between countries in terms of quality of learning. In some countries, students prefer rote learning to meaningful learning. However, such memorisation of the material does not lead to recallable and usable knowledge in the long run. Ausubel's (1968) well-known theory serves as a basis for several techniques of meaningful learning, including concept mapping, which emphasises the visual organization of comprehended information. The present study reports the results of an experiment using concept mapping for deepening students' understanding of teaching materials. It focuses on definitions frequently used in science and Hungarian grammar lessons. Results indicate that concept mapping training programmes can improve participants' achievement. Experiences show that the technique of concept mapping is frequently unfamiliar to students. More time would be needed for practising and using it in different learning situations.

The problem is suitable for undergraduate teaching in terms of a project or extended piece of work, and brings together the concepts of geometric mapping, parametric equations, complex numbers and calculus. The Joukowski and Karman-Trefftz aerofoils are studied, and it is shown that the Karman-Trefftz aerofoil is an improvement over the Joukowski aerofoil from a practical point of view. For the most part only a spreadsheet program and pen and paper is required, only for the last portion of the study of the Karman-Trefftz aerofoils a symbolic computer package is employed. Ignoring the concept of a conformal mapping and instead viewing the problem from a parametric point of view, some interesting mappings are obtained. By considering the derivative of the mapped mapping via the chain rule, some new and interesting analytical results are obtained for the Joukowski aerofoil, and numerical results for the Karman-Trefftz aerofoil. (Contains 13 figures and 4 notes.)

AB  - The purpose of this research is threefold: (1) to identify the difficulties that Grade 10 students in a Lebanese school have that hinder their conceptual understanding at the micro-macro-symbolic interface in chemistry, (2) to investigate the effect of a macro-micro-symbolic teaching approach on students' relational understanding of chemical reactions, and (3) to characterize students' conceptual profiles regarding their understanding of chemical reactions in terms of macro, micro, symbolic levels and the relations among them, at the end of the teaching sequence. Forty six 10th graders from two sections participated in the study. A student-centered approach was followed in both sections based on constructivist pedagogy. Hence the teacher played the role of a facilitator who guided students in a meaning making inductive learning process, through questioning, monitoring, validating, and clarifying ideas. Instruction in the experimental group was characterized by macro-micro-symbolic teaching that focuses on the interplay between the levels, integrates various representations, and engages students in an epistemic discourse about the nature of knowing in chemistry. Data sources for the study included a pre-test and two post-intervention tasks: a post-test and a concept map task, in addition to interviews with selected students from both sections. Findings indicated that macro-micro-symbolic teaching enhanced students' conceptual understanding and relational learning of chemical reactions. Besides, four assertions related to students' conceptual and epistemological thinking in response to the different teaching approaches are presented. Implications for instruction and for teacher education programs, as well as recommendations for further research, are discussed in light of these findings. (Contains 5 tables and 5 figures.)

AB  - System thinking is usually investigated by using questionnaires, video analysis, or interviews. Recently, concept-mapping (CM) was suggested as an adequate instrument for analysing students' system thinking. However, there are different ways with which to use this method. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine whether particular features of CM practices affect the valid assessment of students' system thinking. The particular features analysed were the medium (computer versus paper-pencil) and the directedness (highly directed versus nondirected) of CM practices. These features were evaluated with respect to their influence on (a) students' performance in CM and (b) the validity of different CM practices for system thinking. One hundred fifty-four German fourth graders (mean age: 9.95 years) and 93 eighth graders (mean age: 14.07 years) participated in the study following an experimental pre-test-post-test design. Three variations of CM practices were applied: (a) highly directed computer mapping, (b) highly directed paper-pencil mapping, and (c) nondirected paper-pencil mapping. In addition to the CM task, a paper-pencil questionnaire was employed to investigate the validity of the CM practices. Results showed that the computer positively influenced student performance in CM when compared with paper-pencil. By contrast, there was no difference between highly directed and nondirected mapping. Whereas the medium rarely influenced the validity of CM for system thinking, high directedness showed a positive influence. Considering the limitations and benefits of particular CM practices, we suggest highly directed and computer-based CM as an appropriate assessment tool--in particular, with regard to large-scale assessments of system thinking.

AB  - Analogies are parts of human thought. From them, we can acquire new knowledge or change that which already exists in our cognitive structure. In this sense, understanding the analogical reasoning process becomes an essential condition to understand how we learn. Despite the importance of such an understanding, there is no general agreement in cognitive science literature about this issue. In this study, we investigated students' analogical reasoning as a creative process where an environment was set up to foster the students' generating and explaining their own analogies. Data were gathered from pre- and post-teaching interviews, in which the 13-14-year-old students were asked to make comparisons that could explain how atoms are bound. Such data supported the discussion about how students reasoned analogically. Our results made it evident that the task aims and the students' salient knowledge exerted a great influence on the drawing of analogies. (Contains 7 notes, 2 tables and 5 figures.)

AB  - This paper is a mathematical (Boolean) analysis a set of cognitive maps called Thinking Maps[R], based on Albert Upton's semantic principles developed in his seminal works, Design for Thinking (1961) and Creative Analysis (1961). Albert Upton can be seen as a brilliant thinker who was before his time or after his time depending on the future of learning in education on all levels. From one point of view he was behind his times because in the 1960's semantic analysis was passe in academic circles having been replaced by modern linguistics (Smith, 2004, Chomsky, 1968). On the other hand, Upton could be considered ahead of his time because of the emergence of the importance of semantics and formal logic in computer science and other disciplines (Auwera, 2008; Hoenig; 2008; Yamashiro, 2006, Ma, 2004; Ploux, 2003, Lakoff, 1978). The purpose of this analysis is to determine if the reduction of Thinking Maps (TMs), based on Upton's semantic theory to mathematical expressions can give insight into why they have been so successful for learning. In this paper, the question is not if these maps work, but why and how they work. It is suggested that a formal analysis of a set of maps proven to work, David Hyerle's semantic maps ( 1996, 2004, 2006, 2009), will clarify and determine reasons behind their effectiveness. This analysis will help in the better understanding of the use of visual diagrams in teaching and other areas. It is also suggested that this understanding of the why and how of semantic maps will help in the design interactive eLearning software. (Contains 8 figures.)

AB  - This paper presents the qualitative analysis of data from a 20-year project analyzing the knowledge and attitudes toward science of undergraduate students enrolled in introductory astronomy courses. The data were collected from nearly 10,000 students between 1989 and 2009 via a written survey that included four open-ended questions, inquiring into students' knowledge of scientific inquiry, DNA, computer software, and radiation. Trends in students' responses were arranged into concept maps that depict patterns in student thinking. Students' responses were also compared with criteria established by a sample of scientists. Students were familiar with empiricism in science and understood that science tries to explain the world but were not as attuned to the need to support arguments with evidence as scientists would expect. Students had a narrower conception of DNA, yet often related a blend of accurate and inaccurate ideas. The accuracy of students' descriptions of software increased over time, though they were more likely to approach software from a consumer rather than computer science perspective. Students attended overly much to the dangers of radiation, and the accuracy of responses decreased over time. This research demonstrates that students' ideas about science are less focused than scientists would like. (Contains 7 figures.)

AB  - Having used a quasi-experimental research model and the ADDIE (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate) calibration method to gather and implement data, the researcher developed an interactive multimedia assisted learning (MAL) program promoting proper service attitudes in the hospitality industry. In order to gauge MAL program's efficacy, the researcher then designed an expert-vetted exam to be administered to a select number of A University of Science and Technology sophomores--potential industry personnel. The results of the exam, which was administered both prior to, and directly succeeding, a month-long course of study, showed that students exposed to the interactive MAL program (the experimental group) scored significantly higher in terms of "Knowledge of Service Attitude" than those students receiving traditional instruction only (the control group). The statistically significant disparity in scores between the experimental and control groups indicates that interactive multimedia instructional programs can measurably enhance the service attitudes of frontline servers in the hospitality industry.

AB  - Three experiments were designed to examine how experience affects young children's spatio-symbolic skills over short time scales. Spatio-symbolic reasoning refers to the ability to interpret and use spatial relations, such as those encountered on a map, to solve symbolic tasks. We designed three tasks in which the featural and spatial correspondences between a map and its referent (a model) were systematically manipulated using a map-model paradigm. We explored how 2.5- to 5-year-olds learn to map spatial arrays when both identical and unique correspondences coexist (Experiment 1), when featural cues are absent (Experiment 2), and when object and location similarities are contradictory, thereby making both featural and spatial mapping strategies distinct (Experiment 3). Although younger children have a stronger tendency to focus on object (or featural) cues, even 2.5-year-olds can appreciate a symbol beyond the level of object similarity. With age, children are increasingly capable of learning to use spatio-relational mapping and of discovering a spatio-symbolic mapping strategy to solve more challenging map use tasks over short time scales.

AB  - This study investigated the disciplinary knowledge and nature of expertise among political science experts studying American political science. A comparison group of students who had completed an introductory undergraduate course in American political science also participated in the study. Numerous research studies have found that civics and government courses often focus on the transmission of information from textbooks and teachers to students. The result of this type of teaching, at least according to the measures we currently utilize, has been the failure of the majority of students to learn about American government, become invested in our system of government, and indicate their desire to participate in the future. Civic and educational leaders have called for the development of curriculum to promote critical thinking and improve student learning and participation. Yet, there is no research base for understanding what critical thinking looks like in civics and government and its related discipline of political science or what activities and methods will lead to increased student achievement. With history education as a model, where defining the discipline has led to a better understanding of critical thinking in history and a more robust approach to teaching, the author investigated what expertise in this subfield of political science looks like, how experts conceptualize the discipline, and what cognitive processes they use in their work using a concept sorting and mapping task, two problem-solving tasks, and an open-ended interview. Experts defined political science as an empirical discipline focused on phenomena related to government, power, and the allocation of resources. Experts also recognized relationships and connections between concepts in the discipline and used a variety of conceptual knowledge and strategic processing when engaging in their work, including recognition of context, the identification of sub-problems and constraints, and an acknowledgement of what they did not know. A comparison to the students allowed for the description of different levels of expertise. Implications of the study include the need for additional research on the strategic processing of political science experts and the potential to define educational outcomes for teaching and learning in civics and government classes.

AB  - In order to inquire into the persistent underrepresentation of urban minority students in the sciences, this study explored three urban African American students' conceptualizations of school science and media science, with emphases on the representation of science in "Crime Scene Investigation" ("CSI"). Based on the data collected from interviews, classroom observations, student journals, focus groups, concept maps, and artifacts, the study shows that the student participants conceptualize school science as a compilation of observed chemical reactions, utilizing specific laboratory apparatus, and laboratory experiments. The study also shows that student participants conceptualize media science as an accruement of evidence collection, observation, photography, analyses of evidence on and off site, and taking safety precautions. While the student participants did not find school science to be applicable in their daily lives, they believed that they had acquired usable and accurate scientific knowledge from media science. Two major themes emerged from the student participants' voices: student participants' acute awareness of their limited access to the scientific world, and student participants' inadequate accruement of scientific knowledge through school and media science. By attending to the student participants' voices, this study lends support to advocating for and developing culturally responsive pedagogy in science education that will facilitate urban students' active engagement and improve their achievement in science education.

AB  - Students do not pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) because of a lack of ability, but rather a lack of positive experiences with mathematics. Research has concluded that attitudes in math directly influence success in mathematics. As many as 75% of high school graduates in the United States suffer from mild to severe forms of math anxiety. The improvement of student achievement in mathematics in the United States lags behind that of many other nations in the world. Efforts to improve student achievement in mathematics have focused on developing effective teachers and teaching practices, creating state and national standards, and raising test scores. Advances in neuroscience and understanding how the brain learns mathematics are often not reflected in current instructional practices, and being "bad at math" is not viewed as a problem by American society. As a response to the current state of mathematics in the United States, the researcher created an informal educational center to provide positive mathematical experiences that demonstrate how math works. The Metamo4ic Math Center opened in 2007. This study investigated the effectiveness of a two-hour field trip visit to the Math Center on 114 elementary students, six teachers, and 42 preservice teachers. A Math Anxiety Scale-Revised (MAS-R) and knowledge concept map were administered to treatment and control groups pre-visit, post-visit, and post-post visit. Interviews were conducted pre and post visit. In addition, an independent evaluator observed each field trip visit. The results of the study indicated that the Math Center does significantly lessen anxiety and reduce negative attitudes toward mathematics in elementary students and their teachers. Although pre-service teachers demonstrated a lessening in anxiety, the decrease was not significant, and the results demonstrated that the pre-service teachers in both the treatment and control groups had anxiety levels significantly higher than the student and in-service teacher groups. This study led the researcher to conclude that a "Cycle of Anxiety" is contagious and continually perpetuated through the current instruction of mathematics. This study indicated that efforts to improve math achievement void of addressing negative attitudes and math anxiety might not be successful.

AB  - Historically, students have been viewed as empty vessels and passive participants in the learning process but students actually are active forming their own conceptions. One way student learning is impacted is through assessment. Alternative assessment, which contrasts traditional assessment methods, takes into account how students learn by promoting engagement and construction of knowledge. This dissertation explores portfolio-based assessment, a method of alternative assessment, which requires students to compose a purposeful collection of work demonstrating their knowledge in an upper-level biology course. The research objectives include characterizing and contributing to the understanding of portfolio-based assessment in higher education, examining reflection and inquiry portfolio components, determining student knowledge of biological concepts, and investigating student integrative thinking through the transformation of reflections into concept webs. One main finding includes the majority of reflections categorized as naive or novice in quality. There was no difference in quality of reflections among biological topic. There was a relatively equal amount of high and low cognitive level questions. Students' knowledge of biological concepts significantly increased from the beginning to end of the course. Student written reflections were transformed into concept webs to allow for examination of student integrative thinking. Concepts, relationships, and interconnections in concept webs showed variation but declined by the end of the semester This study is one of the first examining portfolio-based assessment in an upper-level biology course We do not contend that this method of assessment is the only way to promote student learning but portfolio-based assessment may be a tool that can transform science education but currently the role of portfolio-based assessment in science education remains unclear. Additional research needs to be conducted before we will fully understand and be able characterize this type of assessment.

AB  - Just as elementary students enter the science classroom with prior knowledge and experiences, so do preservice elementary teachers who enter the science methods classroom. Elementary science methods instructors recognize the challenges associated with preparing teachers for the science classroom. Two of these challenges include overcoming limited science content understanding and a low science teaching efficacy. Based upon research in science misconceptions, conceptual change theory, formative assessment, and science teaching efficacy, this design experiment explored the use of formative assessment in an authentic learning environment to address some of these challenges. As a case study, the goal was to identify two specific topics in science which the preservice teachers did not understand and to model consistent use of formative assessment to guide instruction in those science topics for six weeks. The research questions for this study sought to explore the design of the class while also exploring students' understanding of the science content and their understanding of formative assessment. One specific question was whether the formative data could differentiate between deeply held student misconceptions in science and incomplete science understanding. In addition, data was collected to measure changes in science teaching efficacy as well as preservice teachers' desire to use formative assessment in their own future classrooms. Based upon student interviews and a final content quiz, the participants in this study did show improved science content understanding in the areas of plant food/energy and plate tectonics. The course design implemented a variety of formative assessment tools including formative assessment probes, student science notebooks, student concept maps, a non-graded quiz, and more. The STEBI-B survey identified improved science teaching efficacy among the participants. Student final essays indicated improved understanding of formative assessment and students also expressed a desire to incorporate formative assessment into their future teaching. Final reflections on this case study recognize the value of formative assessment as a means for improved communication between students and teachers about student understanding in an effort to provide and model more effective science instruction.

AB  - To support and improve effective science teaching, educators need methods to reveal student understandings and misconceptions of science concepts and to offer all students an opportunity to reflect on their own knowledge construction and organization. Students can benefit by engaging in scientific activities in which they build personal connections between what they learn and their own experiences. Integrating student-constructed digital concept mapping into the science curriculum can reveal to both students and teachers the conceptual organization and understanding of science content, which can assist in building connections between concepts and personal experiences. I used a qualitative case study research design in which my setting was one third-grade classroom. Participants were the teacher and student in this classroom. This paper describes how a class of third grade students used concept maps to understand science concepts (specifically, "watershed systems"). During class discussions and interviews students revised concept map content and structure as their ideas developed. The results of this study demonstrated how students' understandings and misconceptions were revealed through their construction of digital concept maps over time. Each new concept map built upon the previous one for a total of seven maps per student. Analyses of the concept maps using an evaluative rubric revealed changes over time in concept map structure and content. A formal assessment of watershed concepts was administered four times during the course of the science unit. I conclude that my research model used for integrating concept maps in this science class enabled students to reflect deeply on their work and to accurately revise their knowledge construction and content. Using concept maps to inform her teaching, the teacher also made robust use of the research model. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

AB  - Students often struggle with learning complex chemistry concepts. In today's society with the advances in multimedia technology, educators have a variety of tools available to help students learn these concepts. These tools include demonstrations, videos in the popular media, and animations; referred to collectively as multimethods. With the increase in possibilities educators must consider a variety of factors, the most important of which is their students. An examination of the literature leaves questions regarding the views of students as well as the impact of these tools on student learning. This study qualitatively explores student perceptions and attitudes regarding each of these multimethods using open-ended surveys, worksheets, interviews, and audio recordings. Concept maps and drawings provide insight into how students incorporate information from these multimethods into their understanding of chemical reactions. The results of the study emphasize variety for student perceptions, attitudes, conceptions, and the way they incorporate information from the multimethods. However, there also were trends in that the majority of students preferred demonstrations and the macro level. The students appeared to be aware that the use of these multimethods is designed to help them learn. Student drawings and concept maps additionally indicate a lack of understanding of the nature of chemical reactions and a failure to incorporate the information in a substantial way. Finally, implications for teaching are discussed. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC. Further reproduction is prohibited without permission.

AB  - The concept of liminal space has recently been applied to ways of learning: the learning journey through this space encounters difficulties and misunderstandings, that are resolved as knowledge is mastered. Since 1992 the MirandaNet Fellowship, a growing international community of educators, has investigated the ways in which this relates to the collaborative learning in the liminal space of the Internet. These professionals have explored social networking, microblogging, digital mind mapping, distributed video and other innovative technologies to determine how they can be deployed through grassroots collaboration to build the theory and practice of new professional knowledge. The use of collaborative digital mind maps affords tools for the analysis of the stages and development of collaborative learning. From these shared liminal spaces beyond the screen provocative questions emerge about the relationship between learning, collaboration and innovation.

AB  - Observation competence plays a fundamental role in outdoor scientific investigation. The computerized concept mapping technique as a Mindtool has shown the potential for enhancing meaningful learning in science education. The purposes of the present study are to develop a concept map integrated mobile learning design for ecology observation and to examine the implementation effect for elementary school children. Also, the difference in growth slopes between gifted and average students is investigated. Eighteen gifted students and thirty average students were included in this study. A computerized dynamic assessment system which combines a Computerized Ecology Observation Competence Assessment (CEOCA) and a concept map integrated ecology observation learning design were implemented. The results of the hierarchical linear model (HLM) analysis reveal that the overall growth slope is significant ([mu] = 0.27, p less than 0.01). The effect size is 0.53. The growth slope of the gifted students is a little higher than that of the average students. However, the slope difference between ability groups is not significant. The results suggest that a well designed concept map integrated learning system demonstrates very promising potential for enhancing both the gifted and average students' mobile observation competence. The system developed in this study could be a useful resource for elementary school outdoor learning design. (Contains 4 figures and 7 tables.)

AB  - Concept mapping is a technique that represents knowledge in graphs. It has been widely adopted in science education and cognitive psychology to aid learning and assessment. To realize the sequential manner in which students develop concept maps, most research relies upon human-dependent, qualitative approaches. This article proposes a method for sequential pattern analysis, inspired by sequential pattern mining algorithms generally applied to commercial forecast and decision supports. The method can be programmed for automatic execution and thus reasonably fast, yielding reproducible results. To validate the proposed method, 187 college students were recruited to create respective concept maps on a computerized concept mapping system. While the concept mapping data was analyzed by the sequential pattern analysis method, it was found that the mapping sequences used by students that created superior concept maps were similar and had a pattern in which propositions were formed in a temporal order from more inclusive to less inclusive. Conversely, no similarity was found in the concept mapping sequences by those who created inferior concept maps. The findings support theoretical expectations about concept mapping and are consistent with qualitative evidence based on student self-reports. (Contains 6 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - The term metaconceptual refers to metacognitive knowledge and processes that are acting on and related to one's conceptual system. In this study, metaconceptual teaching activities were implemented to facilitate preservice teachers' engagement in metaconceptual processes. It was the purpose of this research to investigate the changes in pre-service teachers' alternative ideas regarding flowering plants after being exposed to metaconceptual teaching activities. The participants consisted of 32 pre-service teachers who were enrolled in a college level second-year laboratory class about flowering plants. A 13 item open-ended question set was administered a week before and a week after the instructional interventions. In order to facilitate students' engagement in metaconceptual processes, they were exposed to several instructional activities including poster drawing, journal writing, concept mapping, and class and group discussions. Alternative conceptions that pre-service teachers had prior to and following the instructional interventions were identified and the ones that changed, did not change and developed after the instruction were examined. The results of this study show that metaconceptual teaching activities were effective at changing pre-service teachers' alternative conceptions regarding flowering plants. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - High-stakes tests take time away from valuable learning activities, narrow the focus of instruction, and imply that science involves memorizing details rather than understanding the natural world. Current tests lead precollege instructors to postpone science inquiry activities until after the last standardized test is completed--often during the last week of school. Students spend countless hours practicing and taking multiple-choice tests that have little educational value. Learning tests that help students understand science and measure progress at the same time are needed. This article discusses the following topics regarding science education: (1) Learning Test Goals; (2) Teaching and Assessing Lifelong Learning; (3) Visualizations and Assessment; (4) Teaching and Assessing with Concept Maps; (5) Essay Questions, Learning, and Assessment; and (6) Improving Assessment in Lecture Classes. Valuable classroom time can be reclaimed by using online learning environments that incorporate learning tests to measure lifelong learning skills. Think about what would happen if scientists spent time memorizing new facts rather than investigating compelling problems. A focus on lifelong learning to the classroom needs to be restored to retain a competitive advantage in science.

AB  - Mobile and wireless communication technologies not only enable anytime and anywhere learning, but also provide the opportunity to develop learning environments that combine real-world and digital-world resources. Nevertheless, researchers have indicated that, without effective tools for helping students organize their observations in the field, the mobile learning performance could be disappointing. To cope with this problem, this study proposes an interactive concept map-oriented approach for supporting mobile learning activities. An experiment has been conducted on an elementary school natural science course to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only enhances learning attitudes, but also improves the learning achievements of the students. (Contains 6 figures and 5 tables.)

AB  - The present study investigated the influence of concept mapping as a post-reading strategy on EFL learners' critical thinking ability. The study utilized a pretest-posttest control and experimental group design. To do so, thirty six EFL learners at upper intermediate and advanced levels were randomly assigned to experimental (n=18) and control (n=18) groups. The results of pretest indicated that the participants of the two groups were homogenous with regard to their proficiency level and critical thinking ability. The experimental group was instructed to construct concept maps after reading each text and formulated the required post-reading activities on the basis of the constructed maps. Critical thinking skill was assessed via the "Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal" (CTA). The results of posttest indicated that concept mapping has a positive and significant influence on learners' critical thinking ability. The discussion and conclusions of the research are further presented with reference to the finding.

AB  - The processes of curricula, textbooks and student resources development have been broadly surveyed and studied while teachers' guides have received comparatively little consideration throughout recent reforms in science education. Ideal curriculum materials align instruction with the goals of reform. Well-designed teachers' guides contribute to communicating and supporting reform-based teaching. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functions and assistance that guides provide science teachers. A questionnaire was developed and administered to science teachers from a stratified sample of elementary and junior high schools in Taiwan. The findings indicated that the guides were of greater benefit to elementary school science teachers than they were to junior high teachers. These groups of teachers perceived the guides' usefulness differently, but they believed that a clear, concise presentation of the purpose, reminders, answer keys, concept maps of the main topics and learning progression provided the most helpful and preferred layout. Teachers felt that the function of a teachers' guide is to provide teaching resources rather than to guide teacher thinking. This study discusses design suggestions that can engage teacher thinking.

AB  - Our study integrates automated natural language-oriented assessment and analysis methodologies into feasible reading comprehension tasks. With the newly developed T-MITOCAR toolset, prose text can be automatically converted into an association net which has similarities to a concept map. The "text to graph" feature of the software is based on several parsing heuristics and can be used both to assess the learner's understanding by generating graphical information from his or her text and to generate conceptual graphs from text which can be used as learning materials. In this study we investigate the effects of association nets made available to learners prior to reading. The results reveal that the automatically created graphs are highly similar to classical expert graphs. However, neither the association nets nor the expert graphs had a significant effect on learning, although the latter have been reported to have an effect in previous studies.

AB  - Word walls are designed to serve as visual scaffolds and are a common classroom tool used to support reading and language arts instruction. To support vocabulary development in science and support students who are ELLs, Husty and Jackson (2008) created interactive word walls that resemble semantic maps (Masters, Mori, and Mori 1993). Semantic maps are graphic organizers that help students identify important ideas and how those ideas fit together. They visually showcase relationships among concepts and may also be referred to as web or concept maps. An interactive word wall, as opposed to the traditional word wall, provides visual aids that assist in illustrating word meanings and conceptually organize words to deepen understanding. These word walls usually include a visual representation of the word along with a vocabulary label. Definitions are optional. In this article, the authors describe an interactive word wall designed to support vocabulary development in middle-school science students, especially ELL students. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - Open-ended, inquiry-based multiweek laboratory exercises are the key elements to increasing students' understanding and retention of the major biological concepts. Including original research into undergraduate teaching laboratories has also been shown to motivate students and improve their learning. Here, we present a series of original laboratory exercises on fine mapping novel maize mutations producing interesting phenotypes. In this 4-week lab series, students get involved in the whole process of identifying novel genes controlling specific phenotypes, from phenotype characterization and choosing appropriate molecular markers to calculating the genetic distance between the mutation and the marker and finding possible candidate genes using a complete genome sequence. We chose to use maize mutant lines produced by TILLING project. These lines have been partially mapped to a chromosomal bin by a high-throughput bulk segregant analysis; however, the exact map positions for these mutations have never been determined. Mapping these novel maize mutations provides students with the opportunity to conduct original research as a part of their classroom experience and to contribute to the field of maize genetics. The laboratory series was well received by the students, and the assessment results demonstrated an improvement of student learning of gene mapping, molecular marker analysis, and positional cloning concepts.

AB  - The term "restriction endonuclease mapping" covers a number of related techniques used to identify specific restriction enzyme recognition sites on small DNA molecules. A method for restriction endonuclease mapping of a 1,000-basepair (bp)-long DNA molecule is described in the fictitious experiment of this test. The most important fact needed to be considered to solve this test is the reaction catalyzed by polynucleotide kinase. This activity implies that polynucleotide kinase does not phosphorylate circular DNA molecules. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - We describe an investigative laboratory module designed to give college undergraduates strong practical and theoretical experience with recombinant DNA methods within 3 weeks. After deducing restriction enzyme maps for two different plasmids, students ligate the plasmids together in the same reaction, transform "E. coli" with this mixture of ligated DNA, and plate the cells on media that specifically select for hybrid plasmids. The main goal of the assignment is for students to deduce the gene map of one hybrid "Frankenplasmid" using the LacZ phenotype of its transformants, PCR, and restriction mapping. Our protocol results in a number of possible outcomes, meaning that students are mapping truly unknown plasmids. The open-ended nature of this assignment results in an effective module that teaches recombinant DNA procedures while engaging students with its investigative approach, increasing complexity, and puzzle-like quality. Moreover, the modular design of the activity allows it to be adapted to a more limited schedule, introductory courses, or more advanced courses. (Contains 2 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - Recent advances in mobile and wireless communication technologies have enabled various new learning approaches which situate students in environments that combine real-world and digital-world learning resources; moreover, students are allowed to share knowledge or experiences with others during the learning process. Although such an approach seems to be promising and innovative, researchers have indicated several problems when applying it to practical applications, in particular, the lack of proper strategies or tools to assist the students to learn collaboratively in such a learning scenario with abundant content. Students might feel interested when using the mobile devices to learn; however, without proper assistance or guidance, their learning achievements are usually disappointing. To cope with this problem, this study proposes a concept map-oriented Mindtool for collaborative ubiquitous learning. Experimental results from a natural science course in an elementary school show that this approach not only enhances learning motivation but also improves the learning achievements of the students.

AB  - Reflective learning can assist a learner's purposeful and conscious manipulation of ideas toward meaningful learning and knowledge integration. Blogs have been used to support reflection, but Blogs usually do not provide overt mechanisms for students to make connections between different parts of an experience, which is integral to reflective activity. A blogging-mapping tool was designed to support the reflective learning process. The tool allowed students to write blog posts, attach up to five keywords to each post, and link the keywords on a concept map. This study aimed to seek patterns of participants' use of the tool, including evidence of reflective learning, identified as integration between concept maps and blogs. Nine graduate students participated in the study for a semester. Data analysis included examining concept maps for knowledge integration over time. Participants' various mapping activities implied different levels of thinking. Some participants' final concept maps showed signs that they tried to integrate knowledge around the content area. Yet, the inconsistent and inconclusive patterns of participants' concept mapping activities signaled that more strategies were needed to sustain their commitment.

AB  - Four physiology courses participating in a science education program used concept maps for the first time. At the conclusion of the term, students responded to an end-of-term survey about the activity. Following varied results, we sought to identify factors that students indicated are important for the acceptance of the technique. To encourage high student value of concept map exercises, instructors should consider achieving the following: (1) designing exercises to meet educational goals, (2) providing timely feedback by instructor and peers, and (3) clearly aligning exams/assessments with the concept map exercise. Following these three principles, students will not only value but will also see the connection between the concept map exercise and the course assessments. (Contains 3 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - A strong, recent movement in tertiary education is the development of conceptual, or "big idea" teaching. The emphasis in course design is now on promoting key understandings, core competencies, and an understanding of connections between different fields. In biochemistry teaching, this radical shift from the content-based tradition is being driven by the "omics" information explosion; we can no longer teach all the information we have available. Biochemistry is a core, enabling discipline for much of modern scientific research, and biochemistry teaching is in urgent need of a method for delivery of conceptual frameworks. In this project, we aimed to define the key concepts in biochemistry. We find that the key concepts we defined map well onto the core science concepts recommended by the Vision and Change project. We developed a new method to present biochemistry through the lenses of these concepts. This new method challenged the way we thought about biochemistry as teachers. It also stimulated the majority of the students to think more deeply about biochemistry and to make links between biochemistry and material in other courses. This method is applicable to the full spectrum of content usually taught in biochemistry. (Contains 4 figures and 4 tables.)

AB  - In 2004, a group of engineering and education faculty at Virginia Tech received a major curriculum reform and engineering education research grant under the department-level reform (DLR) program of the NSF. This DLR project laid the foundation of sponsored research in engineering education in the Department of Engineering Education. The DLR investigators adopted a spiral curriculum approach to reformulate curricula in general engineering (also called freshman engineering) and bioprocess engineering programs. The spiral curriculum concept recognizes the inherently recursive nature of learning. During this recursive process, students elaborate and strengthen earlier learning, correct misconceptions, develop a more holistic picture of their discipline, and become increasingly self-sufficient as learners. This paper documents the step-wise process that we developed and implemented to rewrite the bioprocess engineering curriculum using spiral theory. Specific examples of learning modules from bioprocess and general engineering are discussed. Assessment approaches and results are presented to highlight the usefulness of such efforts. Adaptation of our spiral curriculum efforts by faculty in other engineering programs to develop a nanotechnology option and ethics spirals is described. We describe lessons learned in three key words: (i) "Patience"--Reformulation results may take time to show up, (ii) "Diligence"--Assessment results are powerful, take these seriously, and (iii) "Awareness"--Students' perceptions may be difficult to interpret. Finally, we discuss the challenges encountered in our unique curriculum reform and engineering education research project and also include a few funding related recommendations for the NSF.

AB  - Fluorescence and phosphorescence are two forms of photoluminescence used in modern research and in practical applications. The early observations of these phenomena, before the emergence of quantum theory, highlight the investigation into the mechanism of light emission. In contrast to incandescence, photoluminescence does not require high temperatures and does not usually produce noticeable heat. Such a "cold light" was the object of an interesting controversy in the 19th century: does it fit into thermodynamics? The early applications, such as the fluorescent tube, fluorescence analysis, and fluorescent tracers, are described. (Contains 13 figures and 4 notes.)

AB  - Conceptual change instruction recognizes that students bring personal, or naive, conceptions to the classroom, which they use to explain their world, interpret situations, and create meaning (Driver et al. 2007). But what happens when students' personal conceptions are inconsistent with experts' views of scientific knowledge? Even after direct instruction, many students are held captive by their naive conceptions. This article describes the conceptual change cycle and provides 10 active learning strategies to help students overcome their naive conceptions of science. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Employers, accreditation and governmental agencies increasingly call for Information Systems (IS) programs to ensure, document, and demonstrate that their curricula embody coherent courses of study that systematically integrate statements of intended learning outcomes. This paper presents a comprehensive and structured curriculum mapping framework that is applied to examine an IS baccalaureate program. The framework assists curriculum as well as accreditation self-study committees to evaluate how intentionally IS curricula advance expected program learning outcomes and ensure that students receive appropriate instruction and assignments in the desired order, so that learning outcomes are effectively achieved in a field marked by technology-driven change. As part of a continuous improvement cycle, the curriculum map, evolving IS model curriculum guidelines, and the outcome assessment data from an IS baccalaureate program are used to revise the existing program. Recommendations are made for use of curriculum mapping in evaluating intended program learning outcomes, program design, course design, course implementation, assessment design, and assessment implementation.

AB  - Using visual models is common in science and should become more common in classrooms. Our research group has developed and completed studies on the use of a visual modeling tool, the Concept Connector. This modeling tool consists of an online concept mapping Java applet that has automatic scoring functions we refer to as Robograder. The Concept Connector enables students in large introductory science courses to visualize their thinking through online model building. The Concept Connector's flexible scoring system, based on tested grading schemes as well as instructor input, has enabled greater than 1,000 physiology students to build maps of their ideas about plant and animal physiology with the guidance of automatic and immediate online scoring of homework. Criterion concept maps developed by instructors in this project contain numerous expert-generated or "correct" propositions connecting two concept words together with a linking phrase. In this study, holistic algorithms were used to test automated methods of scoring concept maps that might work as well as a human grader. (Contains 4 figures and 2 tables.)

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine the thoughts of primary science and technology teachers, primary class teachers, pre-service primary class teachers and pre-service primary science and technology teachers' about concept maps. This scale applied the use of basic and random method on the chosen 125 4th and 5th grade primary class teachers who had science and technology courses and primary science and technology teachers from 14 primary schools in Afyonkarahisar. Also, the scale was applied to 150 2nd grade pre-service primary class teachers and 30 1st grade pre-service primary science and technology teachers in a Department of Primary Education from Mustafa Kemal University in Turkey. The general scanning model was used in this study, while t-test, one way ANOVA test, frequency and percentage values were calculated. However, analysis of the qualitative data was done by content analysis. As a result of the research findings obtained in the framework, teachers' and pre-service teachers' attitudes towards the use of concept maps is identified as positive. According to gender and class levels, which are independent variables, there are no significant differences of pre-service teachers' towards using concept maps. According to the branch and seniority, there are important significant differences of teachers' attitudes towards using concept maps. As a result of the findings from researches, some suggestions are presented. (Contains 12 tables.)

AB  - Systemic assessment questions (SAQs) are novel assessment tools used in the context of the Systemic Approach to Teaching and Learning (SATL) model. The purpose of this model is to enhance students' meaningful understanding of scientific concepts by use of constructivist concept mapping procedures, which emphasize the development of systems thinking. In this study, we preliminarily investigated whether specific SAQs forms are potentially valid and reliable tools for assessing 11th grade Greek high school students' meaningful understanding of organic reactions. Thus, we designed and comparatively tested two "fill-in-the blank" SAQs with specific characteristics, differing in their degree of directedness, their cognitive demands, and their systemic diagrams' complexity. The results indicated that SAQs under study have acceptable validity and reliability as evaluation tools for 11th grade high school students. Additionally, the SAQ form that incorporates a more complex systemic diagram and is "less-directed" and more demanding for the examinees was found to be more appropriate for capturing students' meaningful understanding of organic reactions.

AB  - Adolescence researchers can turn to anthropology to learn the methods of ethnography and cultural comparisons, and they can mine its large database of information on cultures worldwide. But anthropology's single most important contribution is the concept of culture, the mosaic of a group's learned and shared, or at least understood, beliefs, practices, and modes of expression. Although there have been several notable anthropological studies of adolescence in the last decade, in general adolescence has been understudied in the fields of anthropology, and anthropology has been underrepresented in the fields of adolescence research. This article reviews work done by anthropologists that contributes directly to the study of adolescence.

AB  - Social networking sites have seen tremendous growth and are widely used around the world. Nevertheless, the use of social networking sites in educational contexts is an under explored area. This paper uses a qualitative methodology, autoethnography, to investigate how social networking sites, specifically Facebook[TM], can help first semester doctoral students adapt to a Ph.D. program and a new national culture. Each week during the semester, a Ph.D. Student Tip and a Cultural Tip was posted. Students would then post related discussions, observations, and/or questions. At the conclusion of the semester the doctoral students shared their thoughts about participating in the Facebook[TM] group through autobiographical narratives. A technique called open coding was used to analyze the narratives. Our findings suggest three emergent themes. Social networking sites can aid adaptation through: 1) facilitating knowledge exchange, 2) alleviating apprehension, and 3) enabling socialization and building community. The data showed that the Facebook[TM] discussions aided in various types of knowledge exchange, providing a conceptual map that facilitated greater adaptation. Next, the interactions appeared to help minimize trepidation related to embarking on a new program of study and adjusting to a new national culture. Third, the Facebook[TM] group was useful fostering socialization and community among the students. We make the following recommendations for professors when implementing SNS (Social Network Site) groups: 1) establish a Facebook[TM] group with a course-related identity, 2) be sensitive to security and privacy issues, 3) provide tips to "seed" various types of knowledge exchange, 4) encourage participation, and 5) assess and adjust. While our research is exploratory in nature, we believe it provides a foundation for future research in this important and rapidly expanding area of SNS usage. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Open-ended assessments, defined as assessments with a large set of possible correct answers, by nature lend themselves to concerns regarding accurate and consistent grading. This article describes one particular open-ended assessment, named Creative Exercises (CE), designed for promoting students' interconnection of concepts in a college general chemistry setting. The article presents evidence concerning several aspects of validity, including the extent scores represent chemistry knowledge and the extent scoring is consistent across three graders. The evidence is also presented in the context of what is known about concept maps, a commonly employed open-ended assessment in chemistry. Implications for the administration of CEs and the appropriateness of measuring students' hierarchical organization of knowledge are also discussed as a result of this comparison.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education has become a key focus in the U.S. government's public education agenda. Many STEM degrees require the successful completion of undergraduate introductory organic chemistry (O-Chem), which is notorious for its difficulty and high attrition rate. Concept Maps (CM) have been used as a tool to improve teaching and learning by providing feedback to teacher and students. Although numerous studies have examined the use of concept maps (CMs) as an assessment tool in science classes, none to date has examined such applications of CMs in O-Chem. Furthermore, studies investigating the validity of CMs in post-secondary science courses are rare. Thus, the present study investigated the validity of CMs as an assessment tool and their diagnostic uses in O-Chem by examining the relationship between CM scores and other key performance measures in O-Chem. Results indicated that CM scores were significantly correlated with problem set scores and final course grade. In addition, a mediation analysis revealed that problem solving scores partially mediated the relationship between problem solving and final course grade, confirming the role CMs are expected to play in O-Chem achievement. Implications for using CMs as diagnostic and formative tools in instruction are discussed. (Contains 3 notes, 4 tables, and 4 figures.)

AB  - This article reports the results of a small-scale curriculum development project focusing on two of the seven "key concepts" identified in the revised Key Stage 3 (KS3) National Curriculum programme of study for geography, introduced into schools in 2007. The study used "interdependence" and "physical processes" as part of a conceptual framework for creating a "holistic" approach to the subject, underpinned by the notion of threshold concepts. Year 9 students (aged 13-14 years) undertook classroom work investigating atmosphere, oceans, volcanoes and glaciers to develop an understanding of process, landscape, life and futures, while also considering the interdependent nature of these areas, to build an understanding of global physical systems. Use was made of student questioning and concept mapping to create "liminal spaces" in which students could develop deeper understanding of interdependent processes and patterns. Perceptual results from student and teacher interviews suggest that a holistic curriculum was popular and also led to a greater level of critical understanding and a relational underpinning to approaching the subject.

AB  - "Context-based courses" are increasingly used in an address to the major challenges that science education currently faces: lack of clear purpose, content overload, incoherent learning by students, lack of relevance to students, and lack of transfer of learning to new contexts. In this paper, four criteria for the design of context-based courses that would be successful in meeting these challenges are rehearsed. It is concluded that only a model based on "context as social circumstances" would meet the four criteria for success. From this, the notion of concept development is presented based on the idea of the production of coherent mental maps. The notion of transfer is discussed in terms of how such mental maps may be useful for understanding other contexts. The definitions of concept development and transfer give a clearer view of how exemplars of existing context-based approaches may be analysed to show their degree of facilitation of worthwhile science education. Research questions to be addressed in such analyses are presented. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - The ability to appreciate the inter-connectedness of complex biological relationships can be difficult for many students. Graphical knowledge in the form of concept maps and flow charts are learning tools which can assist students to recognise the inter-connectivity. This report focuses on a trial which incorporates these two related visual learning tools using a tablet PC to support their instruction in an undergraduate introductory microbiology class. The objectives of the trial were to introduce both concept maps and flow charts so as to assist students in linking theory with practical knowledge, to make connections within and outside their course of study, and to increase student preparedness and time management in laboratories. An integrated approach to teaching using a pen-based technology with live audio visual in both lectures and laboratories was used. This report details the implementation of the teaching approach focusing on the application of the concept maps and flow charts and how tablet PC technology was incorporated in both settings. The evaluation results of the trial are also reported indicating the impact of the integrated teaching approach on student learning experience and concludes with potential areas for future consideration.

AB  - Concept mapping is discussed as a tool for the visualisation of knowledge structures that can be exploited within biological education. Application of this tool makes it possible to relate the structure of the curriculum to the structure of the discipline, in order to support the development of robust student knowledge structures in ways that reflect the professional practice of subject experts.

AB  - Recent National Research Council reports make compelling arguments for the need to incorporate spatial abilities and use spatial technologies throughout our educational system. We conducted a pilot study to determine the pedagogical effectiveness of teaching with geographic information systems (GIS) by using a web-based GIS tool of Indiana soils. The study was conducted in an undergraduate crop production class over three semesters. We used a pre-test, treatment, post-test design in which students (n = 96) were asked a series of questions designed to test their abilities to understand and interpret spatial concepts. During the spring and fall 2009 semesters, traditional assessments with true/false and multiple choice questions were used. After the treatment was administered, the total average score of 68% for the pre-test increased to 73% for the post-test with a standard deviation of 13%. However, we concluded that these initial assessments focused on the lower levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. Thus, in the spring 2010 semester we switched to using open concept maps to target higher levels in Bloom's Taxonomy. Using a scoring scheme based on a weighted point system, scores increased from the pre-concept maps to the post-concept maps. Paired t-tests showed that the positive changes that occurred with the treatment were significant (P less than 0.01). Overall, a 22% increase in scores for pre-concept map to post-concept map reflected a slight increase in instructional learning. The web-based GIS program received favorable comments from students and proved to be instrumental in providing a rich set of materials that facilitated learner-centered instruction.

AB  - Until recently, the history of debates about language and thought has been a history of thinking of language in the singular. The purpose of this volume is to reverse this trend and to begin unlocking the mysteries surrounding thinking and speaking in bi- and multilingual speakers. If languages influence the way we think, what happens to those who speak more than one language? And if they do not, how can we explain the difficulties second language learners experience in mapping new words and structures onto real-world referents? The contributors to this volume put forth a novel approach to second language learning, presenting it as a process that involves conceptual development and restructuring, and not simply the mapping of new forms onto pre-existing meanings. Following an Introduction by the editor, the contents of this book include: (1) Cognitive Restructuring in Bilingualism (Panos Athanasopoulos); (2) Language-specific Patterns in Event Construal of Advanced Second Language Speakers (Barbara Schmiedtova, Christiane von Stutterheim, and Mary Carroll); (3) Language-specific Patterns in Event Conceptualization: Insights from Bilingualism (Emanuel Bylund); (4) Thinking, Speaking and Gesturing about Motion in more than One Language (Marianne Gullberg); (5) The Art and Science of Bilingual Object Naming (Barbara C. Malt and Eef Ameel); (6) (Re-)naming the World: Word-to-referent Mapping in Second Language Speakers (Aneta Pavlenko); and (7) Thinking and Speaking in Two Languages: Overview of the Field (Aneta Pavlenko).

AB  - Much of the national attention on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education tends to concentrate on science and mathematics, with its emphasis on standardized test scores. However as the National Academy of Engineering Committee on K-12 Engineering Education stressed, engineering can contribute to the development of an effective and interconnected STEM education system. In addition, engineering can provide authentic learning contexts for science, technology, and mathematics. Numerous K-12 engineering initiatives have emerged across the U.S. developing curriculum and conducting teacher professional development. The focus of pre-college engineering education has largely been on process, with engineering content or concepts playing at best a secondary role. Within teacher professional development this lack of focus on engineering concepts is also evident. One key problem confronting engineering professional development observed by Daugherty (2009) in a multiple case study project is the lack of a well-defined concept base. The findings from the individual case studies were compared and summarized across the study's research questions, which included a focus on identifying the fundamental content knowledge. As evidenced by the case studies, engineering content is not well-defined for secondary level education. The projects' leaders, instructors, and participating teachers discussed engineering in terms of the design process and were unable to articulate the associated content or concepts. This void poses serious problems for curriculum and professional development, as well as for research. In the absence of a conceptual base, materials tend to focus solely on design-based activities, lacking a focus on conceptual learning. In order to address this gap Custer, Daugherty, and Meyer (in press), in a study funded by NCETE, identified thirteen engineering concepts deemed to be core to engineering and appropriate for the secondary level. To further this effort beyond a list of thirteen concepts, the current study, also funded by NCETE, convened a focus group comprised of pre-college engineering education, cognitive science, and/or concept mapping experts to discuss how and in what ways concept mapping could be used in secondary level engineering education. The study's research questions were: (1) How can concept mapping be used to facilitate learning in secondary level engineering education?; (2) How can concept mapping be used to assess learning in secondary level engineering education?

AB  - In the past, engineering programmes were developed with separate technical learning outcomes supplemented by generic attributes. The latter were in most cases a standalone set of attributes developed by academic institutions or professional societies overseeing engineering accreditation processes. Although the technical learning outcomes were well assessed and tracked, the generic attributes were at best partially addressed by artificially incorporating them into the curriculum as a way of "ticking-the-boxes". The current trend is to define competencies that map attributes required across the industry and develop programmes that have imbedded tools to deliver and assess these attributes. The Australian Maritime College is progressively developing new techniques to deliver and assess these attributes through holistic tasks, thus, ensuring a broader coverage of the attribute spectrum within an environment of limited resources and time. This provides students with realistic and challenging tasks, a far cry from the traditional mundane engineering laboratories, thus, promoting interactive and practical problem-based learning, making the study of engineering enjoyable! Concurrently with this development is a practical and simple method of tracking and quantifying the achievement of the attributes by the students, yielding useful data to improve processes within the programme, and hence, the quality of the graduates.

AB  - The use of computer games on mobile devices in schools for learning is still relatively new and is constantly evolving. The successful integration of this emerging technology into education requires a longitudinal study into how they are being perceived by learners and teachers. Finding out what works well with children in the terms of technology and pedagogy will be beneficial for both educators and technology developers as well providing an insight into how children learn. This paper is focused on students' perceptions of learning with games using iPod Touches. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were employed including; surveys, interviews, observations and analysis of the children's work. The research involved different steps; finding literature, practical research in a primary classroom, analysing the data as an outcome of the practical research to understand the students' attitude towards learning with games using iPod touches. The overall student perception of learning with games using iPod touches was a positive one. Many described their experience   as "fun", "cool" and "interactive". It was evident in this study that iPod Touches had an impact on students' learning experience by making learning more interesting and fun, but it is difficult to measure if this had any effect on their actual learning.

AB  - Achievement gap language has become associated with the observed disparities on a number of educational measures between the academic performances of Black and White students. This theoretical lens is problematic because it sends an unintended message that Black students are not worthy of study in their own right. Using a mixed-methodological approach, this study aimed to respond to the call of math educator Gutierrez (2008) who urges education researchers to "move away from gap gazing and toward more contextualized and intervention studies" (p. 362). Chapter 2 offers a socio-historical perspective to illuminate the evidence of Blacks' limited access both to mathematics as a discipline of study and a career path. A gap in the literature on the history of math education of Blacks exists, thus Tolley's (2003) seminal study on the factors that influenced the study of math and science for European girls (1840s to 1950s) is used to generate hypotheses about what factors might contribute or inhibit math participation and achievement of Blacks. Chapter 3 identifies four contemporary factors and closes with a concept map combining all eight factors. Along with the historical analysis, 69 student surveys and 12 in-depth interviews provided robust data that revealed an additional four factors--personality style, teacher-student relationships, motivation, and human agency. This study defined success broadly to include not only test scores, but persistence, course-taking patterns, fulfilling college admission requirements, and positive math identities. A mathematical model is put forth as a different way to think about math achievement for Black students schooled in the U.S. The model helps us to understand that Black students' math achievement can be viewed as a summation of a group of factors that are a part of what I call a micro and macro socio-historical background.

AB  - Instructional strategies in science that fail to identify students' initial understanding of scientific concepts may leave students' flawed ideas unchanged, thus affecting their ability to synthesize, differentiate, and connect to new information in science. The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the relationship between concept mapping and science achievement. Cognitive learning theories formed the theoretical framework for the study. The research questions addressed in this study examined whether a significant difference exists between the concept mapping (treatment) and the traditional (control) groups on posttest scores and on test scores across time and group. A one way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to determine if there was a significant difference on posttest scores from 70 third grade students after controlling for pretest scores. Results of the ANCOVA analysis revealed the homogeneity of regression slopes assumption was not met. A two way repeated measures mixed factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine if there were differences on participants' test scores by time and group. A statistically significant effect was found within subjects' main effect across time and between subjects main effect by group. These findings provide a direction for facilitating social change by recognizing conceptual structures that enable students to distinguish the interrelatedness between new and existing knowledge for learning, suggesting implications for effecting achievement in school and in the workplace. This research is significant to educators, administrators, and parents in providing an understanding of concept mapping and the effect on cognitive learning.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of node-link mapping on students' meaningful learning and conceptual change in a 1-semester introductory life-science course. This study used node-link mapping to integrate and apply the National Research Council's (NRC, 2005) three principles of human learning: engaging students' prior knowledge, fostering their metacognition, and supporting their formulation of a scientific conceptual framework. The study was a quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest, control group design. The sample consisted of 68 primarily freshmen non-science majors enrolled in two intact sections of the targeted course. Both groups received the same teacher-centered instruction and student-centered activities designed to promote meaningful learning and conceptual change; however, the activity format differed. Control group activities were written; treatment group activities were node-link mapped. Prior to instruction, both groups demonstrated equivalent knowledge and misconceptions associated with genetics and evolution (GE), and ecology and environmental science (EE).    Mean differences, pre-to-post instruction, on the GE and EE meaningful learning exam scores and the EE conceptual change inventory scores between the writing group (control) and the node-link mapping group (treatment) were analyzed using repeated measures MANOVAs. There were no significant mean pre-to-post differences between groups with respect to meaningful learning in the GE or EE units, or conceptual change in the EE unit. However, independent of group membership, the overall mean pre-to-post increases in meaningful learning and conceptual change were significant. These findings suggest that both node-link mapping and writing, when used in conjunction with the National Research Council's (NRC, 2005) three principles of human learning, can promote meaningful learning and conceptual change.    The only significant interaction found with respect to meaningful learning, conceptual change, and learning styles (Kolb, 2005) was a positive effect of node-link mapping on converger's meaningful learning. However, that result was probably an artifact of small sample size rather than a true treatment effect. No other significant interactions were found. These results suggest that all students, regardless of their learning style, can benefit from either node-link mapping or writing to promote meaningful learning and conceptual change in general life-science courses.

AB  - This book addresses the need to diversify mainstream forms of assessment currently used in Higher Education in order to re-establish the focus on the learning process. Making assessment central to student learning is about returning to what current research emphasises: the primary beneficiary of assessment should be the student. To achieve this in the assessment context, students and tutors must engage in a process of dialogue and feedback. It seems to be widely accepted that assessment succeeds when the learner monitors, identifies and then is able to "bridge" the gap between current learning achievements and agreed goals. It is, however, more questionable whether adequate opportunities are given to students to be active participants in closing what has been termed "the loop". Contributors to this book have responded in different ways to the challenge of enhancing learning through assessment, offering reasons for the lack of focus on learning within assessment processes as well as suggesting possible solutions. The chapters demonstrate a balance between innovation and practicality, drawing on the underpinning theories. The result is both rich in discussion and an extremely useful resource for practitioners. This book was originally published as a special issue of "Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education". Contents include: (1) Introduction: Approaches to Assessment that Enhance Learning (Stylianos Hatzipanagos and Rebecca Rochon); (2) Reflections and New Directions (Paul Black and Robert McCormick); (3) From Monologue to Dialogue: Improving Written Feedback Processes in Mass Higher Education (David Nicol); (4) The Impact of Formative Feedback on the Development of Academic Writing (Ursula Wingate); (5) Beyond Feedback: Developing Student Capability in Complex Appraisal (D. Royce Sadler); (6) Exploring the Use of Peer Assessment as a Vehicle for Closing the Gap between Feedback Given and Feedback Used (Patricia Cartney); (7) A Multi-Faceted Formative Assessment Approach: Better Recognising the Learning Needs of Students (James O. Jenkins); (8) Non-Traditional Learners in Higher Education: Comparison of a Traditional MCQ Examination with Concept Mapping to Assess Learning in a Dental Radiological Science Course (David B.

AB  - Singapore has a high performing school system; its students top international tests in maths and science. Yet while the Singapore government cherishes its world class "brand", it realises that in a globally competitive world, its schools need to prepare students for the twenty-first-century knowledge-based economy (KBE). Accordingly, over the past 13 years, the government has been laying a policy platform conducive to innovative curricula and pedagogy. Despite the government's command and control ethos, and a history of school responsiveness to economic needs, schools have yet to undertake serious transformation in preparing students for the KBE. This article argues that the present focus on innovation in the curriculum, pedagogy and assessment needs to be accompanied by a simultaneous re-configuration in leadership and school organisation, thus generating school-wide transformation. It comprises three parts: the first maps the connectivity between the economic and education development of Singapore since 1965 to the present; the second outlines the human resource implications of KBEs for a twenty-first-century curriculum; and the third maps the transformation of school leadership and organisation that is needed if curricular and pedagogic innovations are to be successful.

AB  - This paper presents a genre-based conceptual framework for designing content for learning objects. Some content aggregation models are reviewed in order to stress the lack of such an approach. In this framework, learning objects are considered as multimodal macrogenres. These macrogenres are constituted of content objects which in fact are several types of digital microgenres. The information linking of content objects can be achieved through particular logicosemantic relations between them. Finally, if adopting this framework, an author/teacher is supported by a repertoire of concepts which make him capable of creating coherent material in order to affect and motivate his/her students in particular ways, through his/her intended social and educational purposes.

AB  - This article highlights examples from a middle-school science teacher's instruction using multimodal texts. Its importance lies in reconciling narrowed definitions of reading (and hence reading instruction) with the need to develop students' critical awareness as they engage with multiple sign systems, or semiotic resources, used for constructing meaning. After a brief introduction to the multimodal nature of scientific texts, the authors ground their discussion of comprehension strategy instruction in a vignette that shows the students and their teacher examining their school's attempt to prevent further soil erosion on the campus grounds. The article also provides examples of how multimodal text instruction in science can lead to making connections to other texts, such as the photographs and maps of America's Dustbowl in the 1930s. Although not without its limitations, comprehension strategy instruction for multimodal texts offers students choices in how they will represent content that matters to them. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - The study examined whether using the retrieval-practice studying technique--in which students alternate between reading a passage and writing memorable information from that passage--improved student learning of a science passage more than the study-once, repeated-study, or concept-mapping techniques. The study found that students using the retrieval-practice technique scored significantly higher than students using the study-once, repeated-study, and concept-mapping techniques. The average percent of correct test questions for each group was 67% for retrieval practice, 27% for study once, 49% for repeated study, and 45% for concept mapping. The research described in this report meets the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) evidence standards. [The following study is the focus of this "Quick Review": Karpicke, J. D., & Blunt, J. R. (2011).

AB  - The study examined the effect of concept-mapping and problem-solving teaching strategies on achievement in biology among Nigerian secondary school students. The method used for the study was a quasi-experimental pre-test treatment design. One hundred and thirteen senior secondary three (S.S. 111) students randomly selected from three mixed secondary schools located in Delta North Senatorial District of Delta State, Nigeria were used as subjects for the study. The experimental group was taught selected topics in Genetics using concept-mapping and problem-solving strategies while the control group was taught using the traditional lecture method. The result of the study showed that the experimental group performed significantly better in Genetics than the control group and that gender does not affect students achievement in biology in general.

AB  - Analogies are often used in science, but students may not appreciate their significance, and so the analogies can be misunderstood or discounted. For this reason, educationalists often express concern about the use of analogies in teaching. Given the important place of analogies in the discourse of science, it is necessary that students are explicitly shown how they work, perhaps based on the structure-mapping theory we outline here. When using an analogy, the teacher should very clearly specify both its components and its limitations. Great care is required in developing an analogy to ensure that it is understood as intended and that misconceptions are minimized. This approach models the behavior of a scientist, which helps to develop student understanding of the practice of science. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - This case study draws attention to Pedro's story, a Grade 6 Latino teacher who, along with other grade 4-6 teachers, participated in a three-year professional development research project. By using data analyzed from multiple ethnographic interviews with teachers and students, and by drawing from the quantitative analyzes of concept map unit tests, we illustrate how Pedro's significant professional growth and his students' learning were truncated by top-down school district policies. These policies were implemented because of the punitive nature of the No Child Left Behind Act. Simply put, this case study exposes the impact of "opp(reg)ressive policies" on learning, that is, policies simultaneously oppressive and regressive. The critical perspective of the project, and its emphasis on assisting teachers to make their pedagogy and curriculum more culturally and socially relevant, was informed by sociotransformative constructivism (sTc). This is a theoretical framework that affords equal importance to cross-cultural education (learning about and acting on socially/culturally relevant issues) and social constructivism (learning to critically produce and consume knowledge). We hope that this case study will provide additional insights into the slow progress we continue to make in science teacher professional development and in closing the achievement gap.

AB  - One valuable goal of instructional technologies in K-12 education is to prepare students for future learning. Two classroom studies examined whether Teachable Agents (TA) achieves this goal. TA is an instructional technology that draws on the social metaphor of teaching a computer agent to help students learn. Students teach their agent by creating concept maps. Artificial intelligence enables TA to use the concept maps to answer questions, thereby providing interactivity, a model of thinking, and feedback. Elementary schoolchildren learning science with TA exhibited "added-value" learning that did not adversely affect the "basic-value" they gained from their regular curriculum, despite trade-offs in instructional time. Moreover, TA prepared students to learn new science content from their regular lessons, even when they were no longer using the software. (Contains 8 figures.)

AB  - To help in interpreting the polarity of a molecule, charge separation can be visualized by mapping the electrostatic potential at the van der Waals surface using a color gradient or by indicating positive and negative regions of the electrostatic potential using different colored isosurfaces. Although these visualizations capture the molecular charge distribution efficiently, using them to deduce "overall polarity" requires students to engage in the potentially demanding process of interpreting the relative positions of electron-rich and electron-poor areas. We present a visual tool that could help students assign polarity by exploiting the unique topography of the interface between negative and positive regions of electrostatic potential surrounding a molecule. Specifically, the tool renders the electrostatic potential isosurface(s) of a molecule obtained when the isovalue is set at 0. Examples of polar and nonpolar molecules are discussed.

AB  - This study examines the process by which system thinking perceptions develop within the context of a water cycle curriculum. Four junior high school students undergoing an especially designed inquiry-based intervention were closely observed before, during, immediately after, and 6 years after completing a year long systems-based learning program. The employed research tools included observations, semi-structured interviews, and a number of "concept viewing" tools (drawings, concept maps, and repertory grids). Out of the data, four distinct "stories," each presenting a different way of constructing hydro system mental models, are described. The paper's main conclusion is that students develop their systems mental models and remember the learned material based on learning patterns that tend to remain unchanged over time. Consequently, in order to facilitate efficient and lasting construction of students' system models, learning experiences should harness these, and especially the meta-cognitive learning pattern, which holds special significance for constructing systems.

AB  - For beginning teachers to make the transition to full professional membership they need to increase their professional knowledge of the art and science of teaching. This paper explores the difference in knowledge growth between beginning teachers who commence teaching in fragmented teaching situations in the first two years of teaching, and their colleagues who have stable, secure and continuing employment during this time. This paper argues that the employment context in which beginning teachers take up their profession has a significant, but hitherto largely unacknowledged, effect on the capacity of teachers to develop the craft of teaching (Elbaz, 1983); on their continuing commitment to the profession; and on their self-confidence and self-image as teachers It is concluded that long-term, secure employment in one school, with full responsibility for a class of students and access to effective mentoring, is necessary if beginning teachers are to move beyond "survival" to developing competency in the first two years of teaching.

AB  - As part of a campus-wide, externally funded project to increase performance in, enthusiasm for, and retention within STEM disciplines, we developed an interdisciplinary, team-taught first-year seminar course. The construction and delivery of this course was designed to show the relevance of selected general chemistry topics such as matter and energy to students in STEM disciplines outside of chemistry, particularly to pre-engineering students. Centered on a "science in space" theme, students in the course participated in a series of hands-on, open-ended activities adapted from the chemical education literature. Concept maps were used as assessment tools to measure improvement of cognition, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. These instruments were also useful in evaluating the students' grasp of relevance regarding general chemistry topics. At the end of the course, participating students have shown improvement in all targeted skill areas and articulate the relevance of chemistry to engineering, physics, and other STEM disciplines. Additionally, students participating in this program have increased academic success during their first year and beyond, as measured by retention, test performance, GPA, and progression metrics.

AB  - Data were gathered from 248 secondary students (14 years old, 56% female) who learned about the circulatory system in 77 self-selected collaborative groups. The learning outcomes of biology students who summarised by collaborative concept mapping were compared with those of students who summarised by collaborative writing. Learning groups randomly assigned to construct concept maps instead of conventional summaries generated more relations in the summary task and their members obtained higher individual scores on a post-test. The concept mapping strategy was found to be advantageous only for students whose cognitive ability was below the median for the sample and who were placed in groups with other students having low cognitive ability.

AB  - The process of transforming students from novices into experts relies on active learning and the development of an appreciation for the links among topics. Since rote or stimulus-response learning is preferred by a majority of students who are beginning their programs of study but does not optimize learning and understanding, the first step in the process is changing students' preference to active learning. As students progress from 100- to 400-level courses, this outcome can be accomplished by reducing the amount of class time that instructors dedicate to lectures that introduce new material and increasing the amount of time dedicated to active learning strategies. Because of PowerPoint's linear structure, teachers can foster learning by supplementing traditional slides with tables, charts, graphs, and concept maps that explicate the links among topics. Concept maps also lend themselves to assessing students' mastery of concepts and the value added by class discussions. Both measures enable instructors to enhance their teaching effectiveness and, over time, use class sessions more efficiently.

AB  - This paper explores conceptual variation in the depiction of gene function in upper secondary school textbooks. Historically, concepts in genetics have developed in various scientific frameworks, which has led to a level of incommensurability as concepts have changed over time within their respective frameworks. Since students may have difficulties in understanding concepts where there is implicit variation in descriptions of the same phenomena, we have developed a concept mapping instrument and applied it to study the gene function concepts in biology and chemistry textbooks that are widely used in Sweden, and others used in a selection of English speaking countries. The data were then further examined using content analysis. In the present paper we describe the conceptual variation of gene function as it is presented in the textbooks, and analyze the ways in which students' understanding may be influenced. We conclude that it may be difficult for students to gain a modern, process-oriented understanding of gene function if textbooks are used as foundations for the planning and execution of lessons.

AB  - The aim of this study is to argue for alternative assessment methods (i.e. concept map) considering the changes in demography in higher education. In the case of school of dentistry, for example, there is an urgent call for a catalyst for new assessment methods in dental education in view of the drive to comprehensively assess professional competence to cater to the current work requirement; this quantitative study compared two different approaches to assessment following a first-year undergraduate course for dental and hygiene and therapy students. The assessment methods compared were multiple-choice questions and concept mapping. The data suggest that concept mapping can be appropriate for non-traditional students (i.e. adult learners), particularly those who already have professional experience in related practice. This is because concept mapping allows learners to locate their new knowledge in a broader social and experiential frame. The implications are discussed. (Contains 5 notes, 4 tables, and 3 figures.)

AB  - Motivated by a long-term goal in education for measuring Taiwanese civic scientific literacy in media (SLiM), this work reports the detailed techniques to efficiently mine a concept map from 2 years of Chinese news articles (901,446 in total) for SLiM instrument development. From the Chinese news stories, key terms (important words or phrases), known or new to existing lexicons, were first extracted by a simple, yet effective, rule-based algorithm. They were subjected to an association analysis based on their co-occurrence in sentences to reveal their term-to-term relationship. A given list of 3657 index terms from science textbooks were then matched against the term association network. The resulting term network (including 95 scientific terms) was visualized in a concept map to scaffold the instrument developers. When developing an item, the linked term pair not only suggests the topic for the item due to the clear context being mutually reinforced by each other, but also the content itself because of the rich background provided by the recurrent snippets in which they co-occur. In this way, the resulting instrument (comprised of 50 items) reflect the scientific knowledge revealed in the daily news stories, meeting the goal for measuring civic scientific literacy in media. In addition, the concept map mined from the texts served as a convenient tool for item classification, developer collaboration, and expert review and discussion. (Contains 9 figures.)

AB  - This study used scientometric methods to conduct an automatic content analysis on the development trends of science education research from the published articles in the four journals of "International Journal of Science Education, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, Research in Science Education, and Science Education" from 1990 to 2007. The multi-stage clustering technique was employed to investigate with what topics, to what development trends, and from whose contribution that the journal publications constructed as a science education research field. This study found that the research topic of "Conceptual Change & Concept Mapping" was the most studied topic, although the number of publications has slightly declined in the 2000s. The studies in the themes of "Professional Development," "Nature of Science and Socio-Scientific Issues," and "Conceptual Change and Analogy" were found to be gaining attention over the years. This study also found that, embedded in the most cited references, the supporting disciplines and theories of science education research are constructivist learning, cognitive psychology, pedagogy, and philosophy of science.

AB  - This paper explores the occurrence of conceptual incoherence in upper secondary school textbooks resulting from the use of multiple historical models. Swedish biology and chemistry textbooks, as well as a selection of books from English speaking countries, were examined. The purpose of the study was to identify which models are used to represent the phenomenon of gene function in textbooks and to investigate how these models relate to historical scientific models and subject matter contexts. Models constructed for specific use in textbooks were identified using concept mapping. The data were further analyzed by content analysis. The study shows that several different historical models are used in parallel in textbooks to describe gene function. Certain historical models were used more often then others and the most recent scientific views were rarely referred to in the textbooks. Hybrid models were used frequently, i.e. most of the models in the textbooks consisted of a number of components of several historical models. Since the various historical models were developed as part of different scientific frameworks, hybrid models exhibit conceptual incoherence, which may be a source of confusion for students. Furthermore, the use of different historical models was linked to particular subject contexts in the textbooks studied. The results from Swedish and international textbooks were similar, indicating the general applicability of our conclusions.

AB  - Understanding of Earth's systems, including the crucial role of human beings within them, is an important part of citizens' ability to think intelligently and critically about the environment, pollution, sustainability and other socio-economic and scientific issues central to life in the modern world. Part of this understanding involves seeing the world as an integrated whole in which what happens in diverse places in the world may be equally relevant for students' lives. In this regard, it makes sense to study both remote and local environments within the system thinking approach--where such distinctions naturally become blurred. The present research, accordingly, focuses on a study unit entitled "Life at the Poles" and investigates the development of junior high school students' understanding of Earth systems and their level of conceptual complexity as a result of participating in it. The "Life at the Poles" unit is based on the "explanatory story" approach where one central theme is used as a focal point for an interdisciplinary study of certain natural phenomena, in this case, the possibility of life under the extreme conditions at the poles. Concept maps and Likert-type questionnaires were employed as research tools, allowing the collected data to be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The research findings indicate that the students significantly improved their Earth systems understanding and, importantly, greatly increased their awareness of human beings' influence on the environment, including remote environments such as the pole.

AB  - Two experiments investigated the effects of characteristic features of concept mapping used for prior knowledge activation. Characteristic demands of concept mapping include connecting lines representing the relationships between concepts and labeling these lines, specifying the type of the semantic relationships. In the first experiment, employing a within-subjects design, 20 psychology students completed a label-provided-lines economics mapping task and then a create-and-label-lines meteorology mapping task or vice versa. The analysis of 40 think-aloud protocols indicated more elaboration processes for the label-provided-lines task than for the create-and-label-lines task. On the other hand, the protocols indicated more model-construction and organization processes in the create-and-label-lines task. The second experiment used the same variation but focused on learning outcomes and perceived self-efficacy as dependent measures. Forty-two psychology students were randomly assigned to either a label-provided-lines mapping task or a create-and-label-lines mapping task. Subsequently, both groups completed a learning phase in a hypertext environment and a posttest. Results showed substantial differences in learning outcomes and perceived self-efficacy in favor of the label-provided-lines prior knowledge activation task. The findings are congruent with coherence effects found in text-comprehension research and support the position that concept mapping should not be seen as a unitary method but be differentiated according to the specific tasks to be completed.

AB  - The learning outcome of a physics laboratory course for medical students was examined in an interdisciplinary field study and discussed for the electrical physiology ("Propagation of Excitation and Nerve Cells"). At the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich (LMU) at a time about 300 medicine students were assessed in two successive years. Students from the control group worked with standard experiments, while students from the treatment group performed newly developed "addressee-specific" experiments, designed to guide students to transfer physics knowledge to physiological problems. The assessment took place within the laboratory course on physiology, after the students had finished their laboratory classes in physics, and consisted of the construction of a concept map with additional multiple choice questions. The results showed that standard physics experiments are not adequate for teaching students to transfer physical principles to physiology. Introducing new addressee-specific experiments enriched the physics laboratory course by improving student attitudes toward physics and demonstrating better ability of students to relate concepts of physics and medicine, and overall to improve their understanding of the physics taught in the course.

AB  - Conceptual change is often described as a causal process in which changes in an embraced system of beliefs result in a new system of beliefs. Here, it is argued that conceptual change is better understood as an intentional activity with regard to the learner, that is, what the learner is doing when trying to understand something. Children were interviewed every year during a period of 3 years from their ages of 4-6 years of age. In the study, there were 37 children participating, of which 29 were followed during all 3 years. They were asked to tell about their beliefs about the earth, and their developing understanding is described. The results show that in the conceptual changes the children's main concern was to restructure the often vast amount of knowledge they possessed. This reconstruction is described as a simultaneous reconstruction of conceptual contexts as well as contexts for their application. This also directs the focus of conceptual change from specific conceptions to structural changes. (Contains 6 figures and 2 tables.)

AB  - Our study monitored the cognitive and motivational effects within different educational instruction schemes: On the one hand, teacher-centred versus hands-on instruction; on the other hand, hands-on instruction with and without a knowledge consolidation phase (concept mapping). All the instructions dealt with the same content. For all participants, the hands-on approach as well as the concept mapping adaptation were totally new. Our hands-on approach followed instruction based on "learning at work stations". A total of 397 high-achieving fifth graders participated in our study. We used a pre-test, post-test, retention test design both to detect students' short-term learning success and long-term learning success, and to document their decrease rates of newly acquired knowledge. Additionally, we monitored intrinsic motivation. Although the teacher-centred approach provided higher short-term learning success, hands-on instruction resulted in relatively lower decrease rates. However, after six weeks, all students reached similar levels of newly acquired knowledge. Nevertheless, concept mapping as a knowledge consolidation phase positively affected short-term increase in knowledge. Regularly placed in instruction, it might increase long-term retention rates. Scores of interest, perceived competence and perceived choice were very high in all the instructional schemes. (Contains 4 tables, 4 figures and 2 notes.)

AB  - This study aimed to determine how 33 urban 5th grade students' science conceptions changed during a place-based inquiry unit on watersheds. Research on watershed and place-based education was used as a framework to guide the teaching of the unit as well as the research study. A teacher-researcher designed the curriculum, taught the unit and conducted the research using qualitative data sources such as concept maps, science notebooks and interviews. Most students came to understand that their watershed was part of an urban environment where water drains from the surrounding land into a body of water. Thus, they began to understand how urban land use affects water quality. This study provides evidence for the use of place-based learning in developing students' knowledge of the "National Science Education Standards" (NRC, 1996) and watersheds. Implications of this study include the use of place-based learning in urban settings and the experiences needed for students to conceptualize watersheds. (Contains 5 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - Acquisition of conceptual knowledge is a central aim in science education. In this study we monitored an interdisciplinary hypermedia assisted learning unit on hibernation and thermodynamics based on cooperative learning. We used concept mapping for the assessment, applying a pre-test/post-test design. In our study, 106 9th graders cooperated by working in pairs (n = 53) for six lessons. As an interdisciplinary learning activity in such complex knowledge domains has to combine many different aspects, we focused on long-term knowledge. Learners working cooperatively in dyads constructed computer-supported concept maps which were analysed by specific software. The data analysis encompassed structural aspects of the knowledge corresponding to a target reference map. After the learning unit, the results showed the acquisition of higher-order domain-specific knowledge structures which indicates successful interdisciplinary learning through the hypermedia learning environment. The benefit of using a computer-assisted concept mapping assessment for research in science education, and in science classrooms is considered.

AB  - This article discusses a new project that aims to encapsulate all the key features of the new Curriculum for Excellence. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) funding was secured to support this emergent joint ASE/Technical Teachers' Association (TTA) initiative, with Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS) and Determined to Succeed (DtS) also coming on board. Each central starter theme with spin-off sub-themes will be presented in the form of 3 interrelated ideas maps, one each for three overlapping age zones: (1) pre-school to primary 2; (2) primary 3 to primary 7; and (3) secondary 1 to 3. These are "soft" zones; differentiation and teacher choice will frequently result in teachers selecting work from a different chronological zone according to the capabilities of their pupils. Some sub-themes run across all age zones, some sensibly only cover two of the zones.

AB  - This study explored the effectiveness of an inquiry-based cellulase laboratory unit in promoting inquiry in undergraduate students in biotechnology. The following tools were used to assess the students' achievements and attitude: conceptual understanding test, concept mapping, students' documents, CLES questionnaire, students' self reflection, and interviews. Judging from their conceptual understanding test results and concept mapping, students gained significantly more content knowledge on enzyme-substrate interaction and its application. In addition, students' reports on their projects revealed that they have developed their critical thinking, scientific process skills and abilities to apply knowledge on enzyme cellulase to industrial application. The students reacted positively to this teaching strategy as demonstrated by results from questionnaire responses, students' self reflection and interviews. The success of this inquiry-based laboratory unit might be due to both the context which was of interest to students, and the instruction method which ranged from a guided to a more open inquiry. Most importantly, the teacher in this study had mastery of both content and pedagogical techniques. This inquiry-based cellulase laboratory unit provided significant benefits for teaching and learning science for biotechnology students. It promoted acquisition of content knowledge and skills such as asking good questions, predicting, problem solving, drawing conclusion, and communication. This inquiry-based laboratory unit may serve as a guideline or framework for implementing a dynamic instruction with a range of inquiry level for the undergraduates.

AB  - The present study conducted to investigate the contribution of conceptual change texts, accompanied by concept mapping instruction to eleventh-grade students' understanding of cellular respiration concepts, and their retention of this understanding. Cellular respiration concepts test was developed as a result of examination of related literature and interviews with teachers regarding their observations of students' difficulties. The test was administrated as pre-test, post-test, and delayed post-test to a total of 70 eleventh-grade students in two classes of the same high school in an urban area, taught by the same teacher. The experimental group was a class of 34 students who received conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping instruction. A class of 36 students comprised the control group who received traditional instruction. Besides treatment, previous understanding and logical thinking ability were other independent variables involved in this study. The results showed that logical thinking, treatment, previous understanding of cellular respiration concepts each made a statistically significant contribution to the variation in students' understanding of cellular respiration concepts. The result also showed that conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping instruction was significantly better than traditional instruction in retention of this understanding.

AB  - Introduction: We examine relationships between information literacy and information ecology with regard to conceptual innovation in information science. We aim to expand our understanding of human information behaviour and relevance assessment in the electronic environment. Method: Conceptual analysis and conceptual mapping is used and relationships of main concepts are determined in a concept map. Earlier empirical research on information behaviour styles and relevance assessment using surveys and interviews are synthesized. Analysis: Two information styles (pragmatic and analytic) are characterized. Relevance assessment in the electronic environment is analysed. Relevance is considered as part of information literacy. Examples of students' information horizons and a concept map of relevance are given. Results: Ecological dimensions of information literacy are determined at semantic (relevance), visual (information horizon, concept maps) and behavioural and social levels (information styles). A model of ecological dimensions of information literacy is outlined based on triangle of values, tools and communities. Recommendations for development of students' information literacy are presented at levels of information seeking and relevance assessment. Conclusions: Implications for information literacy development in the electronic environments and for information and educational strategies are derived. Relevance assessment should be actively trained as part of information literacy and guided inquiry. Ecological dimensions of information literacy can be used in new models of e-learning and digital libraries. (Contains 4 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - Concept mapping is a technique used to provide a visual representation of an individual's ideas about a concept or set of related concepts. This paper describes a concept mapping tool using a photograph association technique (CoMPAT) that is considered to be a novel way of eliciting children's ideas. What children at 11 years of age know about particular concepts related to microbial activity is presented and discussed in relation to the effectiveness of CoMPAT as a tool to draw out their ideas. It is proposed that this tool could be used to explore ideas about this and other science concepts from children in other age groups, and where language may be a barrier to participation.

AB  - This article describes how science can lead whole-school curriculum change at key stage 3 (ages 11-14). Two thematic curriculum models are described. Model 1 shows how science specialists can develop student understanding of how science interrelates to a variety of other subject areas, while Model 2 shows how science might help to create a "learning community" of subject specialists through concept mapping across subject areas. Both models encourage collaborative approaches to curriculum design and ultimately learning, with a major emphasis being placed on science, its relationship with other curriculum areas and its importance in our society.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to evaluate a collaborative concept-mapping technique that was integrated into coteaching in fourth-grade science classes in order to examine students' performance and attitudes toward the experimental teaching method. There are two fourth-grade science teachers and four classes with a total of 114 students involved in the study. This study used a mixed method design, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The findings showed that the two teaching methods obtained significant difference with respect to students' test scores. Using collaborative concept mapping to learn science could increase the opportunity of discussion between peers, thus fostering better organization and understanding the content. In addition, coteaching could enable teachers to share their expertise with one another. It could facilitate the implementation of collaborative concept mapping and the construction of student's concept mapping. Team teachers' attitude could affect the students' learning performance. However, some of the students had negative views on drawing concept maps because they found it was troublesome to write down many words, difficult to draw and arrange proposition, and time-consuming. Coteachers' instant feedback and students' journal writing could guide and examine the students' concept maps to facilitate their cognitive learning. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - This study (1) explores the effectiveness of the contextualized history of science on student learning of nature of science (NOS) and genetics content knowledge (GCK), especially interrelationships among various genetics concepts, in high school biology classrooms; (2) provides an exemplar for teachers on how to utilize history of science in genetics instruction; and (3) suggests a modified concept mapping assessment tool for both NOS and GCK. A quasi-experimental control group research design was utilized with pretests, posttests, and delayed posttests, combining qualitative data and quantitative data. The experimental group was taught with historical curricular lessons, while the control group was taught with non-historical curricular lessons. The results indicated that students in the experimental group developed better understanding in targeted aspects of NOS immediately after the intervention and retained their learning 2 months after the intervention. Both groups developed similar genetics knowledge in the posttest, and revealed a slight decay in their understanding in the delayed posttest.

AB  - This study describes how a group of grade 7 and 8 students in South Africa engaged with the notion of spatial scale in the Universe before, during and after a visit to an astronomy science centre. A limited amount of research has been conducted on this concept worldwide. Using a combination of concept maps, observations and interviews, results indicate that, despite contrary suggestions in the literature, students aged 13- to 15-years are able to improve their conceptions of size and distance from naïve and conflicting knowledge to a more scientific understanding after their visit. The findings also demonstrate, using a human constructivist framework, that students showed both weak and strong restructuring of knowledge. Experiences with size and distance also appeared to be important in the students' affective domain. The paper argues that a combination of related, themed experiences related to spatial scale can account for the improvement, and recommends that these and even more innovative activities should be explicitly promoted at science centres and in out-of-classroom activities.

AB  - Theme-based learning (TBL) refers to learning modes which adopt the following sequence: (a) finding the theme; (b) finding a focus of interest based on the theme; (c) finding materials based on the focus of interest; (d) integrating the materials to establish shared knowledge; (e) publishing and sharing the integrated knowledge. We have created an on-line system which supports the TBL mode to provide elementary school students with Web-based thematic learning. This study investigated the learning process of 40 fifth grade students in the natural science unit, "Stars and Sun", through the construction of conceptual maps supplemented with structured interviews with both instructors and students on the process and results of the Web-based thematic learning. The following conclusions were reached: (a) the Web-based thematic learning. system has positive effect on learners' concept learning; (b) the Web-based thematic learning first providing learners with a framework from which develops the related concepts, is a more stable learning mode; (c) the Web-based thematic learning system is suitable for students with different abilities. The middle achievement group of students is particularly suited to using a sharing and observation Web-based learning strategy. (Contains 6 tables and 11 figures.)

AB  - Let U and V be vector spaces. A mapping T : U [right arrow] V is linear if for each u[subscript 1], u[subscript 2] [is an element of] U and each scalar alpha; T(u[subscript 1] + u[subscript 2]) = T(u[subscript 1] + T(u[subscript 2]) and T(alpha u[subscript 1]) = alpha T(u[subscript 1]). We extend this mapping to the case when U and V are rhotrix vector spaces and present its properties. We also proved that a recently proposed method of converting a rhotrix to a special matrix called "coupled matrix" is a linear mapping.

AB  - This article examines the connections of linear algebra concepts in a first course at the undergraduate level. The theoretical underpinnings of this study are grounded in the constructivist perspective (including social constructivism), Vernaud's theory of conceptual fields and Pirie and Kieren's model for the growth of mathematical understanding. In addition to the existing techniques for analysing concept maps, two new techniques are developed for analysing qualitative data based on student-constructed concept maps: (1) temporal clumping of concepts and (2) the use of adjacency matrices of an undirected graph representation of the concept map. Findings suggest that students may find it more difficult to make connections between concepts like eigenvalues and eigenvectors and concepts from other parts of the conceptual field such as basis and dimension. In fact, eigenvalues and eigenvectors seemed to be the most disconnected concepts within all of the students' concept maps. In addition, the relationships between link types and certain clumps are suggested as well as directions for future study and curriculum design. (Contains 2 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - One of the earlier, more challenging concepts in linear algebra at university is that of basis. Students are often taught procedurally how to find a basis for a subspace using matrix manipulation, but may struggle with understanding the construct of basis, making further progress harder. We believe one reason for this is because students have major difficulties with concepts of span and linear independence which form the requirements for a set of vectors to form a basis. In this research we applied a theoretical framework based on Tall's three worlds of mathematics learning and action-process-object-schema (APOS) theory to the learning of the concept of basis by a group of second year university students. The results suggest that an emphasis on matrix processes may not help students understand the concept, and embodied, visual ideas that could be valuable were usually lacking.

AB  - The consideration of threshold concepts is offered in the context of biological education as a theoretical framework that may have utility in the teaching and learning of biology at all levels. Threshold concepts may provide a mechanism to explain the observed punctuated nature of conceptual change. This perspective raises the profile of periods of conceptual stasis from "failure to learn" to necessary periods within the normal pattern of student learning. Threshold concepts are seen as points where segmental/linear knowledge structures and cumulative/hierarchical knowledge structures are integrated, resulting in a transformation in understanding. "Evolution" and "dynamic transformation" are nominated as candidate threshold concepts within biology. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Within the field of education, there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of formative assessment and of structural knowledge. In an effort to fill needs in each of these areas, this article describes an innovative feedback strategy intended to improve students' structural knowledge. Twenty-four high school physics students were assessed using Pathfinder networks (PFnets) for their structural knowledge of a just-completed unit on work, energy, and power. As feedback, students were shown both their PFnet and a referent PFnet and were asked to reflect on the differences. In addition, misconceptions regarding the concept of "work" were identified in their PFnets and used to present individualized remedial exercises to each student. Following this feedback/remediation session, students' structural knowledge was again assessed. Results indicate that overall structural knowledge improved following feedback/remediation. In addition, structural knowledge of the concept "work" improved more than a control concept, indicating that feedback plus remediation had a larger effect than just feedback. We discuss the innovative features of the feedback strategy employed: the novel application of a "computer-based" assessment tool to provide "graphical" feedback aimed at improving "structural knowledge."

AB  - Mathematics educators and mathematics standards of curriculum have emphasised the importance of constructing the interconnectedness among mathematic concepts ("conceptual understanding") instead of only the ability to carry out standard procedures in an isolated fashion. Researchers have attempted to assess the knowledge networks in students' minds. A technique that has gained popular use in science education over the past three decades is concept mapping. This paper examines students' conceptual understanding about triangle concepts using concept maps, and an analysis of the maps using degree centralities derived from social network analysis has demonstrated new insights through this novel technique.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the most commonly used learning strategies of undergraduate students and how these strategies were related to their academic performance. Toward this purpose, a 60 item Likert scale was administered to a sample of 278 undergraduate students. The students were selected based on their cumulative grand-point-average as the most successful and the least successful five senior-year students from each majoring area in the faculties of arts, engineering, science, communication, and sports. The Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficient of the scale was 0,93. Results showed that successful students used more, varied, and better learning strategies than unsuccessful students. Female students were more effective in selecting and using appropriate strategies than male students. There were a variety of differences among fields of study; students of fine arts used the strategies least, while students of sports used them the most. The most preferred group of strategies was metacognitive strategies, whereas the least preferred group was organization strategies. The same pattern was found for the level of success, gender, and field of study. The results overall imply that certain strategies contribute to student performance more than other strategies, and majority of university students are aware of this situation. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - Cooperative learning has been sufficiently studied to be accepted as an effective method of education. Student reception of cooperative learning, and therefore the degree of its success in a given situation, will depend on the mode of delivery. New technology for delivering courses totally online challenges many aspects of traditional education, and is particularly difficult for cooperative learning that relies heavily on intense face-to-face communication among students. This study was conducted to compare cooperative learning in a traditional setting to that in hybrid and online settings. A model for delivering a cooperative learning experience has been developed utilizing concept maps within an upper division college course, History of Biology, as well as a hybrid version of the same course with the cooperative learning module run in a traditional class while the rest of the course remained online. A variation of this model is also being used to compare traditional and hybrid formats of introductory biology courses. The model for cooperative learning worked well for the majority of students. Based on attitudinal results, cooperative learning is equally successful regardless of the amount of face-to-face interaction. Students in the online version of this course were pleased with their cooperative learning experience despite the absence of this interaction. Many stated that it helped them gain a deeper understanding of the material. It also provided students with an environment conducive to peer tutoring and social interaction which is often missing from many online experiences. In each course, an increase in achievement was also indicated. This increase was significant for the hybrid and traditional setting. This model, however, was very challenging for the instructor. The hybrid version of the course was much more user-friendly than its fully online counterpart. This alternative method allows a relatively easy incorporation of cooperative learning for both students and instructor.

AB  - This research project investigates students' development of problem solving schemata while using strategies that facilitate the process of using solved examples to assist with a new problem (case reuse). Focus group learning interviews were used to explore students' perceptions and understanding of several problem solving strategies. Individual clinical interviews were conducted and quantitative examination data were collected to assess students' conceptual understanding, knowledge organization, and problem solving performance on a variety of problem tasks.    The study began with a short one-time treatment of two independent, research-based strategies chosen to facilitate case reuse. Exploration of students' perceptions and use of the strategies lead investigators to select one of the two strategies to be implemented over a full semester of focus group interviews. The strategy chosen was structure mapping.    Structure maps are defined as visual representations of quantities and their associations. They were created by experts to model the appropriate mental organization of knowledge elements for a given physical concept. Students were asked to use these maps as they were comfortable while problem solving. Data obtained from this phase of our study (Phase I) offered no evidence of improved problem solving schema. The 11 contact hour study was barely sufficient time for students to become comfortable using the maps.    A set of simpler strategies were selected for their more explicit facilitation of analogical reasoning, and were used together during two more semester long focus group treatments (Phase II and Phase III of this study). These strategies included the use of a step-by-step process aimed at reducing cognitive load associated with mathematical procedure, direct reflection of principles involved in a given set of problems, and the direct comparison of problem pairs designed to be void of surface similarities (similar objects or object orientations) and sharing physical principles (conservation of energy problems).    Overall, our results from the final two phases of this project indicate that these strategies are helpful in facilitating student ability to identify important information from given problems. The promising results from our study have significant implications for further research, curriculum material development, and instruction.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that adequate content knowledge is a necessary, but not sufficient, requirement for affective teaching. While legislation requests teachers to be "highly qualified" in a subject area, such as physics, many teachers are frequently asked to teach in an area when they are not certified through a teaching license to do so. This study uses mixed methods to examine the knowledge of beginning physics teachers. Through semi-structured interviews, classroom observations, and concept maps, the pedagogical content knowledge, subject matter knowledge, and practices of three groups of beginning secondary physics teachers were explored. Data were analyzed qualitatively using cases and quantitatively using descriptive statistics and t-tests, the results of which were combined during the interpretation phase of the research process. The study indicated that, over the first two years of teaching, the in-field group of teachers showed stronger physics content knowledge, a consideration for student difficulties with physics topics, and a positive shift in pedagogical content knowledge impacted by working with students, as compared to the rest of the teachers in the study. This research has implications in the development of secondary physics teachers and in the field of physics education research. Specifically, this research has implications in the physics content support for beginning secondary science teachers, the novice/expert research in physics education research, and the pedagogical preparation of undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty in physics.

AB  - Although young children are major audiences of science museums, limited evidence exists documenting changes in children's knowledge in these settings due in part to the limited number of valid and reliable assessment tools available for use with this population. The purposes of this study were to develop and validate a concept mapping assessment tool and to use this tool to document the butterfly-related knowledge of young children on unguided family visits to a live butterfly exhibit at a natural history museum. In this study, forty-two children visited the live butterfly exhibit with their families on unguided tours and completed pre- and post-visit concept mapping tasks. During pre- and post-visit mapping sessions, children created and revised concept maps about butterflies using a set of eight butterfly-related concept pictures and provided verbal explanations for each picture pair in their concept maps.    Three raters used three different scoring systems designed for use in this study to evaluate the scientific accuracy of the children's pre- and post-visit maps, including the picture pairs and verbal explanations. Quantitative analyses of the scores indicate that the raters used the three scoring systems with a moderate to high level of consistency. The results also indicate that children significantly increased their butterfly-related knowledge in the live butterfly exhibit regardless of recent prior experience with the exhibit.    Qualitative analyses of children's verbal explanations indicate that children possessed butterfly-related knowledge related to: the needs of butterflies, the life cycle of butterflies, the ecology of butterflies and other insects, the diversity and classification of butterflies and other insects, the threats to and conservation of butterflies, and the social and maternal behavior of butterflies. Although children with different levels of exhibit experience showed similarly high levels of prior and subsequent knowledge, the types of understandings they communicated in their verbal explanations differed somewhat. Surprisingly, children without recent prior exhibit experience showed greater understanding in more areas of butterfly-related knowledge than children with recent prior exhibit experience. The results of this study have implications for the field of science education in general and the field of informal science education in particular.

AB  - This research attempted to bridge the gap between cognitive psychology and educational measurement (Mislevy, 2008; Leighton & Gierl, 2007; Nichols, 1994; Messick, 1989; Snow & Lohman, 1989) by using cognitive theories from working memory (Baddeley, 1986; Miyake & Shah, 1999; Grimley & Banner, 2008), multimedia learning (Mayer, 2001), and cognitive load (Chandler and Sweller, 1991, 1992; Cerpa, Chandler, & Sweller, 1996) to identify potential design weaknesses of traditional select-and-fill-in (SAFI) concept map assessment and then to guide the design of the new and improved multiple-choice concept map (MCCM) assessment method.    The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of (1) the type of the list of concepts or relations and (2) the spatial placement of the selection list on the examinee's overall mental effort. Using a 2x2 Factorial MANCOVA, with prior knowledge as the covariate, the participants were compared on the length of time to complete the assessment and on examinee's rating of personal mental effort exerted during the assessment. A Simple Planned Comparison was conducted to evaluate estimated mean differences between the primary group of interest (MCCM-integrated Group 4) and each of the other three groups. Of additional interest were differences among the four different groups on the examinees' attitudes and impressions toward their respective assessment method; these data provided more insight into the quality of design for each treatment group.    The type of List/Map had a significant main effect on the overall mental effort/strain or the linear combination of time on task and mental effort rating scores. More specifically, however, the test of between-subjects effects indicated that the type of list/map had a statistically significant effect on the time to complete the assessment, but not on the examinees' mental effort ratings. In other words, participants who received the MCCM assessments (which used the MCL)completed the assessment task significantly faster but did not rate higher or lower on personal mental effort than the participants who received the traditional SAFI concept map assessments.    The spatial placement of the selection list (integrated and non-integrated) did not have a statistically significant main effect on the linear combination of time on task and mental effort rating scores. The test of between-subjects effects indicated that the spatial placement of the selection list (integrated versus non-integrated) did not have a statistically significant effect on the time to complete the assessment or on the examinees' exerted mental effort. In other words, participants who received who received the integrated lists did not complete the assessment task faster and did not rate themselves lower on personal mental effort than the participants who received non-integrated selection list.    The estimated mean time on task of the primary group of interest (MCCM-integrated Group 4) was significantly shorter than that of both SAFI groups (integrated and non-integrated), but was not significantly shorter when compared to the time on task of the MCCM-non-integrated Group 3. There were no significant differences on mental effort ratings between MCCM-integrated Group 4 and either of the other three groups.    The participant responses to the Attitudes and Impressions Questionnaire indicated a general preference for the MCCM over the more traditional SAFI map and, in some cases, a slight preference of MCCM-integrated over MCCM-non-integrated.    The multiple-choice concept map (MCCM) is a new interactive computer-based assessment method that bridges well-documented research findings from cognitive science and psychometrics and has the potential to be an external knowledge representation with much-desired characteristics of being valid, efficient, and explicit (Mislevy, Behrens, Bennett, DeMark, Frezzo, Levy, Robinson, Rutstein, Stanley, Winters, & Shute, 2007) when assessing students' knowledge structures or schema-based knowledge (Pellegrino, Chudowsky, & Glasser, editors, 2001; NAEP, 2008).

AB  - Over the past several years, the authors have been developing an instructional technology, called Teachable Agents (TA), which draws on the social metaphor of teaching to help students learn. Students teach a computer character, their "agent," by creating a concept map of nodes connected by qualitative causal links. The authors hypothesize that the metaphor of teaching allows students to use a well-known, and potentially productive, schema for organizing their interactions and for interpreting feedback (for reviews of the benefits of learning-by-teaching, see Annis, 1983; Biswas et al., 2005; Renkl, 1995; Roscoe & Chi, 2008). The authors have also conducted studies to examine the nature of the learning benefits from TA. Their studies on the effectiveness on TA have been, in the past, of relatively short duration, used specially designed content, and were taught under the strict edicts of the research designs. The authors wanted to see how the technology would fare in the more complex ecology of regular instruction, when teachers could integrate TA as they chose, into the flow of their normal curriculum over a sustained period of time. Of particular interest were 1) whether they could replicate their earlier PFL (Preparation for Future Learning) results showing that learning benefits persisted for students, "even when no longer supported by the technology"; 2) whether gains would emerge on the standard, basic-value assessments, in addition to their own added-value assessments that focused on the TA's strength of promoting causal reasoning; and 3) whether the learning benefits would be associated with particular student behaviors in the TA system. A small, local school district agreed to use the TA technology as added-value instruction to complement their regular science curriculum. The district had adopted the Full Option Science System (FOSS), developed by the Lawrence Hall of Science (www.lhsfoss.org). FOSS kits come complete with teacher guides, textbooks, videos, hands-on activities, worksheets, and assessments. The study involved six teachers and 134 5th-grade students (104 with permission to analyze their data). Teachable Agents weathered its first test in the complexity of the real world, where teachers chose how to use the software for several months as an added-value to their normal instruction. Students exhibited a deeper causal understanding of the FOSS material, as measured by the added-value tests and the "Why" questions in FOSS's own basic-value assessments. The TA activities did not displace basic learning from the FOSS kit. Moreover, the degree to which students used the map editing and feedback features correlated with learning, even after controlling for prior achievement. And finally, perhaps the most exciting result is that experience with TAs supported students' future learning of new content, even when they no longer used the software. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - Technology offers promising opportunities for creating new types of classroom learning environments. This paper describes three technology models used by teacher education interns: electronic portfolios, negotiative concept mapping, cognote-supported electronic discussions. As implemented in the current study, these models invoke graduated attributes of knowledge building and as such serve as a useful continuum of examples of the potential of technology to assist in promoting progressive knowledge construction. A description of the models is followed by a discussion of the relationship of these classrooms to Knowledge-Building principles. (Contains 2 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - This paper discusses the character and challenges inherent in the graphical portrayal of features in subsurface mapping. Subsurface structures are, by their nature, hidden and must be mapped based on drilling and/or geophysical data. Efficient use of graphical techniques is central to effectively communicating the results of expensive exploration programs and intensive data interpretation. Data sets used in subsurface mapping tend to be sparse, resulting in generalization of subsurface structures. Control of subsurface structure is materially influenced by faulting or other structures, and the preparation of subsurface data for mapping must reflect this control. The graphical techniques involved in this work require use of a variety of graphics carefully designed to assist the map user in visualizing the subsurface. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - Background: This study deals with the application of concept mapping to the teaching and learning of a science topic with secondary school students in Germany. Purpose: The main research questions were: (1) Do different teaching approaches affect concept map structure or students' learning success? (2) Is the structure of concept maps influenced by gender? (3) Is the concept map structure a reliable indicator of students' learning success? Sample: One hundred and forty-nine high-achieving 5th-grade students from four German secondary schools participated in the study. The average age of participants was 10.5 years. Gender distribution was balanced. Students produced concept maps working in small, single-sex groups. Design and methods: There were two teaching approaches used: one based upon teacher-centred instruction and one consisting of student-centred learning. Both were followed by a concept-mapping phase. Student groups experienced either one or the other teaching approach. Concept map structures were analysed using of the method of Kinchin, Hay and Adams. We defined three different possible types of concept map structure: spokes, chains and nets. Furthermore, for assessing a student's short- and longer-term learning success, we constructed a multiple-choice knowledge test applied in a pre-, post-, retention-test design. Parametric tests, such as MANOVA, one-way ANOVA and t-tests were used to identify any differences in gender, teaching approach, number of nets per concept map and their interactions. Results: Type of teaching approach had an effect on concept map structure but not on students' longer-term learning success. Students of the teacher-centred approach produced more net structures than those students who participated in the hands-on instruction. Subsequent analyses showed in total more net structures for female groups. The interaction of gender and number of nets per concept map showed a significant effect on students' longer-term learning success. Conclusion: The study suggests that Kinchin's classification scheme for assessing concept map quality may be a good indicator of students' learning success when applied in combination with a knowledge test.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether there was a quantifiable improvement in learning outcomes by integrating course materials in a 4-year baccalaureate program, utilizing a knowledge repository with a conceptual map that spans a discipline. Two new models were developed to provide the framework for this knowledge repository. A design artifact, Constructivist Unifying Baccalaureate Epistemology (CUBE), was developed and tested and incorporates these models. This CUBE artifact incorporates a Semantic Web ontology and a W3C Resource Description Framework to create a concept space that offers a unified view of the discipline. The Knowledge Repository was modeled as an organic structure with the ability to evolve over time by incorporating a ranking/voting feature which enables students and faculty to add content to the knowledge base and collectively evaluate the relative weights of conceptual threads. Conceptual Clustering was used to create a concept map for traversing the Knowledge Repository. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the Knowledge Repository, a triangulated research approach was used, which cross checked results with multiple data sources and utilized qualitative and quantitative methods to validate the test instruments. The analyses included: focus groups, semistructured interviews, a questionnaire, and a quantitative exam that measured knowledge spanning multiple courses. Four classes participated during two semesters with four faculty members, using control and treatment groups. The research contrasted conventional single course instruction "versus" an Integrated Knowledge Repository (IKR) approach to learning. There was an average increase of 25 points in scores on a comprehensive exam for students who used the Knowledge Repository. The results supported our main hypothesis, that "Students utilizing the IKR will develop a more complex understanding of the interconnected nature of the materials linking a discipline than those students who take conventional single topic courses".

AB  - We used four different methods to determine the best means of assessing over 200 preservice elementary teachers' growth in knowledge of models and their use in K-8 classrooms while participating in the Science Capstone course that focused on the unifying themes of models in science. Each assessment method probed a different aspect of models (from growth in scientific use to need for greater emphasis on the role and use of models) and each used a different method of gathering student responses (Likert-type responses to concept maps). We determined that growth in student knowledge was demonstrated by all instruments, but some instruments were more useful than others for determining preservice elementary teachers' prior knowledge as well as growth in knowledge of models necessary for K-8 teachers.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate whether a chemistry laboratory course called "Laboratory Experiments in Science Education" based on constructivist instruction accompanied with concept mapping enhanced pre-service chemistry teachers' conceptual understanding. Data were collected from five pre-service chemistry teachers at a university in Ankara by means of a concept test and semi-structured interviews. Results showed that pre-service teachers had some alternative conceptions about chemistry topics. Moreover, using constructivist instruction accompanied with concept maps as an instructional tool was effective to promote conceptual understanding. Participants thought that concept maps were useful especially in recognizing the relation between different chemistry concepts.

AB  - In this article, we describe an innovative capstone course for preservice K-8 teachers integrating action research and a unifying theme in science (AAAS in Science for all Americans. Oxford University Press, New York, 1989; NRC in National science education standards. National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 1996). The goals of the capstone course are to increase student knowledge of the unifying theme, improve written communication skills, and introduce students to educational research. We provide evidence that each of these goals is met. Student growth in theme knowledge is demonstrated through concept maps, questionnaires, and previously reported assessments. Improved writing ability is demonstrated using the spelling and grammar checking feature of Microsoft Word. The analysis of action research reports demonstrates that students are able to connect their action research project results to previous research.

AB  - Students' difficulties with accurately conceptualizing the relationships among the Earth, Moon, and Sun are well documented. Any teacher who has seen the film "A Private Universe" (Schneps and Sadler 1988) will remember the challenge the interviewees experienced when trying to explain their understanding of this phenomenon. This paper describes a strategy to help students develop a model of the Earth/Moon relationship that is correct both in terms of the scale sizes and the distances between them and extends previous work present in "Science Scope" (see Wallace, Dickerson, and Hopkins 2007: Riddle 2006a).

AB  - This study assessed the influence of training in, and use of, metacognitive strategies on the development of prospective elementary teachers' views of nature of science (NOS). Participants were 49 students (92% female) enrolled in two sections of an elementary science methods course. The sections were randomly assigned to an intervention group and a comparison group. Students in both groups were engaged with explicit-reflective NOS instruction, which focused on the empirical, tentative, theory-driven, inferential, and creative NOS. Additionally, students in the intervention group received instruction in, and used, three metacognitive strategies during their engagement with thinking about NOS. The Views of Nature of Science Questionnaire--Form C and the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory were respectively used to assess participants' views of NOS and metacognitive awareness at the beginning and conclusion of the study. Data analyses indicated that significantly more students in the intervention group explicated more informed views of the target aspects of NOS. Moreover, these substantial changes were coupled with significantly increased Metacognitive Awareness Inventory scores for the intervention group participants. The results point to a relationship between improved metacognitive awareness and the development of informed understandings of NOS. (Contains 7 tables.)

AB  - As part of a math-science partnership, a university mathematics educator and ten elementary school teachers developed a novel approach to mathematical problem solving derived from research on reading and writing pedagogy. Specifically, research indicates that students who use graphic organizers to arrange their ideas improve their comprehension and communication skills. A graphic organizer is a visual representation of content classification (mind mapping), concept development (flowcharts), and relationship comparisons (Venn diagrams). This article demonstrates the benefits of using modified graphic organizers with ten classes of third- through fifth-grade mathematics students. The author also includes an activity sheet.

AB  - Comments on a article by Dewsbury (February-March 2009) in which he stated, "Darwin provided a viable mechanism for evolutionary change, natural selection" (p. 67). Although this view is consistent with the modern synthesis, the author argues that (a) the natural selection "mechanism" provided by Darwin was not initially accepted by scientists because (b) natural selection is a functional explanation, and functional explanations are always incomplete because they describe how things work but not why they work; that is, they lack mechanism information. This explanatory deficiency led to what Bowler (1983), uncited by Dewsbury (2009), described (in a book of the same name) as "The eclipse of Darwinism," the initial rejection of natural selection by most scientists. The importance of the distinction the author is making between functional explanations and mechanism information for the future of psychology is that efforts to advance psychological science by clarifying causal mechanisms must first understand how mechanism explanations differ from functional explanations.

AB  - This article presents a critical review and analysis of key studies that have been done in science education and other areas on the effects and effectiveness of using diagrams, graphs, photographs, illustrations, and concept maps as "adjunct visual aids" in the learning of scientific-technical content. It also summarizes and reviews those studies that have students draw diagrams, graphs, maps, and charts to express their understandings of the concepts and relationships that are present in the text they read or/and empirical data provided (i.e., student-generated "adjunct visual productions"). In general, the research and theory on instructional aids is fragmented and somewhat unsystematic with several flaws and a number of key uncontrolled variables, which actually suppress and mask effects in the studies that have been done. The findings of these studies are compared to relevant literature and empirical research and findings in the areas of cognitive psychology, computer science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence that help to clarify many of the inconsistencies, contradictions, and lack of effects found for visual (e.g., diagrams and graphs) instructional aids in the science education literature currently and in the past 20 years. A model and a set of criteria and goals for improving research in this area is then described, as visuals are a first step in the process of learning formal (scientific) models, which are most often visually represented. Understanding how students learn formal models is one the outstanding research challenges in the next 20 years, both within and outside of science education.

AB  - This study investigated how well 74 6th-grade science students represented text structures from a 900-word textbook chapter on soil conservation, given a concept map template with four superordinate terms and 24 unsorted concepts. Findings suggest students were more successful at classifying pre-selected terms under given superordinate categories than they were at fully identifying relevant concept sets and articulating three different relationship types between terms. No significant differences were noted in the mapping performance of students at different reading levels. About two-third of students indicated they enjoyed concept mapping and would prefer to both read and map rather than just read without mapping. Students also expressed a strong preference for mapping in pairs or small groups compared to mapping alone. Multiple recommendations are provided for improving the relational thinking of students tasked with concept mapping expository science texts, including bridging to more open-ended maps, embedding mapping in longer-term inquiry projects, and leveraging collaborative and tool-based scaffolds.

AB  - Learning how the periodic table has developed over time can provide an important foundation for students' future science learning, as they begin to explore the explanatory power of other models in science. In this activity, students are given the opportunity to investigate the generation of the modern periodic table, through a process of creating their own plausible periodic tables. In addition, students learn about Mendeleev's contribution and the nature of science through inquiry-based instruction. (Contains 6 figures and 5 resources.)

AB  - Concept mapping is a technique that paves the way to represent knowledge schematically. In this research, concept mapping was used as an assessment method on the impulse-momentum topic. The purpose of this study was to determine teacher candidates' knowledge about understanding of the concepts of impulse and momentum by comparing and contrasting two different methods; namely, students' concept maps and an achievement test. The mean of teacher candidates' concept map scores are extremely low when compared with the scores of the achievement test. In addition, it was seen that although a great number of concepts were written down, not many relationships were established between these concepts. There is a weak correlation between the achievement test and the concept map scores since concept maps assess the students' knowledge from a conceptual perspective while the achievement tests measure the level of students' knowledge on the topic and his/her ability to apply this knowledge on different occasions.

AB  - In this paper, the authors examine an algebra-based physics course designed for preservice teachers and explore how the course integrated two pedagogical strategies to bridge the gap between inquiry-learning experiences and the teachers' nature of science (NOS) understandings. The results of this research show that the explicit, reflective process allowed participants to examine their NOS understandings, which thereby fostered changes in their understanding.

AB  - Students in a Landscape Architecture Design 1 course (N = 25) at a research university in the southern US developed design solutions implementing geologic time for an informal education site. Those students who employed abstract metaphors for their designs (n = 8) were more successful than students who proceeded with a linear design construct. Pre- and posttest assessments using the Petrified Wood Survey and student-constructed timelines suggested that 1) 75% geoscience content knowledge is needed for successful design, and 2) relative understanding of Earth events and the barrenness of early Earth's landscape is also prerequisite for successful design implementation. Most revealing of students' cognitive processes were the concept statements and concept maps produced during the project. The concept statement forced students to address the project's requirements, take a position with their concept development of abstract metaphorical representation, and proceed with a final design solution. It appears that concept statements with accompanying concept maps facilitate student cognition by forcing student comprehension and application of geoscience content knowledge. We suggest that an inclusion of concept statements when teaching application of a complex Earth system or process may facilitate students' geoscience cognition in design and/or informal educational settings.

AB  - Correlation is an essential concept in statistics; however, students may hold misconceptions about correlation, even after receiving instruction. This study aimed to elucidate (1) the misconceptions held by senior high school students about correlation, using the tool of concept mapping along with interviewing, (2) the possible causes of these misconceptions, and (3) the effectiveness, advantages, and limitations of the adopted concept mapping using an interviewing technique for identifying student misconceptions. Twenty-five grade-12 students who had received tuition on correlation were the subjects of this study. Concept mapping through interviewing was used to collect and analyze data in order to identify the subjects' misconceptions, and their possible causes. The major study results are as follows. (1) Seven misconceptions about correlation were detected. Of these seven misconceptions, five were newly discovered by this study, while the other two are similar to those found by previous studies. Each of the seven misconceptions was held by 20-68% of the subjects, showing their prevalence and significance. (2) Four major factors related to the development of misconceptions about correlation were identified: learning materials, language, daily-life experiences, and existing mathematical concepts. (3) The concept mapping through the interviewing technique adopted in this study was effective in detecting misconceptions about statistics, especially in revealing new misconceptions, and it was also helpful in exploring their possible causes. However, tremendous effort and the time consumed are the major limitations of this technique. (4) The paper concluded by providing some recommendations for researchers and educators.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of metaconceptual teaching interventions on students' understanding of force and motion concepts. A multimethod research design including quasi-experimental design and case study designs was employed to compare the effect of the metaconceptual activities and traditional instruction and investigate students' reactions to metaconceptual teaching interventions. The participants (45 high school students in the USA) were enrolled in one of the two physics classes instructed by the same science teacher. In the experimental group, students' engagement in metaconceptual knowledge and processes was facilitated through various instructional activities, including poster drawing, journal writing, group debate, concept mapping, and class and group discussions. These activities were intended to facilitate students' engagement in (a) becoming aware of their existing and past conceptions, associated beliefs, everyday experiences, and contextual differences, (b) monitoring their understanding of the new conception, the changes in ideas, and the consistency between existing and new conceptions, and (c) evaluating the relative ability of competing conceptions to explain a physical phenomenon. In the comparison group, the same content knowledge was explained by the teacher along with the use of laboratory experiments, demonstrations, and quantitative problem solving. Students' reactions to the designed instructional activities indicated that metaconceptual teaching interventions were successful in facilitating students' engagement in several types of metaconceptual functioning. The results showed that students in the experimental group had significantly better conceptual understanding than their counterparts in the comparison group and this positive impact remained after a period of 9 weeks.

AB  - Although most instructors would like to believe that their students fully understand every biological concept explained in class, this is often not the case. Gary Wisehart, chair and professor of biology at San Diego City College, knows this from firsthand experience. "Students get very good at telling you what you want to hear," he says, "so it is important to assess the real impact you are having on students' understanding." To do that, Wisehart has been using concept inventories, diagnostic tools designed specifically to uncover lingering misconceptions. This article talks about concept inventory in natural selection (CINS) and discusses how educators are using this tool to correct students' biology misconceptions.

AB  - Introduction: This paper constitutes part of a series of studies intended to establish "Literature and Art Informatics". The paper describes the conceptual background of multiple correspondence analysis and its use in visualizing conceptual spaces to describe the values that motivate the use of information technology by literary authors. An examination of artistic use of technology builds on past work applying multiple correspondence analysis to the study of art and literature that did not specifically look at technology use. Method: The methods described in this paper are predominantly quantitative and incorporate data from interviews conducted with literary authors. The paper takes an intermediate approach, mediating between pure methodological papers on one hand, and, on the other hand, topical papers that provide a highly abbreviated description of the method described here. Analysis: The paper includes both quantitative analysis, which describes the conceptual background for using and interpreting multiple correspondence analysis, as well as qualitative analysis of the use of the technique in the context of a study of information technology use by literary authors. The analysis centres on the conceptual background of the technique and how it can provide useful interpretative tools for "Literature and Art Informatics". Results: Multiple correspondence analysis allowed the construction of conceptual spaces that aided interpretation of technology use by literary authors. Its use reinforced the qualitative findings from an earlier article that writers who make higher use of technology do so in a way that reflects an intensification of the avant-garde-ism that typifies American literary writing. Conclusions: Multiple correspondence analysis provides useful interpretative tools that can further our understanding of the conceptual context in which information technology use by literary authors occurs.

AB  - This study investigates Turkish students' knowledge structure coherence in physics. In particular, this study investigates the conflicting findings reported in Ioannides and Vosniadou's [Ioannides and Vosniadou [2002] "Cognitive Science Quarterly," 2, 5-61] and diSessa, Gillespie, and Esterly's [diSessa et al. [2004] "Cognitive Science," 28, 843-900] studies about students' understandings of force. Ioannides and Vosniadou's study of four different age levels of students in Greece demonstrated broad consistency in students' understandings of force. diSessa and colleagues' quasi-replication in the United States demonstrated conflicting results supporting a more fragmented elemental perspective on students' knowledge structure coherence. The current study investigates these conflicting findings by studying students in a third country using the analytic methods from both studies to clarify the debate over knowledge structure coherence. The levels of consistency demonstrated by students in the current study are somewhat higher than the levels reported by diSessa, Gillespie, and Esterly according to both coding schemes, but are closer overall to the levels reported by diSessa, Gillespie, and Esterly than to the levels reported by Ioannides and Vosniadou. In addition, closer inspection of students' explanations suggests that students' explanations may code as consistent according to the coding schemes for a particular force meaning category but not actually represent a coherent understanding of that force meaning. These results therefore more closely support fragmented elemental perspectives on knowledge structure coherence. The results, however, demonstrate important systematicities in students' thinking and support the possibility that differences between the student populations in the countries of the original studies contributed to the differences in findings of the original studies.

AB  - This research is concerned with preservice teacher understanding of six earth and space science concepts that are often taught in elementary school: the reason for seasons, phases of the moon, why the wind blows, the rock cycle, soil formation, and earthquakes. Specifically, this study examines the effect of readings, hands-on learning stations, and concept mapping in improving conceptual understanding. Undergraduates in two sections of a science methods course (N=52) completed an open-ended survey, giving explanations about the above concepts three times: as a pretest and twice as posttests after various instructional interventions. The answers, scored with a three point rubric, indicated that the preservice teachers initially had many misconceptions (alternative conceptions). A two way ANOVA with repeated measures analysis (pretest/posttest) demonstrated that readings and learning stations are both successful in building preservice teacher's understanding and that benefits from the hands-on learning stations approached statistical significance. Concept mapping had an additive effect in building understanding, as evident on the second posttest. The findings suggest useful strategies for university science instructors to use in clarifying science concepts while modeling activities teachers can use in their own classrooms.

AB  - Our paper presents an in-service primary school teachers' training program which is based on the idea that the history of science can play a vital role in promoting the learning of physics. This training program has been developed in the context of Comenius 2.1 which is a European Union program. This program that we have developed in the University of Athens is based on socioconstructivist and sociocultural learning principles with the intention of helping teachers to appropriate the basic knowledge on the issue of falling bodies. Moreover, it has the aim to make explicit through the exploitation of authentic historical science events, on the above topic (Aristotle's, Galileo's and Newton's theories on falling bodies) the Nature of Science (NoS), the Nature of Learning (NoL) and the Nature of Teaching (NoT). During the implementation of the program we have used a variety of teaching strategies (e.g. group work, making of posters, making of concept maps, simulations) that utilize historical scientific materials on the issue of falling bodies.

AB  - This paper discusses on the mapping of the English preposition "at" in the context of forward and backward translation in temporal domain based on the temporal sense of "at" of the English preposition and its extension to different lexical positions in the Arabic language. This can be explained in the way the conceptual mapping sense is used to an underlying concept and finding its lexical meaning in the target language. The forward and backward translation tests are suggested in order to identify the concept of mapping of the three different groups, using the temporal sense, in three semantic mapping categories (SDM, ZDM and DDM).

AB  - This paper presents a study carried out at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU with the aim of evaluating the CM-ED (concept map editor) with social education students. Concept mapping is a widely accepted technique that promotes meaningful learning. Graphically representing concepts of the learning domain and relationships between them helps students integrate new knowledge into their current cognitive structure. Due to the flexibility of computer-aided drawing graphs, several concept mapping tools have been developed and their use has been studied over the last few years. CM-ED is a multilingual and multimedia software program designed for drawing concept maps. Until recently, CM-ED had been mainly used and evaluated in computer science university degree. This paper represents a qualitative step in the evaluation of CM-ED: from technical students to students of more theoretical fields. The main characteristics of the CM-ED editor and the carried out study are presented in this paper. (Contains 5 tables and 9 figures.)

AB  - The researchers investigated the comparative effects of individually-constructed and collaboratively-constructed computer-based concept mapping on middle school science concept learning. One hundred and sixty one students completed the entire study. Using prior science performance scores to assure equivalence of student achievement across groups, students were assigned to three groups: a self-selected study strategy group, an individual-concept mapping group, and a collaborative pairs--concept mapping group. Collaboratively and individually-constructing computer-based concept maps had equally positive effects on seventh grade middle school science concept learning as measured on a comprehension test. However, the students who collaboratively constructed concept maps created significantly higher quality concept maps than those who individually constructed concept maps indicating deeper conceptual understanding.

AB  - The research reported here consists of the introduction of an intervention based on a series of laboratory activities combined with concept mapping. The purpose of this intervention was to enhance student understanding of acid-base chemistry for tenth grade students' from two classes in a Turkish high school. An additional aim was to enhance student attitude toward chemistry. In the research design, two cohorts of students were compared; those from the intervention group (N = 31) and a second group (N = 28) who were taught in a more traditional manner. Student understanding of acid-base chemistry was evaluated with a pretest/posttest research design using a purpose-designed instrument, the "Concept Achievement Test" (CAT) consisting of 25 items, 15 multiple choice and ten multiple choice with explanation. Alternative conceptions identified in the pretest were incorporated into the intervention, which thereby sought to move students toward views more in accord with scientific views for the concepts. Statistical tests indicate the instrument is reliable (with an alpha reliability of 0.81) and the analysis of the findings revealed statistically significant differences between the intervention and traditional groups with respect to conceptual understanding. Examination of student explanations and analyses of semi-structured interviews conducted with selected students suggest that the main influence was the laboratory activities. Analysis of the findings in the context of relevant literature that concept mapping in conjunction with laboratory activities is more enjoyable, helps student link concepts, and reduces their alternative conceptions.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explain prospective science and technology teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) about the cell. Lesson preparation, laboratory plan, interview with teacher candidates, and concept mapping were used to collect the data for prospective teacher's PCK. The study was conducted with six prospective science and technology teachers in the spring of 2006-2007 in Pamukkale University-Turkey. We aimed to identify the content and structure of the PCK for a topic on cell, describing the PCK in terms of relations between four different aspects: Knowledge about science and technology curriculum, belief about subject matter knowledge, knowledge about students' understanding; knowledge about assessment of students. According to the result of the study, pre-service teacher's knowledge inaccurate special teaching methods, they used a teacher-centered approach, and also they have a high belief of subject matter knowledge. Based on the result of this study, which were discussed in the light of national and international literature, we have suggestions for further researchers, curriculum developers, and science and technological teacher educators.

AB  - The widespread deployment and use of Information Technologies (IT) has paved the way for change in many fields of our societies. The Internet, mobile computing, social networks and many other advances in human communications have become essential to promote and boost education, technology and industry. On the education side, the new challenges related with the integration of IT technologies into all aspects of learning require revising the traditional educational paradigms that have prevailed for the last centuries. Additionally, the globalization of education and student mobility requirements are favoring a fluid interchange of tools, methodologies and evaluation strategies, which promote innovation at an accelerated pace. Curricular revisions are also taking place to achieve a more specialized education that is able to respond to the society's requirements in terms of professional training. In this process, guaranteeing quality has also become a critical issue. On the industrial and technological side, the focus on ecological developments is essential to achieve a sustainable degree of prosperity, and all efforts to promote greener societies are welcome.

AB  - Recent years have seen a shift in focus from assessment of learning to assessment for learning and the emergence of alternative assessment methods. However, the reliability and validity of these methods as assessment tools are still questionable. In this article, we investigated the predictive validity of measures of the Pathfinder Scaling Algorithm (PSA), a concept mapping assessment utility, using the referent-free and referent-based approaches on programming performance of a group of secondary school students. Results suggest that the predictive validity of both approaches was more or less the same. Among the three similarity measures applied for the referent-based approach, PRX appeared to be the most predictive one whereas PFC and GTD were similar in terms of predictive power. The correlations between the referent-free measure C and the three previously mentioned referent-based measures with the programming performance measures were not as strong as reported in the literature. In the light of these results, we argue that there is a need to reform assessment in programming education. (Contains 2 figures and 5 tables.)

AB  - This paper summarizes the content and results of a workshop about the teaching of evolution presented to public middle school and high school science teachers by individuals involved both in university education and the professional development of teachers. The goals of the workshop were to: (1) provide teachers with knowledge and resources to more effectively teach evolutionary theory, (2) increase teacher awareness of legal and cognitive issues associated with the teaching and learning of evolution, (3) address teacher misconceptions about evolutionary theory, (4) assess teachers' acceptance of evolutionary theory, and (5) make inferences about the preparedness of Arizona's public school students for a rigorous university life science curriculum that includes evolutionary biology. Participating teachers created concept maps about evolutionary theory, completed the Measure of Acceptance of the Theory of Evolution (MATE) survey at the beginning and end of the workshop, and responded to a survey the week following the workshop. The results of these measures indicate that some Arizona science teachers have misconceptions about evolutionary theory that may be passed on to their students, and these misconceptions, if not corrected, must be addressed in introductory-level science courses at the university level. Based on feedback from the follow-up survey, different teachers with varying levels of acceptance of evolution are all keen to learn from university educators and attend professional development workshops. Such workshops--and engagement between secondary and tertiary educators - can clearly have an effect on the conceptions of both teachers and students, and thus on the acceptance of evolution generally. We therefore strongly encourage the involvement of university educators in science education outreach that addresses evolutionary theory.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of instructional materials for the subject of classification of matter as solids, liquids and gases that were developed using a holistic instructional design model on student achievement. In the study a pre-test/post-test with control group experimental design was used. The study was conducted in the 2004-2005 school year using a sample of 120 students in the 7th grade (Experimental group 1=30, Experimental group 2=30, Control group 1=30, and Control group 2=30). At the beginning of the study a prior knowledge test, science attitude scale and Multiple Intelligence Fields Determination Scale were completed by the students. At the end of the study an achievement determination questionnaire was completed by the students in the experimental and control groups. Instructional material including student worksheets, student practice questions and a teacher guide were prepared by the researchers on the Freehand MXa program. In teaching the subject to the experimental groups, a holistic instructional approach was used that combined reliance on multiple intelligence theory, a constructivist approach, deliberate use of analogies and an emphasis on science process skills. In addition, concept maps and an animation were used. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance, Cohen's size effect, and the Scheffe Test with the SPSS 11.00 program at the .05 significance level. At the beginning of the study, it was found that while there was no statistically significant difference between the students of the experimental and control groups, at the end of the study levels of achievement of the students on this subject in the two experimental groups were higher than both control groups.

AB  - This qualitative study examines first-year college students' online search habits in order to identify patterns in millennials' mental models of information retrieval. The study employed a combination of modified contextual inquiry and concept mapping methodologies to elicit students' mental models. The researcher confirmed previously observed millennial behavior including preference for searching rather than browsing and hypertext reading. The study found three basic types of mental models; those with a network view conducted more searches overall and more complex (Boolean and topic + focus) searches. However, none of the participants demonstrated strong mental models that increased their effectiveness in searching.

AB  - This dissertation explores the formal theologies and organizational readiness for change with a view towards adopting missional prototypes for theological education across a school's (system's) tradition, curriculum, and structure. The research assessed five theological schools in the United States through an exploratory, action-oriented, mixed-model methodology that sought to empower schools to understand the disadvantages of current functional theologies and organizational archetypes in order to imagine missional prototypes for theological education. Primary field-tested instruments for evaluation included--a "qualitative" "Missional School Discovery Interview" and a "quantitative" "Missional School Discovery Online Survey." The project relied heavily on theological and social science frameworks, including missional church theology, American evangelicalism, the theological education debate, and postmodern institutional, archetype, and radical change theories. The outcome of this project is a theological and organizational assessment of five schools and twelve missional prototypes across the five systems, as well as further avenues for research in theological education.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of questioning "during" a read-aloud and questioning "after" a read-aloud, using science-related informational tradebooks with first-and second-graders. Three thematically-related tradebooks were used, each portraying a scientist involved in authentic investigation. Students in two first/second grade classrooms were engaged in three read-aloud sessions. One group was engaged in discussion of text ideas during reading, while the other group engaged in discussion only at the conclusion of the read-alouds. After-story posttest results revealed minimal differences in scores between groups. However, students in the during-reading group demonstrated statistically significant differences in their pretest/posttest gain scores. This suggests that the cumulative effect of exposing students to multiple texts focusing on the work scientists do did affect students' building a robust representation of text ideas. Furthermore, these results suggest that pairing thematically-related texts with discussion during the read-aloud, cuing students to important ideas and encouraging text-to-text connections as they are encountered, was more beneficial than engaging students in similar discussion after reading.

AB  - The authors address the role of computer support for building conceptual self-awareness--that is, enabling students to think outside of concept boundaries in hope of enhancing creative potential. Based on meta-cognition theory, we developed an integrated concept mapping system (ICMSys) to improve users' conceptual self-awareness in addition to applying concept mapping techniques in traditional learning scenarios. Since the ICMSys accommodates different perspectives, selected ideas made by peers are retained with the help of integrated concept map (ICMap) representations used as stimuli for reflective thinking. Results from a case study with 32 information management undergraduates indicate: (a) increased levels of conceptual self-awareness, (b) evidence of conceptual improvement in the students' redrawn concept maps, (c) that ICMap viewing frequency exerted a positive impact on level of conceptual self-awareness, and (d) a significant correlation between level of conceptual self-awareness in redrawn personal concept maps and actual conceptual changes as determined by three experts. We describe student perceptions of the ICMSys in terms of comprehension practicality and conceptual self-awareness, and give suggestions for future research. (Contains 6 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - When students understand content deeply, they recognize main concepts and understand the relationships among ideas. But the typical processes students use to study are generally not designed to generate conceptual understandings. Instead, they tend to become passive learners. In this article, the authors present three commonly used classroom techniques--bell work, worksheets, and laboratory investigations--that have been converted from passive to active learning strategies. They also draw on the active and passive learning research to help teachers examine the structure of typical classroom instruction (Bransford, Brown, and Cocking 2000). (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - This pilot study focuses on the potential of Evidence-based Dialogue Mapping as a participatory action research tool to investigate young teenagers' scientific argumentation. Evidence-based Dialogue Mapping is a technique for representing graphically an argumentative dialogue through Questions, Ideas, Pros, Cons and Data. Our research objective is to better understand the usage of Compendium, a Dialogue Mapping software tool, as both (1) a learning strategy to scaffold school pupils' argumentation, and (2) as a method to investigate the quality of their argumentative essays. The participants were a science teacher-researcher, a knowledge mapping researcher and 20 pupils, 12-13 years old, in a summer science course for "gifted and talented" children in the UK. This study draws on multiple data sources: discussion forum, science teacher-researchers' and pupils' Dialogue Maps, pupil essays and reflective comments about the uses of mapping for writing. Through qualitative analysis of two case studies, we examine the role of Evidence-based Dialogue Maps as a mediating tool in scientific reasoning: as "conceptual bridges" for linking and making knowledge intelligible; as support for the "linearization task" of generating a coherent document outline; as a "reflective aid" to rethinking reasoning in response to teacher feedback; and as a "visual language" for making arguments tangible via cartographic conventions.

AB  - This study assessed the influence of using mind maps as a learning tool on eighth graders' science achievement, whether such influence was mediated by students' prior scholastic achievement, and the relationship between students' mind maps and their conceptual understandings. Sixty-two students enrolled in four intact sections of a grade 8 science classroom were randomly assigned to experimental and comparison conditions. Participants in the experimental group received training in, and constructed, mind maps throughout a science unit. Engagement with mind mapping was counterbalanced with involving the comparison group participants with note summarization to control for time on task as a confounding variable. Otherwise, the intervention was similar for both groups in all respects. A multiple choice test was used to measure student gains across two categories and three levels of achievement. Data analyses indicated that the experimental group participants achieved statistically significant and substantially higher gains than students in the comparison group. The gains were not mediated by participants' prior scholastic achievement. Analyses also indicated that iconography was not as central to participants' mind maps as often theorized. Depicting accurate links between central themes and major and minor concepts, and using colors to represent concepts were the major aspects that differentiated the mind maps built by students who achieved higher levels of conceptual understanding.

AB  - We investigated whether and how prior knowledge activation improves learning outcomes for high school (less experienced learners) and university students (experienced learners) in a hypertext environment. Map coherence was defined as the extent to which relationships between the concepts in the map were made explicit. Therefore, we classified the mapping task of creating and labeling lines as low-coherent, and the mapping task of labeling provided lines as high-coherent. Learners were randomly assigned to the conditions of (1) high-coherent knowledge activation; (2) low-coherent knowledge activation; and (3) a baseline condition without prior knowledge activation. We found an overall effect for prior knowledge activation, learning experience, and an interaction between learning experience and the coherence of the prior knowledge activation task on learning outcomes. High school students benefited most from labeling provided lines, while university physics majors benefited most from creating and labeling lines. This interaction effect and effects of the specific mapping tasks on process measures support the claim that different prior knowledge activation tasks are suited for different groups of learners.

AB  - This study was designed to theoretically articulate and empirically assess the role of computer scaffolds. In this project, several examples of educational software were developed to scaffold the learning of students performing high level cognitive activities. The software used in this study, Artemis, focused on scaffolding the learning of students as they performed information seeking activities. As 5th grade students traveled through a project-based science unit on photosynthesis, researchers used a pre-post design to test for both student motivation and student conceptual understanding of photosynthesis. To measure both variables, a motivation survey and three methods of concept map analysis were used. The student use of the scaffolding features was determined using a database that tracked students' movement between scaffolding tools. The gain scores of each dependent variable was then correlated to the students' feature use (time and hits) embedded in the Artemis Interface. This provided the researchers with significant relationships between the scaffolding features represented in the software and student motivation and conceptual understanding of photosynthesis. There were a total of three significant correlations in comparing the scaffolding use by hits (clicked on) with the dependent variables and only one significant correlation when comparing the scaffold use in time. The first significant correlation (r = 0.499, p less than 0.05) was between the saving/viewing features hits and the students' task value. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the saving/viewing features and the students' perception of how interesting, how important, and how useful the task is. The second significant correlation (r = 0.553, p less than 0.01) was between the searching features hits and the students' self-efficacy for learning and performance. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the searching features and the students' perception of their ability to accomplish a task as well as their confidence in their skills to perform that task. The third significant correlation (r = 0.519, p less than 0.05) was between the collaborative features hits and the students' essay performance scores. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the collaborative features and the students' ability to perform high cognitive tasks. Finally, the last significant correlation (r = 0.576, p less than 0.01) was between the maintenance features time and the qualitative analysis of the concept maps. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the maintenance features and student conceptual understanding of photosynthesis.

AB  - This study describes 5th, 8th, and 11th-grade students', teachers', and medical professionals' conceptions of flu and microbial illness. Participants constructed a concept map on "flu" and participated in a semi-structured interview. The results showed that these groups of students, teachers and medical professionals held and structured their conceptions about microbes differently. A progression toward more accurate and complete knowledge existed across the groups but this trajectory was not always a predictable, linear developmental path from novice to expert. Across the groups, participants were most knowledgeable about symptoms of microbial illness, treatments of symptoms, and routes of transmission for respiratory illnesses. This knowledge was tightly linked to participants' prior experiences with colds and flu. There were typically large gaps in participants' (children and teachers) understandings of vaccines, immune system responses, treatments (including the mechanisms of pain medications and the functions of antibiotics), and transmission of non-respiratory microbial illness. A common misconception held by students was the belief that antibiotics can cure viral infections.

AB  - In Technology Enhanced Learning Environments, self-regulated learning (SRL) partly relies on the features of the technological tools. The authors present two environments they designed in order to facilitate SRL: the first one (e-Dalgo) is a website dedicated to the learning of algorithms and computer programming. It is structured as a classical course but also provides students with self-evaluation tools and forums. The second environment (the MEMORAe project) is structured on the basis of the concepts of a domain (for example a statistics and probability course). Students have access not only to course notions and related resources but also to different kinds of memories and communication tools that are also based on the domain concepts. The authors' empirical evaluations of the two environments showed that, though very different in their approaches, both appear to be quite efficient regarding cognitive aspects, but social aspects are more difficult to observe and to foster.

AB  - In this study we measured changes in science teachers' conceptual science understanding (content knowledge) and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) while participating in a problem-based learning (PBL) model of professional development. Teachers participated in a two-week long workshop followed by nine monthly meetings during one academic year that focused on deepening their content understanding and their teaching practices. We analyzed teachers' short writings and concept map depictions of their understanding, and found teachers significantly developed components of pedagogical content knowledge and clinical reasoning, such as knowledge of assessment. Gains on conceptual understanding of science, however, were limited to one group of teachers. We conclude that this PBL approach to professional development advanced components of science teachers' strategic pedagogical content knowledge and discuss the ongoing challenges in measuring changes in teachers' understanding in the context of an evolving PBL model of professional development.

AB  - Students' understanding of science develops through everyday experiences. As a result, they come to the science classroom with their own notions of how the world works. As teachers, we often must help students overcome their prior naive notions and move them toward a more scientific understanding. This process, known as conceptual change, is fundamental to student learning. It can be aided with strategies designed to help students rationalize their perceptions in light of accepted scientific understanding. This article outlines one such strategy: a process of recursive concept mapping the authors call "mapping for conceptual change." (Contains 6 figures and 2 online resources.)

AB  - Creativity, which has now entered the discourse in higher education alongside other agenda items such as enterprise, entrepreneurship and innovation, is an elusive and complex notion. It may evade the sort of definition, categorisation and compartmentalisation required to integrate it fully into the curriculum frameworks and assessment regimes that are currently in place in higher education. After a contextualisation of the subject, this paper describes the outcomes of a phenomenographic research project that set out to identify the qualitatively different ways university lecturers, across a range of arts, humanities and science disciplines, conceptualise creativity in relation to their pedagogic practice.

AB  - An electronic portfolio system, designed to serve as a resource-based learning space, was tested in a fifth-grade science class. The control-group students accessed a traditional folder-based information display in the system and the experimental-group students accessed a concept map-based information display to review a science portfolio. The student-constructed science portfolio was a result of a collection of digital artefacts such as graphic images, instructional videos and textual files on terms and definitions relevant to the Earth's atmosphere. In the information-processing performance test, the experimental-group students scored significantly higher and spent much less time in finding answers to the questions presented. Also, in the 3-day delayed memory retention tests, the experimental-group students achieved significantly higher scores. The multiple regression models confirm that the visualisation variation is the most significant predictor for student performance (ie, comprehension and access time). Also, the regression models suggest that language-arts proficiency may reduce overall system access time; while higher math proficiency may predict retention scores.

AB  - Based on the recommendation of the AAAS and the NRC, middle level science is the rightful introduction for a systems approach, including the study of its parts, subsystems, interconnections, and interrelationships. Dr. Seuss's "The Lorax" provides an excellent opportunity to combine ecological consequences within a systems approach (Sweeney 2001). The inquiry-based lesson described here is designed using the 5E instructional model and develops students' critical-thinking skills as they create concept maps to depict the relationships among components of a larger system.

AB  - The skill set required of biomedical researchers continues to grow and evolve as biology matures as a natural science. Science necessitates creative yet critical thinking, persuasive communication skills, purposeful use of time, and adeptness at the laboratory bench. Teaching these skills can be effectively accomplished in an inquiry-based, active-learning environment at a primarily undergraduate institution. Cell Biology Techniques, an upper-level cell biology laboratory course at St. John Fisher College, features two independent projects that take advantage of the biology of the nematode "Caenorhabditis elegans", a premier yet simple model organism. First, students perform a miniature epigenetic screen for novel phenotypes using RNA interference. The results of this screen combined with literature research direct students toward a singe gene that they attempt to subclone in the second project. The biology of the chosen gene/protein also becomes an individualized focal point with respect to the content of the laboratory. Progress toward course goals is evaluated using written, oral, and group-produced assignments, including a concept map. Pre- and postassessment indicates a significant increase in the understanding of broad concepts in cell biological research. (Contains 1 table and 4 figures.)

AB  - An experiment explicitly introducing learning strategies to a large, first-year undergraduate cell biology course was undertaken to see whether awareness and use of strategies had a measurable impact on student performance. The construction of concept maps was selected as the strategy to be introduced because of an inherent coherence with a course structured by concepts. Data were collected over three different semesters of an introductory cell biology course, all teaching similar course material with the same professor and all evaluated using similar examinations. The first group, used as a control, did not construct concept maps, the second group constructed individual concept maps, and the third group first constructed individual maps then validated their maps in small teams to provide peer feedback about the individual maps. Assessment of the experiment involved student performance on the final exam, anonymous polls of student perceptions, failure rate, and retention of information at the start of the following year. The main conclusion drawn is that concept maps without feedback have no significant effect on student performance, whereas concept maps with feedback produced a measurable increase in student problem-solving performance and a decrease in failure rates.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effects of concept maps, together with conceptual change texts, given to 11th grade students' on the subject of molecules carrying genetical information. The semistructured individual interviews were conducted with 5 upper class students to find misconceptions related to the subject. A success test was developed in the light of information taken from both literature and also interviews. This test was applied to the control group, who was taking traditional educational courses, and to the sample group students who were taking classes using concept maps and conceptual change texts together. The data was collected from 50 students; the groups consisted of 25 in the sample group and 25 in the control group. It was found that the conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping instruction produced a positive effect on students' understanding of the concept. The average percent of correct responses of the experimental group was 61.6% and that of the control group was 53.6% after treatment. (Contains 6 tables.)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of instruction (application) including interactive computer animation accompanied by teacher and student-prepared concept maps on primary students' biology achievement during instruction, as well as revealing attitudes towards science as a school subject. A quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test control group design was used in this study. The experimental group had 31 students and the control group had 34 students. The experimental group received instruction including interactive computer animation accompanied by teacher- and student-prepared concept maps, while the control group received traditional instruction. A biology achievement test and an attitude scale toward science were used as data collection instruments. The present study indicates that the experimental group had significantly higher scores than the control group in the biology achievement test (regarding cells and other related concepts). Regarding students' attitudes toward science as a school subject, there was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups in the pre- and post-test results. However there was a statistically significant difference between the gain scores of the control group and the experimental group in favor of the experimental group. (Contains 1 figure and 4 tables.)

AB  - Various methods have been performed to identify teachers' attitudes towards assessment. Recognizing the idea that mapping is one of the most efficient tools, this study was aimed to investigate the effectiveness of attitude maps in the evaluation of teachers' attitudes towards assessment. The instrument, composed of open-ended questions, was utilized during the semi-structured interview protocol and used as the study's data collection tool. Attitude maps were constructed during the evaluation process to represent the pre-service teachers' attitudes' towards assessment. The participants' attitudes were determined and categorized as traditional, close to traditional, transitional, close to constructivist, and constructivist. Criterion validity of the results was achieved by comparing the categories drawn from the attitude maps with the categories derived by the survey. Results indicate that attitude mapping is a useful way to evaluate teachers' attitudes towards assessment. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - The use of self-organizing feature maps (SOFM) in models of cognitive development has frequently been associated with explanations of "critical" or "sensitive periods". By contrast, error-driven connectionist models of development have been linked with "catastrophic interference" between new knowledge and old knowledge. We introduce a set of simulations that systematically evaluate the conditions under which SOFMs demonstrate critical/sensitive periods in development versus those under which they display interference effects. We explored the relative contribution of network parameters (for example, whether learning rate and neighbourhood reduce across training), the representational resources available to the network, and the similarity between old and new knowledge in determining the functional plasticity of the maps. The SOFMs that achieved the best discrimination and topographic organization also exhibited sensitive periods in development while showing lower plasticity and hence limited interference. However, fast developing, coarser SOFMs also produced topologically organized representations, while permanently retaining their plasticity. We argue that the impact of map organization on behaviour must be interpreted in terms of the cognitive processes that the map is driving.

AB  - Classroom teachers serve a critical role in developing environmentally literate citizens. In this study, the authors assessed K-8 preservice teachers' understanding of basic ecological concepts. Participants (N = 56) constructed concept maps describing the inter-relationships among 16 ecological concepts. The authors analyzed the concept maps to determine how participants organized, associated, and described relationships between the concepts. Although there was a lack of consistency in associating pairs of concepts, participants often created 2 clusters of concepts: a food web cluster and an ecosystem cluster. Associated pairs were often used in similar ways to describe the relationship among concepts. Concepts such as biotic factors and abiotic factors were frequently not used. It is important to ensure that preservice teachers have a solid understanding of ecological concepts before they begin teaching. (Contains 4 figures and 5 tables.)

AB  - A key challenge of effective teaching is assessing and monitoring the extent to which students have assimilated the material they were taught. Concept mapping is a methodology designed to model what students have learned. In effect, it seeks to produce graphical representations (called concept maps) of the concepts that are important to a given domain and how they are related, according to the students. In recent decades various methods have emerged to evaluate concept maps, each measuring different features of concept maps. New approaches are still being developed. Few guidelines are available regarding the method to choose for a given application. This paper is a literature review that consists of two parts. The first is a review of the many automated and manual techniques of concept map analysis. The second is a critical and reflective commentary on these techniques. (Contains 3 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - Given the massive amount of science and mathematics content available online, libraries working with science teachers can become lost when attempting to select material that is both compelling for the learner and effective in addressing learning goals. Tools that help educators identify the most appropriate resources can be a great time saver. Especially useful are tools that not only provide ready access to quality digital materials, but also make the process of searching itself a learning experience. The goal of such digital libraries as the National Science Digital Library (NSDL), the National Science Foundation's online library in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education and research, is to provide better access to science and math content so these materials can be used effectively. In this article, the author describes a tool that allows users to search and identify resources selected from the NSDL collection and provides an example of how it is used.

AB  - This article is about an investigation of six middle school science teachers' beliefs and instructional practice about the coherence of the science they teach as articulated by National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996). Many well intentioned reform efforts focus on improving content knowledge of teachers, but many classroom teachers regularly miss opportunities to provide conceptual connections within the science ideas building the sense of coherence in science. This investigation involved a quasi experimental study to examine the efficacy of a method for collecting data about middle school science teachers' thinking about science and to determine if they teach science coherently. The teachers were surveyed, interviewed, provided concept maps about their thinking of the science they taught, and observed to investigate whether their practice reflects their beliefs. An examination of the teachers' beliefs, stated and unstated curriculum, the connections among topics and the nature of science revealed that one, the observation tool may have merit for identifying the content and connections among science topics, and two, that teachers' stated beliefs consistent with the National Science Education Standards' vision for coherent science, did not match their demonstrated practice. The content taught could be characterized in three ways; coherent content and few connections, coherent content and connections, and not coherent content. This indicates for this group of middle school science teachers that knowing how they think about science and how those beliefs are reflected in their teaching is complex. This study can inform teacher education and professional development efforts about the need to move beyond just content enhancement to examine prior beliefs about the connections of concepts within science.

AB  - To explore the ways in which teacher-guided and student-centered instructional approaches influence students' conceptual understanding of seasonal change, we designed a technology-enhanced learning (TEL) course to compare, by means of concept maps, the learning outcome of students in two groups: a teacher-guided (TG) class (with whole-class presentations) and a student-centered (SC) class (with individual online learning). The participants were two classes of second-year senior high school students in Taiwan. Overall, the results showed that most students developed a deep and accessible understanding of the reasons for the seasons after undergoing experiences provided by the TEL course. More importantly, it was found that, in this technologically enhanced environment, the student-centered approach was more effective than the teacher-guided approach in altering students' alternative conceptions of seasonal change (F = 28.05, p less than 0.001). The conceptual evolution of students in the two groups was plotted and compared. These plots indicated that, first of all, the cognitive processes of contextualization and sense making helped students re-examine their old ideas about the phenomena, leading them to generate alternative conceptions and undergo both positive and negative conceptual change. The student-centered approach allows students to more freely test their own hypotheses in the processes of exploration and modeling, and thus move from assimilatory to properly scientific explanations.

AB  - In the past decade, researchers have attempted to develop computer-assisted learning and testing systems to help students improve their learning performance. Conventional testing systems simply provide students with a score, and do not offer sufficient information in order to improve their learning performance. It would be of more benefit to students if the test results could be critically analysed and hence learning suggestions could be offered accordingly. This study proposes an algorithm for diagnosing students' learning problems and provides personalised learning suggestions for Science and Mathematics courses. An intelligent tutoring, evaluation and diagnosis system has been implemented based on the novel approach. Experimental results on a Mathematics course have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in enhancing students' learning performance, making it highly promising for further study.

AB  - The purposes of this article are to provide the sequence of learning events about the integration of curricula and technology using modules prepared by the Southeast Teachers Are Revitalizing Teaching Through Technology (START) Technology Team and to describe the impact these technology modules had on university faculty and candidates at Alabama State University. The START technology workshops were funded by a grant from the United States Department of Education-Office of Postsecondary Education. The purposes of the grant were to train higher education faculty how to integrate START and science curricula using tenets of the constructivist theory; then replicate the content of the technology modules at the post-secondary level. Participants who attended replication workshops completed two evaluation sheets: (a) Self-Evaluation Checklists and (b) START Evaluations. Both evaluations were used to determine whether learning objectives of the workshop had been met and to make decisions about how to improve the quality of the next workshop. The implementation and modification of START technology modules began to facilitate life-long learning among workshop participants because of their abilities to: (a) access teaching resources such as web-quest lesson plans; (b) design formative assessments structured as rubrics; (c) prepare curriculum and concept maps used to organize, display, and share data; and (d) organize electronic portfolios which demonstrate achievement and professional development.

AB  - The authors have created a software system called the CAVEman, for the visual integration and exploration of heterogeneous anatomical and biomedical data. The CAVEman can be applied for both education and research tasks. The main component of the system is a three-dimensional digital atlas of the adult male human anatomy, structured according to the nomenclature of "Terminologia Anatomica"..The underlying data-indexing mechanism uses standard ontologies to map a range of biomedical data types onto the atlas. The CAVEman system is now used to visualize genetic processes in the context of the human anatomy and to facilitate visual exploration of the data. Through the use of Java[TM] software, the atlas-based system is portable to virtually any computer environment, including personal computers and workstations. Existing Java tools for biomedical data analysis have been incorporated into the system. The affordability of virtual-reality installations has increased dramatically over the last several years. This creates new opportunities for educational scenarios that model important processes in a patient's body, including gene expression patterns, metabolic activity, the effects of interventions such as drug treatments, and eventually surgical simulations.

AB  - Determining students' knowledge structure is important for assessing what a learner knows about a domain of knowledge. Traditional assessment methods are not always appropriate for exploring students' knowledge structure and changes during the learning period. This study investigates how the existing knowledge structure of the learners interacts with content knowledge to produce a new knowledge structure relating to atomic theories, and whether a word association test (WAT) could be used to assess changes in students' knowledge structure. Participants' (40 elementary science education minors enrolled in a general chemistry class) knowledge structure was examined using WAT before and following a unit of instruction on atomic theories. In order to map the structures, relatedness coefficient values and response frequencies were used. When the maps obtained from these methods were examined it was seen that both had limitations. For this reason a new/different mapping technique was developed and used. It showed that the differences in the students' knowledge structures before and after instruction make it clear that instruction had affected the knowledge structure.

AB  - In response to the demand for sound science assessments, this article presents the development of a latent construct called knowledge integration as an effective measure of science inquiry. Knowledge integration assessments ask students to link, distinguish, evaluate, and organize their ideas about complex scientific topics. The article focuses on assessment topics commonly taught in 6th- through 12th-grade classes. Items from both published standardized tests and previous knowledge integration research were examined in 6 subject-area tests. Results from Rasch partial credit analyses revealed that the tests exhibited satisfactory psychometric properties with respect to internal consistency, item fit, weighted likelihood estimates, discrimination, and differential item functioning. Compared with items coded using dichotomous scoring rubrics, those coded with the knowledge integration rubrics yielded significantly higher discrimination indexes. The knowledge integration assessment tasks, analyzed using knowledge integration scoring rubrics, demonstrate strong promise as effective measures of complex science reasoning in varied science domains.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to: (1) examine whether or not the construction of concept maps by students improves their achievement and ability to solve higher order questions in chemistry, (2) investigate the differential effect of the treatment by gender and achievement level, and (3) explore the relationships between performance on concept maps and chemistry achievement. Participants were 60 tenth-grade students randomly divided into two groups. The study spanned six weeks in a class that met five times a week. The material covered was acid-base titration and equilibrium in weak acids. The students were pre- and post-tested using a teacher-constructed chemistry test. Results showed that while there were no significant differences on the achievement total score, there were significant differences favoring the experimental group for scores on the knowledge level questions. Moreover, there were sex-achievement interactions at the knowledge and comprehension level questions favoring females and achievement level--achievement interactions favoring low achievers. Finally, there were significant correlations between students' scores on high level questions and the convergence and total concept map scores. (Contains 14 tables.)

AB  - This study investigated the effect of concept mapping over traditional instruction on students' understanding and retention of heat and temperature concepts. The sample of this study consisted of 5th grade students from two classes of a elementary school (n=75). One intact class was randomly assigned to the comparison group whereas the other one was randomly assigned to the experimental group. During teaching the topic of heat and temperature concepts in earth science curriculum, the experimental group was taught with the concept mapping instruction while the comparison group was taught with the traditional instruction. The results revealed that the students in the experimental group performed better on heat and temperature concepts. However, it has been found that there was no significant difference between experimental and control group on students' retention scores of heat and temperature concept test. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Concept maps consist of nodes that represent concepts and links that represent relationships between concepts. Various studies have shown that concept mapping fosters meaningful learning. However, little is known about the specific cognitive processes that are responsible for such mapping effects. In a thinking-aloud study, we analyzed the relations between cognitive processes during concept mapping as well as the characteristics of the concept maps that the learners produced and learning outcomes (38 university students). To test whether differences in learning outcome are due to differences in general abilities, verbal and spatial abilities were also assessed. In a cluster-analysis two types of ineffective learners were identified: "non-labeling mappers" and "non-planning mappers". Effective learners, in contrast, showed much effort in planning their mapping process and constructing a coherent concept map. These strategies were more evident in students with prior concept-mapping experience ("advanced beginners") than in those who had not used this learning strategy before ("successful beginners"). Based on the present findings, suggestions for a direct training approach (i.e., strategy training with worked-out examples) and an indirect training approach (i.e., supporting the learners with strategy prompts) were developed.

AB  - Although researchers in higher education propose alternatives to traditional approaches to assessment, traditional methods are commonly used in college or university science courses. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility and validity of Prospective Science Teachers' (PSTs) concept maps as authentic assessment tools in a student-centred approach to describe the changes in the conceptual understanding of the PSTs in general chemistry laboratory investigations. After the PSTs (n = 47) decided on important issues, such as who would assess their concept maps and what scoring strategy and criteria would be used, they practiced assessing their own and peers' concept maps during the first five laboratory investigations. They subsequently constructed and assessed pre- and post-laboratory concept maps in a student-centred approach consisting of self, peer, and instructor assessments for the five remaining laboratory investigations. The results of the study showed using pre- and post-laboratory concept maps as authentic assessment tools in a student-centred approach was valid and reliable for describing the conceptual understanding of the PSTs in a university general chemistry laboratory course. The results of individual interviews indicated most PSTs had positive views of their assessment practices in the laboratory course. This study also provides pedagogical implications for the training of science teachers.

AB  - Commercial computer games contain "physics engine" components, responsible for providing realistic interactions among game objects. The question naturally arises of whether these engines can be used to develop educational materials for high school and university physics education. To answer this question, the author's group recently conducted a detailed scientific investigation of the physics engine of Unreal Tournament 2004 (UT2004). This article presents their motivation, methodology, and results. The author presents the findings of experiments that probed the accessibility and fidelity of UT2004's physics engine, examples of educational materials developed, and an evaluation of their use in high school classes. The associated pedagogical implications of this approach are discussed, and the author suggests guidelines for educators on how to deploy the approach. Key resources are presented on an associated Web site. (Contains 9 figures, 1 table and 1 note.)

AB  - Riparian ecosystems are an exciting and dynamic subject for study. These areas are valuable lands and important wildlife habitats, and they contribute greatly to the environmental health of an area. Definitions for the term "riparian" vary, but in this curriculum, the land called the "Green Zone" lies between flowing water and upland ecosystems. Vegetation and soils in this zone provide valuable services for people, livestock, water resources, wildlife, and plant species. This "Leader Guide" was written to help science teachers/youth leaders make the best use of the "Holding onto the Green Zone" Action Guide. The Leader Guide can be used to help meet these important objectives: (1) Introduce youth to the important components and functions of riparian zones as they relate to water quality and quantity, soils, vegetation, wildlife, erosion, floods, and land uses; (2) Encourage community awareness and stewardship of riparian zones; (3) Relay technical information about riparian zones in simple language and terms for nonscientists; (4) Assist young people in learning basic Earth Science concepts; (5) Help schools incorporate riparian education into the science curriculum; and (6) Promote better land use and natural resource management through increased awareness and understanding. Educating children, involving them and their communities in hands-on activities, and encouraging stewardship at the local level are critical steps toward achieving widespread riparian-zone restoration and protection. Appended are: (1) Selected Riparian Curricula, Activities, and Additional Resources; (2) "Holding onto the Green Zone " Curriculum Concept Map; (3) Correlations to Education Standards; (4) Related Internet Resources for Activities; (5) PFC Lotic Checklist; and (6) Key to Macroinvertebrate Life in the River.

AB  - This study aims at highlighting the collaborative activity of two high school students (age 14) in the cases of modeling the complex biological process of plant growth with two different tools: the "paper & pencil" concept mapping technique and the computer-supported educational environment "ModelsCreator". Students' shared activity in both cases is carried out in the presence of a facilitator providing technical as well as cognitive support when necessary. The objective of the study is to highlight the ways in which the collaborating students are engaged in the plant growth modeling activity in the two cases and also identify the activity's similar and different aspects in each one. Our analysis is carried out on two complementary axes, the first of which concerns the "process" of collaboratively creating a plant growth model with each different tool, while the second has to do with the students' conceptualizations of the biological aspect of the modeling task in each case. A two-level analytic tool for the modeling process has been derived within the theoretical framework of "activity theory" on the basis of the "OCAF" scheme for "basic modeling operations" and the scheme of Stratford et al. [Stratford, S. J., Krajcik, J., & Soloway, E. (1998). Secondary students' dynamic modeling processes: analyzing, reasoning about, synthesizing, and testing models of stream ecosystems. "Journal of Science Education and Technology," 7(3), 215-234.] for "higher-order modeling actions." According to our results, four major "modeling actions (analysis, synthesis, testing-interpreting, technical and cognitive support)" performed through a plethora of "modeling operations" define the steps of the modeling process in both cases, while specific qualitative differences can be actually identified. Finally, the students' conceptualizations of the biological aspect of the modeling task in the two-case activity is analyzed in regard with their capability of shifting reasoning between macro- and micro-levels, while educational implications are also discussed.

AB  - Bacterial conjugation is a genetic transfer that involves cell-to-cell between donor and recipient cells. With the current method used to teach students in genetic courses at the undergraduate level, the transconjugants are identified using bacterial physiology and/or antibiotic resistance. Using physiology, however, is difficult for both first-year undergraduates and special science students at the high school levels, who do not have the basic knowledge. We have developed a laboratory exercise that comprises a simple and rapid technique for transferring bacterial DNA by conjugation and examining the transconjuants using only antibiotic resistance on agar. The identity of the right transconjuants is confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. This exercise is designed to help students understand how horizontal gene transfer occurs in bacteria by conjugation using "Escherichia coli" as a hands-on learning model. Students should be able to draw concept maps of three DNA transfer methods on their own after carrying out the experiment and getting some additional information.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to describe the changes in one student's ideas about force and one-dimensional motion concepts and portray the relevant metaconceptual processes that she engaged in during the implementation of metaconceptual teaching interventions. Metaconceptual processes involves metacognitive processes that are directly acting on or related to individuals' conceptions, mental models or elements of their conceptual ecology. Several types of instructional activities including poster drawing, concept mapping, group debate, journal writing and group and class discussions were used to activate students' metaconceptual processes. The findings of the study indicated that the student changed all of her alternative ideas that were assessed before the instruction with scientifically accepted conceptions following the instruction. The findings also showed that the student engaged in several types of metaconceptual processes ranging from simple awareness of ideas to more sophisticated metaconceptual processes, such as metaconceptual monitoring and evaluation. The findings strengthen the claims about the positive impact of metaconceptual processes on changing students' conceptions of physical world.

AB  - Two concept maps have been developed to represent the organization of the material in a first-semester general chemistry course into two overall themes: a structure and properties theme and a quantitative chemical relationships theme. By providing these maps to students and referring to them in class, it is hoped that the instructor can assist students in maintaining a grasp of the "big picture" during the progress of the course.

AB  - Thomas Locker's book about nature entitled "Water Dance" (1997) provides the basis for this interdisciplinary project on Earth's water cycles. Through thoughtful consideration of the text and art in "Water Dance," students build and express deeper understanding of the water cycle (and the elements within). In addition, they develop the disposition of questioning and thinking about their learning experiences in creative and expansive ways. (Contains 1 figure, 2 resources and 1 online resource.)

AB  - By the end of their high school studies, students should be able to understand macroscopic and sub-microscopic conceptualization of acid-base behavior and the relationship between these conceptual models. The aim of this article is to ascertain whether grade-12 students have sufficient background knowledge to explain the properties of acids, bases, and salts from their constituent ions or molecules. In addition, this research seeks to discern if certain learning difficulties are due to this lack of knowledge. Two concept maps are used for evaluation including the conceptual and procedural knowledge of acid-base behavior of substances. The diagnostic instrument consists of five questionnaires and two interviews. This study reveals that grade-12 students lack some of the necessary knowledge and skills to understand the acid-base behavior of substances. This could explain why students cannot differentiate between an ionic and non-ionic substance and that they associate the existence of H or OH in the formula with acid or basic reaction, respectively, without differentiating between atoms and ions. Students do not understand the different types of particles or the meaning of the subscript or superscript in a polyatomic ion formula. They do not differentiate between the ion and atom of an element and consequently find it difficult to interpret the properties of substances such as solution in water and electrical conductivity.

AB  - This article reports the findings of Phase II of our study of student use of web-based tutorial materials for general chemistry and student understanding of chemistry concepts. We have found that students who use the web site valued the aspects of visualization of chemistry concepts and availability of materials online. In our analysis of student understanding of chemistry concepts by way of concept maps, we found that students who used the web site showed a similar level of understanding of chemistry to that of the students who did not use the web site, but that the web site users attempted to make more concept map links about the relevant chemistry concepts. Similarly to our finding in Phase I of the study, most students thought that the Web was a good way to get help learning chemistry. (Contains 2 figures and 3 tables.)

AB  - With the proliferation of technology, electronic texts in the form of hypertext and hypermedia systems as well as digital libraries are increasingly being used in scientific inquiry. Digital or hypertext documents are nonlinear and flexible, and enable students to follow their own investigation paths. However, the flexibility also poses challenges for students as it pushes students to make decisions as they selectively browse through the space. The research described in this paper aimed to understand (1) how providing students with a visual representation that mirrors the conceptual structure of the domain affects navigation and learning and (2) whether continued use of a hypertext system enables students to learn from it regardless of its structure.

AB  - Collaborative concept mapping engages two or more students in coordinated and sustained efforts in the creation of one or more concept maps in order to learn and construct knowledge. It is a potentially powerful instructional strategy in that it fosters meaningful learning and group knowledge construction and helps the building of common ground among learners. However, limited research studies in this area have generated mixed findings. This article attempts to find possible reasons for the mixed findings by reviewing some studies that specifically addressed the use of concept mapping in individual learning and/or group knowledge construction. Based on the findings, the article proposes the use of other instructional strategies along with collaborative concept mapping for better implementation of the technique in both face-to-face and online environments. The implications for further investigations in this area are also discussed. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)

AB  - The reading of science-related, historical nonfiction alone does not necessarily lead students to make personal connections to science or understand science as a human endeavor interdependent with culture, society, and history. Teachers must structure students' reading to ensure that they consider specific aspects of science while reading and discussing books. In this article, the author discusses the use of literature-circles as an approach for teachers to focus their students' attention on components of the nature of science. Literature circles are "small, temporary discussion groups" in which students are provided prompts or "roles". The purpose of literature-circle roles is to guide students to develop understanding of particular concepts as they explore the text and meaningfully participate in small-group discussion.

AB  - Making connections is an emerging education theme of the 21st century. Science teachers are encouraged to connect new learning with prior knowledge, learning with student interests and experience, and classroom activities with the history and nature of science. Strategies that facilitate these connections enrich and enhance instruction. In this article, the authors explore the use of narrative informational book circles, connection charts, and notebooks to showcase science as a human endeavor. Narrative informational book circles provide a flexible structure that encourages students to engage in critical thinking and reflection as they read, discuss, and respond to carefully chosen nonfiction science trade books. Connection charts, story pyramids, and science notebooks are the tools used to guide book circles. A connection chart helps students focus discussions and organize ideas. Story pyramids demonstrate comprehension of important story elements, and science notebooks provide opportunities for personal reflection. All three can be used as formative assessments.

AB  - Pupils with autism often present significant challenges to teachers. They seem to have real strengths in visual processing but a cognitive style that encourages them to focus on detail rather than the overarching connections between concepts. Veronica Roberts, currently undertaking doctoral training at the Institute of Education, University of London, in order to become an educational psychologist, and Richard Joiner, senior lecturer in the Department of Psychology at the University of Bath, set out to explore these issues. In this article, they report the outcomes of a naturalistic experiment in which they investigated the utility of concept mapping as an educational strategy with pupils diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). Theoretical arguments supporting the use of concept mapping with an autistic population are outlined in the paper. A tutor group of ten pupils with ASD, aged between 11 and 14 years, took part in the study. Concept mapping tasks were integrated within National Curriculum science lessons in collaboration with the school's science teacher. The study found that the increase in pupil performance in subject-specific questionnaires was nearly four times greater in the concept mapping condition than after a more conventional teaching intervention. Veronica Roberts and Richard Joiner tentatively draw out the implications of their work for staff who work with pupils with ASD and make recommendations for further research into the use of these learning strategies.

AB  - There are two main claims in this article. First, that the classic pillars of engineering education, namely, traditional mathematics and differential equations, are merely a particular, if not old-fashioned, representation of a broader mathematical vision, which spans from Turing machine programming and symbolic productions sets to sub-symbolic orderings such as artificial neural nets. Second, that the paradigm of equivalence ought to be extended to those non-traditional engineering disciplines that require at least the same dedication, such as music and its science, musicology, because they broaden the search and identification of structures, one of the most important tasks of creative engineering. Furthermore, an example of contemporary advanced technology will be given that favours these very claims. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - This paper introduces various visual models for the analysis and description of learning processes. The models analyse learning on two levels: the dynamic level (as a process over time) and the functional level. Two types of model for dynamic modelling are proposed: the session trace, which documents a specific learner in a particular learning session; and the state diagram, which depicts the various stages which learners may encounter when they attempt to learn a new concept or solve a problem. A functional model is used to depict the flow of knowledge between various participants and objects in the learning process. The visual model adopted for functional modelling is based on the use of data-flow diagrams. A methodology for the construction of each type of model is presented and practical demonstrations of these are given. (Contains 10 figures.)

AB  - Electronic game technologies can prepare novice learners for future learning of complex concepts. This paper describes the underlying instructional design, learning science, cognitive science, and game theory. A structural, or syntactic mapping (structure mapping), approach to game design can produce a game world relationally isomorphic to a targeted complex concept. Such a game world should provide experiential and reflective gameplay to help learners form a preconceptual mental model of the targeted concept. A preparation for future learning (PFL) approach would follow gameplay with direct instruction. (Contains 2 figures, 1 table and 4 notes.)

AB  - In higher education, instructors' choices of both curricular material and pedagogy are determined by their beliefs about learning and teaching, the values of their profession, and perceived external constraints. Dissemination of research-based educational reforms is based on assumptions about that mental structure. This study reports the initial phase of an investigation of the beliefs and values of physics professors as they relate to the teaching and learning of problem solving in introductory physics. Based on an analysis of a series of structured interviews with six college physics faculty, a model of a common structure of such beliefs for all physics faculty teaching introductory physics was constructed. This preliminary model, when tested and modified by future research, can be used by curriculum developers to design materials, pedagogy, and professional development that gain acceptance among instructors.

AB  - To identify and describe the basis upon which instructors make curricular and pedagogical decisions, we have developed an artifact-based interview and an analysis technique based on multilayered concept maps. The policy capturing technique used in the interview asks instructors to make judgments about concrete instructional artifacts similar to those they likely encounter in their teaching environment. The analysis procedure alternatively employs both an a "priori" systems view analysis and an emergent categorization to construct a multilayered concept map, which is a hierarchically arranged set of concept maps where child maps include more details than parent maps. Although our goal was to develop a model of physics faculty beliefs about the teaching and learning of problem solving in the context of an introductory calculus-based physics course, the techniques described here are applicable to a variety of situations in which instructors make decisions that influence teaching and learning.

AB  - Emerging from a human constructivist view of learning and a punctuated model of conceptual change, these studies explored differences in the structural complexity and content validity of knowledge about prehistoric life depicted in concept maps by learners ranging in age from approximately 10 to 20 years. Study 1 (cross-age) explored the frequencies of concepts, relationships, levels of hierarchy, branching, and cross-links in concept maps drawn by students in grades 5, 8, 11, 13, and 14. The results provide some support for a punctuated model of conceptual change. Study 2 (longitudinal) explored the same frequencies on repeated occasions among students enrolled in a college course on prehistoric life, and documented the shift in frequencies of "novice" and "expert" concepts occurring during the semester. The results suggest that college students engage in much restructuring of their knowledge frameworks during the period of a semester. Together, the two studies raise questions about common classroom practices that encourage the rote learning of biology and geology concepts at all levels.

AB  - Digestion of DNA with restriction enzymes, calculation of volumes and concentrations of reagents for reactions, and the separation of DNA fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis are common molecular biology techniques that are best taught through repetition. The following open-ended, investigative laboratory exercise in plasmid restriction mapping allows students to gain technical expertise while simultaneously exploring the utility of gel electrophoresis and restriction mapping. Because of its interpretive nature, this project also provides data suitable for a written report, and can thus be used to reinforce lessons on figure presentation and science writing skills.

AB  - Design is critical to the successful development of any interactive learning environment (ILE). Moreover, in technology-enhanced learning (TEL) the design process requires input from many diverse areas of expertise. As such, anyone undertaking tool development is required to directly address the design challenge from multiple perspectives. We provide a motivation and rationale for design approaches for learning technologies that draws upon Simon's seminal proposition of design science. We then review the application of design experiments and design patterns and argue that a patterns approach has the potential to address many of the critical challenges faced by learning technologists.

AB  - The focus of this paper is on student interpretation and usage of the existence and uniqueness theorems for first-order ordinary differential equations. The inherent structure of the theorems is made explicit by the introduction of a framework of layers concepts-conditions-connectives-conclusions, and we discuss the manners in which students' understanding of these layers construct their perception of the theorems as a whole.

AB  - Inscriptions are central to the practice of science. Previous studies showed, however, that preservice teachers even those with undergraduate degrees in science, generally do not spontaneously produce inscriptions that economically summarize large amounts of data. This study was designed to investigate the production of inscription while a group of 15 graduate-level preservice science teachers engaged in a 15-week course of scientific observation and guided inquiry of two organisms. The course emphasized the production of inscriptions as a way of convincingly supporting claims when the students presented their results. With continuing emphasis on inscriptional representations, we observed a significant increase in the number and type of representations made as the course unfolded. The number of concrete, text-based inscriptions decreased as the number of graphs, tables and other sorts of complex inscriptions increased. As the students moved from purely observational activities to guided inquiry, they made many more transformations of their data into complex and abstract forms, such as graphs and concept maps. The participants' competencies to cross-reference ultimate transformations to initial research questions improved slightly. Our study has implications for the traditional methods by which preservice science teachers are taught in their science classes.

AB  - Change and complexity are creating a need for increasing levels of literacy in science and technology. Presently, we are beginning to provide students with clear contexts in which to learn, including clearly written text, visual displays and maps, and more effective instruction. We are also beginning to give students tools that promote their own literacy by helping them to interact with the learning context. These tools include peer-group skills as well as strategies to analyze text and to indicate comprehension by way of text summaries and concept maps. Even with these tools, more appears to be needed. Disparate backgrounds and languages interfere with the comprehension and the sharing of knowledge. To meet this need, two new tools are proposed. The first tool fractures language ontologically, giving all learners who use it a language to talk about what has, and what has not, been uttered in text or talk about the world. The second fractures language epistemologically, giving those involved in working with text or on the world around them a way to talk about what they have done and what remains to be done. Together, these tools operate as a two- tiered knowledge representation of knowledge. This representation promotes both an individual meta-cognitive and a social meta-cognitive approach to what is known and to what is not known, both ontologically and epistemologically. Two hypotheses guide the presentation: If the tools are taught during early childhood, children will be prepared to master science and technology content. If the tools are used by both students and those who design and deliver instruction, the learning of such content will be accelerated.

AB  - This study looked at 30 primary aged children between 10 and 11 years old who were visiting the Eden Project, Cornwall and participating in workshops led and designed by the Eden Education Officers. The study attempted to directly test the effects of the Education Officers' workshops on children's learning. Personal meaning mapping, a constructivist approach was used to measure change in the children's understanding along four semi-independent dimensions: extent, breadth, depth and mastery. The children's mastery of the subject regardless of ability was improved. Most of the workshop aims, such as "to recognise some plant adaptations in the humid tropics climate" were shown to have been met. The research also highlighted areas to be reviewed, such as educating children about the way indigenous people use plants for their survival and also how children can transfer knowledge, so that they can understand the significance of plants in their own daily lives.

AB  - This paper introduces a concept of differentiability for functions in several variables which has a very natural definition and shares all the properties one expects of a notion of differentiability, but is shown to be weaker than the usual concept of differentiability defined as local linearizability. The exact connection between the two different concepts is exhibited. (Contains 6 figures.)

AB  - This study investigated the effects of using the cooperative concept mapping (CCM) teaching approach on secondary school students' motivation in biology. A non equivalent control group design under the quasi-experimental research was used in which a random sample of four co-educational secondary schools was used. The four schools were randomly assigned to four groups. Each school provided one Form Two class. The study sample comprised of 156 second grade students in the secondary school cycle (Form Two students) in Gucha District, Kenya. Students in all the groups were taught the same biology content but two groups, the experimental groups, were taught using the CCM approach while the other two, the control groups, were taught using regular teaching methods. Two groups, one experimental and one control, were pre-tested prior to the implementation of the CCM intervention. After four weeks, all four groups were post-tested using the students motivation questionnaire (SMQ). Data were analysed using the t-test, ANOVA and ANCOVA. The results show that students exposed to the CCM approach have significantly higher motivation than those taught through regular methods. The results further indicate that there is no statistically significant gender difference in motivation towards the learning of biology among secondary school students exposed to CCM. The researchers conclude that CCM is an effective teaching approach, which biology teachers need to incorporate in their teaching.

AB  - Common examples of graphic organizers include flow diagrams, concept maps, and decision trees. The author has created a novel type of graphic organizer called a decision map. A decision map is a directional heuristic that helps learners solve problems within a generic framework. It incorporates questions that the user must answer and contains conceptual as well as methodological knowledge. The decision map that is presented was created to solve pH problems of varying difficulty that introductory college chemistry students encounter when studying acid-base equilibria. The acid-base decision map was created during an in-class workshop with approximately sixty students enrolled in the second semester of a two-semester introductory chemistry course for science and premedical majors. Questionnaires were used to measure students' perceptions of achievement in regard to problem solving, understanding of concepts, and organization of information as it related to the decision map. Open-ended comments were also solicited to improve the design of the map. After the workshop, the majority of student responses to all of the questions indicated that the decision map helped them solve problems, understand concepts, and organize the material. Furthermore, 78% of the students indicated that they would use the map "sometimes" to "every time" when solving similar acid-base problems. Subsequent students also responded positively to the map when the author replicated the study two additional times and later when another instructor in the same chemistry department performed the workshop and constructed the map. (Contains 2 tables, 4 figures, and 2 notes.)

AB  - Three experiments were conducted to examine the effects of map structure, concept quantification, and focus question on dynamic thinking during a Concept Map (CMap) construction task. The first experiment compared cyclic and hierarchical structures. The second experiment examined the impact of the quantification of the header concept in the map. The third experiment explored the effect of the focus question on the map. For all three experiments, the content of the CMaps was assessed for the number of dynamic propositions and the number of quantified concepts. The results show that the cyclic structure, the quantification of the header concept, and the focus question "How" significantly increased dynamic thinking. The studies, the theoretical background, and the implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Teacher beliefs have become important constructs in educational research with the recognition that beliefs are the best indicators of teachers' planning, decision-making and subsequent classroom behaviour. In this movement many probes and strategies have been employed by researchers for effective data collection and analysis. This paper discusses the need for more reflection-oriented approaches in data collection and analysis in beliefs research. A research project assessing and analyzing beliefs about the nature of science is used as an example of such an approach and each step in data collection and analysis is presented in detail. In addition, this paper also presents an example of how technology (Internet-Mediated-Interviews) can be used in data collection and discusses strengths and shortcomings of this approach.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore teachers' growth in understanding of algebra using concept maps. The study was set in the context of a five-year National Science Foundation funded teacher retention and renewal professional development project. In this project both beginning and experienced teachers are supported as they increase their understanding about mathematics, their ability to implement effective mathematics practices in their classrooms, and their knowledge of working with English Learners. Results indicate that teachers' algebraic knowledge structures became more complex and connected as a result of their professional development. In addition, they were able to adapt their knowledge networks to incorporate important aspects of algebra into them. Concept maps are recommended to other leaders of mathematics professional development as a means of assessing change.

AB  - In 2005, the School of Property, Construction and Project Management at RMIT University, Melbourne, introduced a new curriculum format for all first year students. All students enrolling in one of the four undergraduate degrees offered by the school commenced a common first year programme. This new curriculum was adopted to provide students with a broader depth of knowledge and experience across all study areas and to provide greater skill enhancement for graduates. The common first year university experience allows students to build a multidisciplinary degree based upon their interests and skills. But the common first year has created a number of challenges for the lecturing staff: extremely large classes, space and resourcing issues, assessment and administration problems; greater strains upon technology; and increase in the impersonal nature of the learning environment. This paper examines how one of these large first year classes (construction science) was conducted to address some of the learning issues arising from a common first year. It describes how students were encouraged over the semester to electronically build and create a classroom resource of e-reference material on construction science topics, which was the basis for classroom discussion, interaction and assessment. The result was an electronic reference folder on CD that provided students with both a starting point for assignments, class interaction and assessment, and the development of vital information technology literacy skills.

AB  - This research, conducted with an introductory sociology class at the University of British Columbia during the 2001-2002 academic year, explored community service-learning as a pedagogy and philosophy. The theoretical focus of this paper is Nancy Fraser's (1997) criticisms of Jurgen Habermas' (1992) bourgeois liberal model of the public sphere. We analyzed the class experiences with community service that emerged from students' contributions to a database of community organizations, concept maps, and a student-driven course evaluation. The outcomes of this research include a description of potentially useful course strategies and a narrative of a unique type of community-service learning. (Contains 3 notes and 2 tables.)

AB  - Web-based learning has been proposed as a convenient way to provide professional development experiences. Despite quantitative evidence that online instruction is equivalent to traditional methods (Russell, 2001), the efficiency of this approach has not been extensively studied among teachers. This case report describes learning in an online biology course designed to help teachers prepare for science certification exams. A mixed methodology approach was utilized to analyze the manner in which course participants learned and how the online environment influenced this process. Concept maps scored by two different methods and objective pre- and postcourse examinations were contrasted as representations of assimilated knowledge, while unstructured interviews reflected participants' perceptions of their experiences. Findings indicate that participants experienced gains in declarative knowledge, but little improvement with respect to more complex levels of understanding. Qualitative examination of concept maps demonstrated gaps in participants' understandings of key course ideas. Engagement in the use of online resources varied according to participants' attitudes toward online learning. Subjects also reported a lack of motivation to fully engage in the course due to busy schedules, lack of extrinsic rewards, and the absence of personal accountability.

AB  - The purpose of this research project was to determine the effects of incorporating concept mapping on the achievement of fifth grade students in science class. The study was conducted with twenty-three students at Ata Elementary School, Trabzon, Turkey. The students were tested with teacher-constructed pre- and post tests containing 20 multiple-choice questions. The pupils in the experimental and control groups were exposed to the same teaching techniques covering a unit on heat and temperature. They were given the same pretest after the initial lessons. However, after the pretest, the control group was given a traditional oral review of the material and the experimental group was exposed to the review by the use of Inspiration, which is computer based concept mapping tool. After these reviews, the students on both groups were given the posttest. Test scores were analyzed for any statistically significantly difference in the scores on the test. The results from present study indicate that concept mapping has a noticeable impact on student achievement in science classes. (Contains 5 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Five eighth grade science classes of students in at a middle school were assigned to three treatment groups: those who individually concept mapped, those who collaboratively concept mapped, and those who independently used their study time. The findings revealed that individually generating concept maps on computers during study time positively influenced science concept learning above and beyond independent use of study time, but that collaboratively generating concept maps did not. Students in both individual and collaborative concept mapping groups had positive attitudes toward concept mapping using Inspiration software. However, students in the collaborative concept mapping group did not like working in a group. This study contributes to the limited body of knowledge concerning the comparative effectiveness of individually and collaboratively-generating concept maps on computers for learning.

AB  - This paper is based on a study of how students' read nature in different ecosystems. Its focus is on ecology and the context is outdoors. This literacy has to do with an ability to recognise organisms and relate them to material cycling and energy flow in the specific habitat that is to be read. A teaching sequence was designed in order to develop a class of secondary students' ability to read nature in a forest ecosystem. After instruction they were taken to another ecosystem, a pond where they were asked to read the new environment. The main goal was to follow to what extent they can transfer their understanding from one ecosystem to another. The study is based on recorded interviews, field work, and classroom activities, and it shows the importance of learning general patterns in nature and relating them to functional groups of organisms in an ecosystem.

AB  - This paper reports on a study of ecology teaching and learning in a Swedish primary school class (age 10-11 yrs). A teaching sequence was designed to help students read nature in a river ecosystem. The teaching sequence had a "bottom up" approach, taking as its starting point a common key organism--the freshwater shrimp. From this species and its ecology, the perspective was broadened to involve studies of the interrelations between organisms and finally to the relationship between biotic and abiotic factors. A large part of the instruction took place outdoors. Students were interviewed three times during the course when they were presented with a tray full of objects (both biotic and abiotic) from the ecosystem. The students' task was to name and describe the objects and then to link them up in as many relevant ways as possible, explaining the reasons for the links. The interviews have been transcribed onto concept maps and SOLO-taxonomy was used to illustrate their developing ecological understanding. Results indicate how students related several abstract processes and correlations back to the key organism studied early in the teaching sequence.

AB  - Not all demonstrations involve using exciting visual displays of one or a series of scientific principles. Demonstrations can be as simple as showing the interrelationship between scientific concepts or principles using concept maps. Concepts maps are tools that help people conceptualize and remember a conglomeration of facts making up complex topics or paradigms. They promote creativity and flexibility because they place facts in the construct of the student's learning modality. In this article, the author presents the pattern of organization that concept maps follow. Furthermore, for faculty, the strength of concept map is that it is a simple diagram used to represent words, ideas, tasks, or other items linked to and arranged around a central key word or idea. It is used to generate, visualize, structure, and classify ideas, and as an aid in study, organization, problem solving, and decision making. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Students bring prior knowledge to their learning experiences. This prior knowledge is known to affect how students encode and later retrieve new information learned. Teachers and content developers can use information about students' prior knowledge to create more effective lessons and materials. In many content areas, particularly the sciences, there is extensive research about the conceptions and misconceptions students bring to the learning environment. This research has used tools ranging from instructor and student interviews to written assessments to identify these ideas. In addition, concept maps have been explored as a way to understand how students relate different concepts to each other. A difficulty with concept maps is that there are not good solutions for studying larger groups of students, but also maintaining the detail to see how specific concepts are related. One way to address this is with similarity ratings and the use of the Pathfinder network program. Although there are some areas in which a large amount is known about students' knowledge, there is little understanding of either student or instructor knowledge in the field of computer networking. This paper is a preliminary attempt to explore the knowledge structures of students entering a computer networking class and their instructors using the Pathfinder network methodology. The study participants consisted of 156 students and 12 teachers in 12 different classes, each at a different institution. All of the students were enrolled in the first course (Cisco Certified Networking Associate 1) in the Cisco Networking Academy Program. Students and instructors rated the similarity between pairs of words that represented concepts covered in the course prior to beginning instruction in the course. There were two different groups of words, one representing the course as a whole and one representing a specific chapter. The similarity ratings for these terms were submitted to Pathfinder network analysis, creating both average concept maps for students and instructors as well as measures of the similarity between the maps. Analysis of the maps revealed an instructor map that corresponded to the OSI model, a model of networking. The corresponding student map indicated students did not have this conceptualization of how the theoretical layers of the model work. Instead, students tended to link things that might generalize as equipment, and words that sounded similar. This linking of equipment was further demonstrated in the analysis of concepts from the chapter that introduces basic networking concepts. Whereas instructors exhibited an organization by network type (local or wide-area), the students displayed an equipment-centric organization. The instructor networks provide initial information about how experts organize knowledge in this relatively young field. By understanding some of the ways that students understand concepts prior to instruction, teachers should be better able to focus and tailor instruction. (Contains 2 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - Introductory tertiary level science classes (i.e., at the university or post-compulsory school level) including those for biology face increasing diversity in intake. Previous research has indicated university level teachers assume a certain level of prior knowledge which may or may not be possessed by such students. This report focuses on the use of concept mapping in introductory biology tutorial classes. The research findings suggest that the students found the use of concept mapping enjoyable and that it can enhance meaningful learning for topics that require students to link concepts.

AB  - The research reported in this paper concerns the development of children's skills of interpreting and evaluating evidence in science. Previous studies have shown that school teaching often places limited emphasis on the development of these skills, which are necessary for children to engage in scientific debate and decision-making. The research, undertaken in the United Kingdom, involved four collaborative decision-making activities to stimulate group discussion, each carried out with five groups of four children (10-11 years old). The research shows how the children evaluated evidence for possible choices and judged whether their evidence was sufficient to support a particular conclusion or the rejection of alternative conclusions. A mapping technique was developed to analyse the discussions and identify different "levels" of argumentation. The authors conclude that suitable collaborative activities that focus on the discussion of evidence can be developed to exercise children's ability to argue effectively in making decisions.

AB  - Using a survey and follow-up qualitative research design, an elaborate model of technology integration has been studied in a science education classroom. Using a coding system known as cognotes, teacher-interns were first taught how to recognize electronic discussion contributions consisting specifically of critical approaches such as compare, contrast, cause and effect, inductive and deductive reasoning. An electronic concept map outlining the instructor's consideration of a contentious issue (creationism vs. evolution) was supplied to students. Students further developed concept maps (using Inspiration[R] software) in two ways: (a) students hyperlinked the individual concepts in their map to html-based learning logs and (b) students hyperlinked their own relational phrases between concepts to "captured" electronic discussions. The impact of the instructional approach was assessed through a survey of 68 students, standardized semi-structured interviews, and focus group methodology. Students were especially positive with regard to using a two-dimensional hyperlinked graphic organizer to lend a framework to their understanding of a contentious issue in science education. With regard to electronic discussion, students identified improvements in (a) their ability to formulate arguments, (b) their ability to lead effective discussions, and (c) their ability to substantiate their conceptual frameworks. The technology-integration model described is generic in its application and could be used with a variety of content knowledge. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - This meta-analysis reviews experimental and quasi-experimental studies in which students learned by constructing, modifying, or viewing node-link diagrams. Following an exhaustive search for studies meeting specified design criteria, 67 standardized mean difference effect sizes were extracted from 55 studies involving 5,818 participants. Students at levels ranging from Grade 4 to postsecondary used concept maps to learn in domains such as science, psychology, statistics, and nursing. Posttests measured recall and transfer. Across several instructional conditions, settings, and methodological features, the use of concept maps was associated with increased knowledge retention. Mean effect sizes varied from small to large depending on how concept maps were used and on the type of comparison treatment. Significant heterogeneity was found in most subsets.

AB  - Researching self-regulated learning (SRL) as a process that evolves across multiple episodes of studying poses large methodological challenges. While self-report data provide useful information about learners' perceptions of learning, these data are not reliable indicators of studying tactics learners actually use while studying, especially when learners are young children. We argue that self-reports about SRL need to be augmented by fine-grained traces that are records of learners' actual activities as they study. We describe how gStudy software unobtrusively collects detailed trace data about learners' use of study tactics as they engage with content presented in learning kits--collections of documents (e.g., texts, graphics, video clips) and tasks (e.g., notes, concept maps) on which learners operate to study. We suggest that trace data can advance research about how learners select, monitor, assemble, rehearse, and translate information to learn it, and provide raw materials for mapping SRL and its effects. Examples from the "Life Cycles Learning Kit" that supports grade 1 students learning about the life cycles of humans and frogs are given.

AB  - Nowadays the European Universities are worried about how to adapt higher education to the new European Higher Education Area, as proposed in the Bologna Magna Charta Universitatum of 1998, and signed by 32 European Education Ministers. One of the key points in this higher education reform was the introduction of new Master's level curricula. These Masters will look for the professional specialization and they will have to be adapted to the specific skills demanded by the society. This paper presents the results from a cooperation project--funded by the AECI (International Cooperation Spanish Agency) and developed between the University of Seville (Spain) and the Catholic University of Asuncion (Paraguay)--by about the planning of a new master's level curriculum in digital signal processing (DSP) area, taking into account the Bologna principles and the conclusions obtained by the Career Space Consortium. A scientific method from social science, known as concept mapping techniques, was used to perform this planning. Basically, the idea of concept mapping consists of compiling the opinion from actors belonging to different environments (lecturers, researchers, workers, businessmen, etc.) related to DSP applications. The compiled data were statistically computed to cluster the opinions of the different agents. The result will be a master's level curricula adapted to the environment requirements and the social settings.

AB  - "Real" science is about formulating and trying to solve practical and conceptual problems on the basis of shared beliefs about the world. Scientists build theories and test hypotheses by observation and experiment. They try their best to eliminate personal bias, and are "extremely canny in their acceptance of the claims of others" (Ziman, 2000). In this article the author describes the simple way in which one teacher succeeded in creating a science process in her classroom, with great benefits in terms of learning and engagement for the children. Understanding how she created this process should help teachers grasp the norms of scientific work. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Contemporary assessment practices in science education have undergone significant changes in recent decades. The basis for these changes and the resulting new assessment practices are the subject of this two-part paper. Part 1 considers the basis of assessment that, more than 25 years ago, was driven by the assumptions of decomposability and decontextualization of knowledge, resulting in a low-inference testing system, often described as "traditional." This assessment model was replaced not on account of direct criticism, but rather on account of a larger revolution--the change from behavioral to cognitive psychology, developments in the philosophy of science, and the rise of constructivism. Most notably, the study of the active cognitive processes of the individual resulted in a major emphasis on context in learning and assessment. These changes gave rise to the development of various contextual assessment methodologies in science education, for example, concept mapping assessment, performance assessment, and portfolio assessment. In Part 2, the literature relating to the assessment methods identified in Part 1 is reviewed, revealing that there is not much research that supports their validity and reliability. However, encouraging new work on selected-response tests is forming the basis for reconsideration of past criticisms of this technique. Despite the major developments in contextual assessment methodologies in science education, two important questions remain unanswered, namely, whether grades can be considered as genuine numeric quantities and whether the individual student is the appropriate unit of assessment in public accountability. Given these issues and the requirement for science assessment to satisfy the goals of the individual, the classroom, and the society, tentative recommendations are put forward addressing these parallel needs in the assessment of science learning.

AB  - The study of "zonation", the distribution of plants and animals into distinct spatial areas, is a great way to introduce students to basic ecological concepts. Students can conduct methodical, quantifying surveys of zones in areas as diverse as mudflats, beaches, forests, wetlands, and fields. Students collect data from these areas with field ecology techniques such as transects and quadrats, which allow students to estimate how many different kinds of organisms exist in an area or to describe relative abundance. This article describes a lesson sequence in which students gain an understanding about quantitative sampling techniques and how to effectively evaluate which methods work best for different surveys or in different types of areas. The lesson sequence described in this article can be accomplished within one month as a standalone unit or incorporated into a larger unit of study in ecology. Providing students with an opportunity to conduct scientific work in a field setting is valuable, especially when the experience is connected to ongoing learning. Zonation mapping is an easy and powerful way for students to put their field experience into a larger scientific context, while also providing a concrete example of ecological concepts that is much more relevant to students than an abstract text example could ever be.

AB  - New information and communications technologies and research in cognitive science have led to new ways to think about and implement learning environments. Among these new approaches to instruction and new methods to support learning and performance is an interest in and emphasis on complex subject matter (e.g., complex and dynamic systems involving things such as crisis management, environmental planning, social policy formulation, etc.). Consistent with the notion that learning involves observable changes in abilities, attitudes, beliefs, knowledge, mental models, and skills is the requirement of development methods to assess progress of learning in these complex and ill-structured task domains. A central problem for assessment in complex task domains is determining performance standards on representative tasks against which to measure progress since ordinary problems with single solutions and approved solution approaches are generally not useful. A framework for assessing learning and performance that addresses this issue is presented along with findings from its application in three complex task domains: biology, engineering design and medical diagnosis.

AB  - Educationalists experience difficulties with the construction of competence maps that describe final attainment levels of educational programs. Web-based support was developed with three supportive aids: A construction kit, a phenomenarium, and an information bank. Each supportive aid was expected to improve perceived process and product quality as well as learning. In a full factorial experiment, 266 educational science students constructed a competence map, whether or not supported by different combinations of the three supportive aids. The availability of the construction kit and the phenomenarium had positive effects on perceived process quality and learning. Furthermore, if there was no phenomenarium with example materials, the absence of the construction kit greatly diminished experienced support (i.e., one aspect of process quality); if a phenomenarium was present, the availability of the construction kit had relatively little effect on perceived support. In general, this study indicates that well-designed Web-based support helps to construct competence maps.

Gained results are in favor of convictions that view note taking as an effective learning strategy. At least it was more effective than concept mapping in the experiments of the present study. A possible reason for this is that students benefited from their notes by recapitulating lesson contents whereas concept maps were not used in such a way. This assumption is supported by other experimental evidence that ascribe the advantages of note taking to its function as external memory store that helps students to better process lesson contents.

AB  - In the past two decades, there has been a proliferation of research activities on exploring the use of concept maps to support teaching and learning of various knowledge disciplines which range from science to language subjects. MindNet, which is a collaborative concept mapping environment that supports both synchronous and asynchronous modes of knowledge construction, is a Java-based client/server application with support for browser-based access. This article reports the findings of a study examining the interaction of teachers in a collaborative concept mapping environment. Forty two in-service secondary school teachers studying a postgraduate diploma in education in a local university were selected for this study. The study involved four weeks of the collaborative lesson planning and concept mapping activities. Each group was required to use MindNet as a collaboratively environment to design a set of lesson plans for teaching Pascal Programming. There are evidences from the evaluative study, indicating that the MindNet environment does enhance collaboration among participants. However, it is still early to know how the participants interact with such an environment, and what cognitive and social factors are conducive to effective knowledge co-construction. The researchers suggest that further research on examining the entire process of knowledge construction is necessary. (Contains 3 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess structural knowledge change across a two-week workshop designed to provide high-school teachers with training in Java and Object Oriented Programming. Both before and after the workshop, teachers assigned relatedness ratings to pairs of key concepts regarding Java and Object Oriented Programming. Their ratings were submitted to the Pathfinder network-scaling algorithm, which uses distance estimates to generate an individual's knowledge structure representation composed of nodes that are connected by links. Results showed that significant change in teachers' knowledge structure occurred during the workshop, both in terms of individual teacher networks and their averaged networks. Moreover, these changes were significantly related to performance in the workshop. The results of this study suggest several implications for teaching and assessment in computer science.

AB  - In many countries, an athlete's performance at sporting competitions is often used as part of the selection criteria for entry into college. These criteria could be biased depending upon the procedures utilized by the authorities in a particular country. The purpose of this study was to calibrate, by using the Rasch rating scale model, the judge-based weights associated with the different quality of games. The participants (N = 202) were asked to weight the quality of the gold medal of 10 sports games using a scale ranging from 1 to 100. In this study the judges' weights on the quality of the games differed among the sports games. The Olympic Games had the highest quality measure (logit = 7.69) whereas the National Sport Games had the lowest quality measure (logit = -3.73). The severity level (i.e., a tendency of a judge to rate higher or lower than other judges) was also different among judges, ranging from -6.73 (less severe) to 3.82 (more severe) logits. The results from a Rasch model analysis make it possible for a college board to identify the relative quality of games and to select from high school athletes more objectively.

AB  - This study investigated the score exchangeability of concept maps with problem-solving essays. Of interest was whether sixth-grade students' concept maps predicted their scores on essay responses that used concept map content. Concept maps were hypothesized to be alternatives to performance assessments for content-area domain knowledge in science. Both special (n = 16) and general (n = 16) education students participated in a science unit that covered three ecosystem cycles: (a) the water cycle, (b) the nitrogen cycle, and (c) the carbon dioxide-oxygen cycle. Assessment tasks required students to draw three concept maps and respond to two essay questions. Results showed that concept maps and essay tasks lacked consistent exchangeability. Findings indicated low predictive validity between map scores and essay scores and, thus, maps should not be considered alternative content-area domain assessments. (Contains 2 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - We present a set-theoretic model of the mental representation of classically quantified sentences (All P are Q, Some P are Q, Some P are not Q, and No P are Q). We take inclusion, exclusion, and their negations to be primitive concepts. We show that although these sentences are known to have a diagrammatic expression (in the form of the Gergonne circles) that constitutes a semantic representation, these concepts can also be expressed syntactically in the form of algebraic formulas. We hypothesized that the quantified sentences have an abstract underlying representation common to the formulas and their associated sets of diagrams (models). We derived 9 predictions (3 semantic, 2 pragmatic, and 4 mixed) regarding people's assessment of how well each of the 5 diagrams expresses the meaning of each of the quantified sentences. We report the results from 3 experiments using Gergonne's (1817) circles or an adaptation of Leibniz (1903/1988) lines as external representations and show them to support the predictions.

AB  - This investigation seeks to confirm a computer-based approach that can be used to score concept maps (Poindexter & Clariana, 2004) and then describes the concurrent criterion-related validity of these scores. Participants enrolled in two graduate courses (n=24) were asked to read about and research online the structure and function of the heart and circulatory system, to construct a concept map, and then to write a 250-word essay on this topic. Pathfinder and Latent Semantic Analysis approaches were used to analyze the data. Term agreement with an expert was significantly related to human-rater concept map scores (r 0.75). All of the computer-derived scores were significantly correlated to human-rater essay scores (maximum r = 0.83). These results indicate that automatically derived concept map scores can provide a relatively low-cost, easy to use, and easy to interpret measure of students' science content knowledge.

AB  - This book offers broad, practical strategies for teaching science and engineering courses and describes how faculty can provide a learning environment that helps students comprehend the nature of science, understand science concepts, and solve problems in science courses. The student-centered approach focuses on two main themes: reflective writing and working in collaborative groups. When faculty incorporate methods into their courses that challenge their students to critically reflect, collaborate, and problem solve, students gain a better understanding of science as a connected structure of concepts rather than as a simple tool kit of assorted practices. Topics include: (1) Reflective writing; (2) Writing to learn; (3) Constructing student knowledge; (4) Selected methods for using collaborative groups; (5) Changing students' epistemologies; (6) Training students to solve problems; and (7) Using technology to aid teaching. Following author information, acknowledgments and author note, the book contains ten chapters: (1) Introduction (Teacher-Centered Learning; Road Map of the Book); (2) Reflective Writing (Freewriting; The Bereiter and Scardamalia Model; Objectives of the Reflective Writing Activity; and How to Do Reflective Writing); (3) Writing-to-Learn (Reflective Write-Pair-Share; The Course Dossier Method; and Hosting an End-of-Semester Conference); (4) Constructing Student Knowledge (Students' Intellectual Development; Student Misconceptions; and Critical Thinking); (5) Collaborative Groups (Team Work and Group Projects; Group Development; Roles for Group Members; and Dealing with Dysfunctional Groups); (6) Selected Methods for Using Collaborative Groups (Conceptual Conflict; Overview of the Conceptual Change Experiment; Jigsaw; The Learning Cell; and Collaborative Concept Mapping); (7) Changing Students' Epistemologies (Constructing an Epistemology); (8) Problem Solving (Solving Problems Using Templates Versus Solutions Using Paradigms; Five-Step Method for Solving Problems; and Problem-Solving Strategies); (9) Methods for Training Students to Solve Problems (Writing Their Way Into the Solution; and Collaborative Problem-Solving Groups); and (10) Using the Computer to Aid Teaching (Computer-Assisted Instruction; and Using the Computer to Manage Laboratories). Each chapter also includes a summary. The book concludes with suggested readings, a bibliography, and an index.

AB  - This article explores the synergy that can be created when concept-mapping techniques are used in collaboration with the construction of PowerPoint presentations to increase the richness of the learning experience. Some weaknesses of the typical PowerPoint format are highlighted with a description of how they can be overcome through a more considered approach to both the structure of the presentation and the design of supporting handouts that incorporate ideas taken from the literature on concept mapping. In combination, these complementary tools (concept maps and PowerPoint) might contribute to an epistemologically balanced teaching approach. Reflection upon the revealed diversity of students' views may contribute to lecturers' conceptions of teaching. The possibility of using this to generate an inclusive pedagogy of access within higher education is introduced. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - Concept mapping was investigated as a learning strategy to motivate 82 high-ability, 10th-grade students to take a more meaningful approach to learning biology. The study employed a quasi-experimental, prepost mixed methodology design to assess the relationship between concept-mapping proficiency and changes in motivational and learning strategies use profiles using the Motivated Strategies For Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). The qualitative and quantitative findings suggest a mixed motivational response by learners in taking a more meaningful approach to learning biology using concept mapping. Specifically, the findings revealed that concept mapping may play a supportive role in contributing to a more meaningful approach to learning biology, as indicated by positive and statistically significant effects on students' test performance, as well as adaptive and statistically significant fall-to-spring changes in motivational and learning strategy use profiles in direct relation to the level of mapping proficiency. This dichotomous relationship appears to be a consequence of whether learners' perceive that concept mapping can provide them with a more effective learning strategy than those utilized in the past and, more importantly, upon their willingness to put in the requisite time and effort to develop proficiency in using mapping to take a more self-regulated and meaningful approach to their learning. Thus, it behooves the educator interested in using concept mapping to consider students' receptiveness to using concept mapping and encourage them to perceive the value of becoming sufficiently proficient in its use.

AB  - In this paper, we present two studies designed to help students navigate effectively and learn from a hypertext system, CoMPASS. Our first study ("N" = 74) involved an analysis of students' navigation patterns to group them into clusters, using a "k"-means clustering technique. Based on this analysis, navigation patterns were grouped into four clusters, enabling us to understand the kinds of support that students needed. This formed the basis of our next study, in which we designed and implemented meta-navigation support to help students navigate and learn science content. Support in the form of prompts was provided to one group ("N" = 58) while a second group ("N" = 58) with no support served as the comparison group. Our results suggest that students in the support group performed better on a concept-mapping task. Based on the results we provide suggestions for providing meta-cognitive support in hypertext systems.

AB  - Teaching is a scholarly activity and a life-long learning process with no single method or pedagogy that is always most effective. Applications of teaching pedagogies properly vary from content-based to discipline-based areas. In this paper, various teaching pedagogies, including scaffolding, concept mapping, constructivism, and learning strategies including problem-based learning, collaborative learning, and active learning, is discussed and their applications in effective teaching of undergraduate Computer Science is demonstrated.

AB  - This article examines concepts and propositions from a theoretical perspective, and establishes the need for and develops an extension to Concept Maps (CMaps), called Cyclic Concept Maps (Cyclic CMaps). Cyclic CMaps are considered to be an appropriate tool for representing knowledge of functional or dynamical relationships between concepts. CMaps, on the other hand, are viewed as an appropriate tool for representing hierarchic or static knowledge. The two maps complement each other and collectively capture a larger domain of knowledge, thus forming a more effective knowledge representation tool.

AB  - When one thinks of a "concept map," they usually think of a chartlike graphic that describes a concept and its various relationships, with general concepts at the top, specific supporting concepts toward the bottom, and words and lines showing the connections and flow between the concepts. Some think of concept maps as tools for teachers of upper elementary students--students who have good reading and writing skills. Some do not think of them as something that is appropriate for early childhood learners. This article describes how they can appropriate for early childhood learners.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of conceptual change texts accompanied with concept mapping instruction, compared to traditional instruction (TI), on 8th grade students' understanding of solution concepts and their attitudes toward science as a school subject. Solution Concept Test was developed as a result of examination of related literature and interviews with teachers regarding their observations of students' difficulties. The test was administered to a total of 64 eighth grade students from two classes of a general science course, taught by the same teacher. The experimental group received the conceptual change texts accompanied with concept mapping in a lecture by the teacher. This instruction explicitly dealt with students' misconceptions. It was designed to suggest conditions in which misconceptions could be replaced by scientific conceptions and new conceptions could be integrated with existing conceptions. The control group received TI in which the teacher provided instruction through lecture and discussion methods. The results showed that conceptual change text accompanied with concept mapping instruction caused a significantly better acquisition of scientific conceptions related to solution concept and produced significantly higher positive attitudes toward science as a school subject than the TI. In addition, logical thinking ability and prior learning were strong predictors for the concept learning related to solution.

AB  - Middle school students examine data from the Great Lakes region, assess impact of climate changes, and relate climate and water processes in a concept map. After learning how lake water levels will likely decline, they listen to a story about a grandparent revisiting the lakeshore with a grandchild. In the role of the grandparent and then of the child, they visualize the change in the shore and write their impressions of the science and the impact on society.

AB  - Teaching science in middle school is both rewarding and demanding. Creating an exciting learning environment with a rich science curriculum that engages all students is challenging enough. Monitoring the progress of as many as 150 individual students and knowing that they understand the science concepts we are teaching can be overwhelming. How can teachers know if students develop a coherent and scientific understanding of the important concepts? Is it possible to produce a snapshot of this understanding? In this article the authors address these questions by sharing some practical tips for using concept maps as a way to monitor students understanding.

AB  - Dull classroom environments, poor students' attitudes and inhibited conceptual development led to the creation of an innovative mathematics program, the Class Banking System (CBS), which enables teachers to use constructivist ideas and approaches. To assess the effectiveness of the CBS, the Individualised Classroom Environment Questionnaire (ICEQ), Constructivist Learning Environment Survey (CLES), Test of Mathematics-Related Attitudes (TOMRA), and concept map tests were administered to two groups of fifth-grade students as pretests and posttests over an academic year. To enrich the data collected from those questionnaires, three case studies (one for the experimental group and two for the control group) were undertaken based on observations and interviews of selected students. Relative to non-CBS students, CBS students experienced more favorable changes in terms of mathematics concept development, attitudes to mathematics, and perceived classroom environments on several dimensions of the CLES (e.g., Personal Relevance, Shared Control) and the ICEQ (e.g., Participation and Differentiation). Qualitative information based on classroom observations and student interviews reinforced and enriched the patterns of results obtained from the concept test and questionnaires.

AB  - The purpose of software mapping is to delineate a method for software menu, tool, and palette use in the construction of elementary school science and mathematics curriculum activities. With this method, software "maps" were created for traversing science and math curriculum problems and activities using software. The other purpose of the software mapping efforts is to delineate a method for student assessment in the classroom. Software mapping is an approach to assessment documenting behavioral content in computer interaction. Examples of mapped problems are presented, analyzed, and discussed in this paper.

AB  - The DNA triplet code also functions as a binary code. Because double-ring compounds cannot bind to double-ring compounds in the DNA code, the sequence of bases classified simply as purines or pyrimidines can encode for smaller groups of possible amino acids. This is an intuitive approach to teaching the DNA code. (Contains 6 figures.)

AB  - This paper describes the methods and outcomes of a 12-year longitudinal study into the effects of an early intervention program, while reflecting back on changes that have occurred in approaches to research, learning and instruction since the preliminary inception stages of the study in the mid 1960s. We began the study to challenge the prevailing consensus at the time that primary school children were either "preoperational" or "concrete operational" in their cognitive development and they could not learn abstract concepts. Our early research, based on Ausubelian theory, suggested otherwise. The paper describes the development and implementation of a Grade 1?2 audio tutorial science instructional sequence, and the subsequent tracing over 12 years, of the children's conceptual understandings in science compared to a matched control group. During the study the concept map was developed as a new tool to trace children?s conceptual development. We found that students in the instruction group far outperformed their non-instructed counterparts, and this difference increased as they progressed through middle and high school. The data clearly support the earlier introduction of science instruction on basic science concepts, such as the particulate nature of matter, energy and energy transformations. The data suggest that national curriculum standards for science grossly underestimate the learning capabilities of primary-grade children. The study has helped to lay a foundation for guided instruction using computers and concept mapping that may help both teachers and students become more proficient in understanding science.

AB  - We examine the equivalence of two construct-a-concept-map techniques: construct-a-map with created linking phrases (C), and construct-a-map with selected linking phrases (S). The former places few constraints on the respondent and has been considered the gold standard; the latter is cost and time efficient. Both their products and processes are compared quantitatively and qualitatively as to total accuracy score, individual proposition scores, proposition choice, map structure complexity, proposition generation rate, and proposition generation procedures. We conclude that the two mapping techniques are not equivalent: The C technique is better than the S technique in capturing students' partial knowledge, even though the S can be scored more efficiently than C. Based on their characteristics, if used as an assessment tool, the C technique is more suitable for formative assessment while the S technique is a better fit for large-scale assessments.

AB  - This article looks at how behavioral research can be an effective tool to use during the  redesign process of university plazas. It also summarizes the research that was conducted  at University Union Plaza at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), a 30-year-old plaza that is scheduled to be redesigned. Through the use of behavioral and cognitive mapping techniques, this research illustrates how people react to various design characteristics of the existing plaza and how this affects the way they use the space. The  research was used as a tool to analyze the positive and negative design attributes of the  existing plaza and to provide recommendations for its redesign. The research method described in this article was an effective way for Cal Poly planners to analyze the plaza's  existing design and provides justifiable recommendations for its redesign. This research  has not only been beneficial to planners at Cal Poly but can also be useful for professionals at other university campuses interested in redesigning plazas and communal areas.

AB  - Concept maps are widely used in education, and have been acclaimed for their excellent results. For efficiently using concept maps in education, computer-based concept mapping systems have been developed. However these computer-based concept mapping systems are limited in their assessment algorithms. The assessment takes only concept nodes as the primary basis, with relation links playing only a minor role. To address this problem, this study proposes a new style of concept map, called the weighted concept map, which assigns a weight to each proposition in a concept map to represent its importance. This study proposes a new assessment based on a weighted concept map and diagnosis analysis. Two studies are conducted to evaluate the methods of assessment. (Contains 8 tables and 6 figures.)

AB  - The ability to use the research literature within a given field is a basic skill that students should acquire as part of their higher education studies. However, undergraduates need support in developing this skill. The use of concept maps as an aid to interrogating the literature is described here. This may help students to highlight key issues raised within a research paper, and may be used to demonstrate understanding to their tutors. An example is given by reference to the paper in which James Watson and Francis Crick suggest a structure for DNA. In this, annotated concept maps are used to highlight key issues from the paper from two perspectives: the race to describe the structure of DNA, and the biochemistry of the molecule.

AB  - This article reports the results of an investigation of the convergent criterion-related validity of two computer-based tools for scoring concept maps and essays as part of the ongoing formative evaluation of these tools. In pairs, participants researched a science topic online and created a concept map of the topic. Later, participants individually wrote a short essay from their concept map. The concept maps and essays were scored by the computer-based tools and by human raters using rubrics. Computer-based concept map scores were a very good measure of the qualitative aspects of the concept maps (r = 0.84) and were an adequate measure of the quantitative aspects (r = 0.65). Also, the computer-based essay scores were an adequate measure of essay content (r = 0.71). If computer-based approaches for scoring concept maps and essays can provide a valid, low-cost, easy to use, and easy to interpret measure of students' content knowledge, then these approaches will likely gain rapid acceptance by teachers at all levels.

AB  - This article describes the outcome of an exercise carried out with one hundred undergraduate student teachers (preservice teachers) enrolled in a Biology Teaching Methods course, a third year course in a four-year Teacher Education Programme. The students, working in groups of three to four, were assigned to construct a concept map showing their understanding of a part of the Form Four (grade ten) biology syllabus/curriculum offered in the Malaysian Secondary School System. The concept maps were derived from materials taken from the syllabus, and consisted of scientific concepts as well as the scientific skills and values associated with the chapters and their relationships. The purpose of this assignment was to familiarize the students with the syllabus and to make them understand the scope of the syllabus itself so that these preservice teachers would know what to focus on when they actually teach in the classroom. Through this exercise, not only the students' understanding of the syllabus was revealed but misconceptions among the students on the syllabus and the concept of scientific skills and values were also detected.

AB  - This article presents an overview of measuring science based on a bibliometric methodology. The 2 main lines of this methodology are discussed. First, the measurement of research performance is addressed, including aspects such as interdisciplinarity, collaboration, and knowledge users. It is demonstrated that advanced bibliometric methods are an indispensable element next to peer review in research evaluation procedures, particularly at the level of research groups, university departments, and institutes. Problems involved in the application of bibliometric analysis in the social sciences are discussed. Next, an introduction to the mapping of science is presented, focusing on basic concepts and issues of practical application of science maps. These maps are unique instruments to discover patterns in the structure of scientific fields, to identify processes of knowledge dissemination, and to visualize the dynamics of scientific developments. Their potential for unraveling interdisciplinary developments and interfaces between science and technology is discussed. The article concludes with an indication of the limitations and possible problems of bibliometric analysis. (Contains 3 figures, 1 table and 5 footnotes.)

AB  - This article presents the author's comments on the article by Keith and Ender on sociology's disciplinary core being reflected in introductory sociology textbooks. The author mentions that Keith and Ender claim that if sociology has a disciplinary core, it "would logically be located in the introductory textbook." Furthermore, since a science is supposed to have a conceptual core, Keith and Ender suggest that sociology may not be a science, or at least is not presented as one in introduction to sociology textbooks. The author states that this comment presents evidence that introduction to sociology textbooks are not reflective of published sociological research, and therefore, the contents of these books' glossaries tell readers little about the current state of the discipline. He emphasizes that Keith and Ender are not alone in claiming that introduction to sociology textbooks reflect this field. He argues that introduction to sociology textbooks are a poor reflection of the discipline. (Contains 1 table and 2 footnotes.)

AB  - This experimental study explores how 60 primary-age children's (9-11 years old) understanding of rocks was effected by instruction that used the conceptual structure of the rock cycle together with the analogy of aluminium can recycling. Using a combination of probes into children's understanding, including concept maps and semi-structured interviews, changes to the content of their knowledge (description and classification of rocks) as categorized by membership of particular hierarchical explanatory frameworks (constructed from children's pre-intervention responses), and how such knowledge appears be organized into possible networks of information, are described. Results are then discussed in terms of the impact of the rock cycle, with or without the use of the analogy, on children's existing conceptions, followed by observations on the positive role of the analogy in supporting understanding. In conclusion, the implications for the nature of cognitive change in this domain as revealed by children's explanatory frameworks and the potential value of the aluminium can analogy in supporting children's understanding are addressed.

AB  - This paper presents a generally applicable method for characterizing subjects' hypothesis-testing behaviour based on a synthesis that extends on previous work. Beginning with a transcript of subjects' speech and videotape of their actions, a Reasoning Map is created that depicts the flow of their hypotheses, tests, predictions, results, and conclusions. The methods are described and then applied to a group of three undergraduate biology students testing hypothesis in an inquiry-based laboratory exercise, the Red and White Yeast Lab. Analysis of hypothesis-testing behaviour via Reasoning Maps reveals most of the features explored in previous studies in a unified context. In addition, Reasoning Maps allow analysis of higher-order patterns in hypothesis testing that are not possible using existing methods. We have designed these methods so that they will provide a common language for analysing and understanding hypothesis testing that will allow global comparisons of behaviour.

AB  - This paper reports on a paper and pencil concept-sorting strategy that enables trainee teachers to restructure their knowledge in any one domain of science. It is used as a self-study tool, mainly to enable them to break down and understand the progression of concepts beyond the level at which they have to teach. The strategy involves listing key ideas in an increasingly complex and inclusive fashion such that a 'chain' is developed where the initial statements are simple and the final ones more complex. Evaluation of the strategy with trainees over a five-year period revealed promising potential for the strategy as a self-study tool, as well as an audit tool, enabling tutors to more easily identify misconceptions. There was some evidence that trainees found the strategy useful in preparing themselves to teach in the classroom, possibly by enabling meaningful learning to take place according to the Ausubel-Novak-Gowin theory.

AB  - This article discusses the foundations for the assessment of primary science learning with a focus on the place of assessment in the curriculum, the association between pedagogy and assessment, and the role of formative and summative assessment. Alternative strategies are recommended for the assessment of science learning at primary level, and some important qualities of meaningful assessment are suggested. The use of summative paper and pencil tests in the assessment of science learning is less time consuming and causes little disturbance to teachers or parents, and the results that are reflected in the report cards of pupils are familiar to everyone. However, by using challenging and exciting alternative formative assessment methods, teachers will be able to perceive the development of meaningful modes of inquiry and science understanding by pupils (Lowery, 2000). Moreover, formative assessment has the potential to drive changes in teaching that can improve the conceptual understanding of pupils dramatically, and teachers necessarily must alter the way in which they evaluate this learning and formative assessment to effect this change (Dougherty, 1997). It is thus recommended that both summative assessment and formative assessment should be used in equal measures to periodically evaluate the cumulative understanding and continuing progress of pupils in their learning.

AB  - Preservice teachers studied texts about three fundamentally important science concepts. They read versions with no analogy, versions with a simple analogy, and versions with an elaborate analogy. An elaborate analogy is one that consists of text and pictorial components in which similarities between the analog and the target concept are made explicit. Verbal and imagery processes combine to promote a mapping of conceptual features. The findings indicated that elaborate analogies improved the science knowledge and attitudes of preservice teachers by relating what is familiar to what is new. The findings are consistent with a constructivist view of learning science and suggest that science texts for preservice teachers should be adapted to take advantage of elaborate analogies in a systematic way.

AB  - The search for authentic science research tools to evaluate student understanding in a hybrid learning environment with a large multimedia component has resulted in the use of concept maps as a representation of student's knowledge organization. One hundred and seventy third-semester introductory university-level engineering students represented their understanding related to the atom in a concept map. A qualitative analysis of the data presented a more informative and complete picture of students' understanding as compared with most prominent scoring techniques in the literature. The detailed analysis method is illustrated by means of some students' concept maps and the overall results of the entire student population are discussed. The most striking difference between common and more insightful maps is the inclusion of additional clusters describing models of the atom, beyond the clusters that just describe the elements of atoms (e.g. protons, electrons, etc.) and their characteristics.

AB  - University professors increasingly are expected to infuse computer technology in teaching. Many universities are aggressively promoting the delivery of entire courses and programs using computers and the Internet as vehicles for instruction. There is also a movement to align university teaching with the national standards for K-12 teaching. National and state standards call for K-12 teachers to integrate computer technology in teaching. One way to encourage prospective or experienced teachers to do that is to provide opportunities to experience success using computer technology during preservice and in-service courses. Computer-mediated communication (CMC), or any form of communication that takes place with the use of a personal computer, can be an effective tool for not only infusing technology in an education course, but also for fostering the creation of a community of learners within which the social interaction supporting meaningful learning occurs. This article discusses incorporation of the electronic bulletin board (BB) in science teacher education. As with any course design, there are advantages and disadvantages to incorporating the electronic BB in a course, which are discussed in this article.

AB  - This study examined the effects of concept mapping on the science achievement of middle grade science students. The subjects were 182 eighth-grade students, distributed into eight intact earth science classes by ability levels. The ability level variable also was examined as a possible effect on student achievement. Two teachers were involved in teaching a unit on weather for nine weeks. An objective weather test and six performance assessment items were used to measure achievement. For this group of students, analyses indicated no significant overall effects of treatment on science achievement. A statistically significant effect was found between concept mapping and student achievement among the average students, as measured by combined performance assessment items. The results suggest that the effect of concept mapping on science achievement is not clear, but that lower ability students appear to have better success with concept mapping than higher ability students.

AB  - This study is intended to develop an assessment instrument to investigate students' understandings about internal transport in plants and human circulatory system. A refined process of a two-tier diagnostic test was used to develop the instrument. Finally, three versions of the Internal Transport in Plants and the Human Circulatory System test were developed for different educational levels: elementary, secondary and high school level. The test-retest reliability, the degree of difficulty, and the range of discrimination were found to be reasonable for all three versions. The statistical variances across educational levels of the verification samples and the test applications are discussed. The students' major alternative conceptions on internal transport of plants and human were classified into three attributes of explanations: interconnectedness, language and anthropomorphism. Based on the nature of students' explanations, card-sorting with justification, learning cycle and concept mapping were recommended for in-depth learning of the concept.

AB  - A review of the literature in science education shows that most students have difficulties in hypothetico-deductive reasoning. The author's objective in this study was to investigate the abilities of high school teachers and university teachers to understand the difference between the terms "hypothesis" and "prediction" in the everyday context of Columbus's discovery of America. The author asked 83 high school and university teachers enrolled in a methodology course to elaborate and to explain a prediction and a hypothesis based on Columbus's discovery. Results, based on written responses, showed that most teachers (approximately 60%) did not understand the difference between a hypothesis and a prediction. The author also observed that many teachers did provide a satisfactory description of what they considered to be a hypothesis and a prediction. However, the difficulty for the teachers consisted in operationalizing (elaborating and understanding) the difference between a hypothesis and a prediction. Some teachers explicitly elaborated and classified a prediction as a hypothesis and, at times, the teachers elaborated the two terms in the same manner, without being aware of the contradiction. The study has educational implications by showing that, just like students, teachers have difficulties with the elaboration and understanding of the concepts of hypothesis and prediction. Given the importance of such concepts for all research programs, it is essential that appropriate teaching strategies be implemented. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Many students fail to integrate biological knowledge into larger conceptual frameworks. Although textbooks and lectures in general biology courses emphasize major concepts, when students respond to questions, they often appear to be randomly grasping at disconnected sound bites of biological knowledge. The knowledge they have accumulated does not seem to be connected with concepts in a manner that allows them to develop explanations of phenomena or to use their knowledge to support an argument. The consequences of this approach to science are a reduced ability to retain and apply scientific knowledge, often characterized as a decline in scientific literacy. In this article, the author tested the effectiveness of methods that may contribute to a solution to this crisis in science education. In this experiment, he evaluated the use of cooperative concept mapping to encourage students to incorporate biological information into larger conceptual models. Thus, the results of this study indicate that the processes associated with constructing concept maps in a cooperative learning format improves students' abilities to access information and use it to answer challenging questions.

AB  - In this article, we adopted the relational conceptual change as our theoretical framework to accommodate current views of conceptual change such as ontological beliefs, epistemological commitment, and social/affective contexts commonly mentioned in the literature. We used a specific concept mapping format and process--digraphs and digraphing--as an operational framework for assessing and promoting relational conceptual change. We wanted to find out how concept mapping can be used to account for relational conceptual change. We collected data from a Grade 12 chemistry class using collaborative computerized concept mapping on an ongoing basis during a unit of instruction. Analysis of progressive concept maps and interview transcripts of representative students and the teacher showed that ongoing and collaborative computerized concept mapping is able to account for student conceptual change in ontological, epistemological, and social/affective domains.

AB  - Science content area texts are difficult for most middle school students, particularly whose reading skills are below grade level. This article describes an innovative approach to integrating the teaching of middle school science content and reading skills to increase levels of student success with content area textbooks. For reading instruction, this approach features carefully selected vocabulary, word reading instruction, oral (including partner reading) and silent reading with reading fluency practice as needed, and explicit instruction on comprehension strategies, such as retelling, concept mapping, and summarization. The teaching of the science content incorporates instructional design principles that have been documented to improve comprehension of science content, process skills, and higher order thinking. Six aspects of instructional design that are discussed are the identification and teaching of big ideas, the systematic instruction of vocabulary (including science affixes), a review and integration of core concepts, visual displays of how core concepts are integrated, mnemonics for core concepts, and structured hands-on activities.

AB  - In our study, we focused on the conceptual understanding of the concepts and processes presented in the first lectures of an introductory course in cellular biology for biology majors. The study topic we considered was, "the structure of DNA and the functions of nucleotides". One hundred and eighteen students were asked to prepare concept maps from a list of twenty given concepts. Analysis of these maps has shown a compartmentalization into two major groups of concepts. The most frequent concepts were from the genetic aspect, while frequencies of concepts from the energetic aspect were comparatively low. Many students did not recognize that molecules like ATP or GTP are simply nucleotides. Other interesting misconceptions concerned the concepts of nucleic acids, purines and pyrimidines. One of the advantages of using the concept map technique was that it encouraged the instructor to start using maps as a graphic instructional tool, summarizing his lectures. In addition, the need to select twenty concepts and arrange them in a map forced him to go over his lectures and reconsider whether or not these concepts should have been selected for instruction.

AB  - The power and benefits of concept mapping rest in four arenas: enabling shared understanding, the inclusion of affect, the balance of power, and client involvement. Concept mapping theory and research indicate concept maps (1) are appropriate tools to assist with communication, (2) are easy to use, and (3) are seen as beneficial by their users. An experiment was conducted to test these assertions and analyze the power and benefits of concept mapping using a typical business consulting scenario involving 16 groups of two individuals. The results were analyzed via empirical hypothesis testing and protocol analyses, and indicate an overall support of the theory and prior research and additional support of new measures of usefulness, ease of use, and satisfaction by both parties. A more thorough understanding of concept mapping is gained and available to future practitioners and researchers.

AB  - A major policy objective of the Australian Government is to provide all young people with strong foundations in numeracy. This article reports on a national project coordinated by Deakin University. The project, entitled "Primary numeracy: A mapping, review and analysis of Australian research in numeracy learning at the primary school level," was funded by the Department of Education, Science and Training, under the National Strand of the Numeracy Research and Development Initiative. The project involved analyzing the last decade of Australian research on primary school numeracy, and reviewing it within a broader international context. It involved making research summaries and findings accessible through the development of an indexed electronic database that holds the details of approximately 200 projects and 700 publications. Both this database and the final report were organized using the primary numeracy concept map. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - For centuries traditional university education has primarily focused on building foundational skills in particular disciplines via the transfer of knowledge from instructor to student. Today however, simply being able to reproduce knowledge is no longer adequate; students must also be able to apply their knowledge to changing, real world contexts. By sharing lessons learned and drawing parallels across cultural boundaries, the University of Antwerp, Belgium and the University of Arkansas, USA provide additional insight into how to effectively teach students these skills. Topics that are addressed include: the concepts of powerful learning, interactivity, adequate dialogue, and the post-development evaluation and effective use of e learning environments.

AB  - This paper argues for the integration of metacognitive thinking into the content of school science. It describes the ' metacognitive instances ' approach of implanting metacognitive activities, such as classroom discussions, annotated drawing, keeping diary-like notes and concept-mapping, at selected points of the teaching procedure, in an attempt to extend the durability of children's science understanding, which is often short-lived. The approach was tested with 60 Year 5 pupils in Cyprus studying 'Current Electricity', following a quasiexperimental design with one experimental and one comparative group. Following the teaching of the unit, participants were tested on their understanding of electricity three times in one school year. The research showed that the practice of metacognition is feasible with primary school pupils and that children who experienced situated metacognition retained taught concepts for a longer period of time. Although no significant difference was recorded initially in the amount of subject matter learned by the two groups, children who engaged in metacognitive activities appeared to have achieved more permanent re-structuring of their understandings.

AB  - This study compared the use of paper/pencil and computer tools for creating concept  maps. Participants were 52 students in two combined 9th/10th grade biology classes. An  independent measures research design was used. There were two treatment groups:  computer and paper/pencil. The computer group created concept maps using Inspiration  software on desktop computers. The paper/pencil group made concept maps in the  traditional manner. The t statistic was used to evaluate the mean difference between the  two treatments. The group using the computer created more complex maps than the  group that used paper/pencil. This difference was significant.

AB  - The education of science teachers necessarily involves instruction around the use of computer technologies. Acadia University, a laptop institution, offers a unique setting where students are immersed in the critique of pedagogical applications of computers. The current trend to employ constructivist approaches in teaching provides a backdrop for this article, which offers a discussion of two interactive communication strategies namely asynchronous electronic discussion and negotiative concept mapping. The impacts of these approaches have been addressed with students through surveys and qualitative interviews.

AB  - Student-centered approach of scoring the concept maps consisted of three elements namely symbol system, individual portfolio and scoring scheme. We scored student-constructed concept maps based on 5 concept map criteria: validity of concepts, adequacy of propositions, significance of cross-links, relevancy of examples, and interconnectedness. With respect to the concurrent validity of scoring the concept maps in this study, correlation coefficients were computed between total scores of students' concept map and their scores of Prior Knowledge Test (PKT), and Achievement Test (AT) involved in the concepts of science laboratory experiments. The mean scores of students' pre-lab concept maps correlated much better with their scores of PKT (r= 0.615, p less than 0.01), and also mean scores of students' post-lab concept maps correlated with their scores of Achievement Test (r= 0.478, p less than 0.05). In regard to instructional sensitivity, the statistical analysis based on the comparison of both total and interconnectedness scores of pre- and post-lab concept maps indicated that there were significant differences favoring the post-lab concept maps (p less than 0.01).

AB  - This paper examines the equivalence of two construct-a-concept-map techniques.  construct-a-map with created linking phrases (C) and construct-a-map with selected  linking phrases (S). The former places few constraints on the respondent and has been  considered the gold standard; the latter is cost- and time-efficient. They are compared in terms of both concept map products and processes. Both quantitative and qualitative  variables are used for comparison: total accuracy score, individual proposition scores,  proposition choice, map structure complexity, proposition generation rate, and  proposition generation procedures. It is concluded that the two mapping techniques are  not equivalent: The C mapping technique is better than S in capturing students? partial  knowledge, even though the S mapping technique could be scored more efficiently than  C. Based on the characteristics of the two techniques, if used as an assessment tool, the C mapping technique is suitable for formative assessment, and the S mapping technique is a better fit for large-scale assessments.

AB  - The research focus on children's science has recently shifted from separate concepts to more comprehensive and complex topics. This study addressed pupils' understanding of the complex topic of energy flow and matter cycling. A scoring system with three categories and six concepts was developed and used by four biology teachers to analyze 106 pupils' concept maps. The results indicate that most of the pupils failed to recognize the interrelationships among the various concepts concerned with units of energy flow and matter cycling. It was the relationship between the living world and the non-living world that presented the greatest difficult to understanding. This paper concludes with suggestions for curriculum development and biology teaching. (Contains 5 figures and 4 tables.)

AB  - Concept maps are being used by an increasing number of educators in Europe and the US. This paper has four goals. First, it discusses problems in developing Novak's style concept maps in Turkish caused by linguistic differences between Turkish and English. Second, it reports the findings of a research study conducted to adapt concept maps to Turkish. Third, it recommends three methods for the adaptation resulting from research findings. Finally, it discusses the implications of the adaptation for educators worldwide and for future research. (Contains 6 figures.)

AB  - Research has established that students enter their science classes with ideas about the natural world that do not align with accepted scientific beliefs. The diagnosis of these student preconceptions may be seen as an initial, crucial step in the process of teacher-facilitated conceptual change. So as to capture what science teachers do in their everyday classroom routines to diagnose these student preconceptions, in-depth observations and interviews were conducted with four exemplary secondary science teachers. The teachers' strategies for diagnosing students' preconceptions, their use of information found through diagnosis, and the teachers' understanding of students' preinstructional ideas were all analyzed. The four teachers in this study did not use any formal assessment tools such as pretests, concept maps, interviews, or journal writing to diagnose students' ideas, although they all stated that finding out what students know prior to instruction is important. The teachers all declared that they used questioning to gather information on student ideas but were seen in their classes to rely heavily on low-level, recall questions. One of the teachers, the most experienced, did conduct class discussions where the students were encouraged to express their ideas and preconceptions. The four teachers' understanding of what student preconceptions consist of and the justification for attempting to diagnose these ideas was seen to be weak. The implications of these findings and recommendations for teacher training are made in the article.

AB  - An instructor contemplating a course transformation to incorporate a student-centered learning environment may feel faced with what seems like a high-wire balancing act--a constantly renegotiated compromise between students' legitimate needs for structure, well-understood expectations, and good grades and instructors' foreknowledge that the path to intellectual maturity is "in the doing," particularly if the "doing" presents a reasonable challenge. One of the authors was beginning to lose her balance on the high wire of active learning when she was fortunate to have the opportunity to represent her institution's fledgling problem-based learning (PBL) program at a National Science Foundation-sponsored conference on inquiry approaches to science teaching held at Hampshire College. Her dilemma stemmed in part from the necessity to use the PBL method in one section of a multisectioned, introductory biology course with a common syllabus. Was there room for students to value forging their own path through the content-laden atmosphere of a good PBL problem, or would the specter of the "prescribed sequence of topics" outlined in the common syllabus undercut the value of all but the most direct path? In this article, she shares how she discovered the wonders of concept mapping as an answer to the instructional dilemmas she faced. She discusses the fundamentals of concept mapping and the lessons she learned from using it. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Science teachers seek to increase student learning within the area of science. Through the implementation of National Science Education Standards, teachers are provided insights into learning techniques, strategies, and other guidelines for effective learning instruction. Teachers agree science is a complex discipline, which can be seen in the achievement levels of many middle grade students. This study seeks to examine the use of concept mapping and its effects on the achievement levels of middle school aged students. This type of learning method could improve and facilitate meaningful learning and engage students in extended science discourse, as well as help students construct an understanding of concepts.

AB  - Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have become basic ingredients of, and competitive tools in, the information-intensive tertiary/higher education sector. Their increased and specialised use in teaching and learning, research, academic administration, institutional management and information provision translates into greater access to higher education, flexible and innovative delivery at reduced educational costs, more efficient provision of information services and enhanced educational outcomes. In Library and Information Science (LIS) education, ICTs can represent both the content of courses and essential tools for effective learning of the content. The constant rapid development of these technologies means that LIS curriculum structures and content have to be reorganised, infusing greater ICT knowledge and skills into courses and providing more hands-on practice. African LIS educators recognise the importance of intensifying information technology courses in their curricula to be relevant, visible and competitive in an increasingly globalised and networked world. However, they are often challenged by factors such as technological capacity, funding and sustainability of resources, human expertise and the attitudes of trainers/trainees, higher education bureaucracy and a complicated employment market. Collaborative initiatives and approaches in the implementation of ICT projects are particularly significant because networking, which is the backbone for effective harnessing of ICTs, often transcends departmental, institutional and national jurisdictions.

AB  - The purpose of this research study was to (a) describe how concept mapping can be used as an integral instructional strategy for teaching a college course in evolution, (b) evaluate the utility of incorporating concept mapping in a college course on evolution, (c) determine whether students' concept maps reveal "critical junctures" in learning as the course unfolds, and (d) assess the impact of concept mapping on students' study practices and on students' understanding of course content. Key findings include: (a) Critical junctures in learning evolution can be identified by monitoring the degree of concordance of superordinate concepts appearing on the class set of concept maps submitted after each of the course lectures; (b) students who made concept maps report spending an average of 37% more study time on this college biology course than on their previous biology courses; (c) the use of "seed concept," "micromapping," a standard concept map format, and a standard concept map checklist made the strategy feasible for the instructor to implement and for the student to adopt. A concept map performance index format was also developed for this research study in order to assess students' overall mapping performance. (Contains 6 figures and 4 tables.)

AB  - Many students have difficulty in science because they are passive readers, readers who receive information without understanding. Passive readers begin reading assignments without thinking about the subject. Their counterparts, known as active readers, interact with text to construct meaning. They make predictions, ask questions, generate questions, and vigorously seek answers. For active readers, reading is a means of actively pursuing knowledge. Active readers engage in metacognition, which is an awareness of how they think. Active readers use both pre-reading and during-reading strategies to enhance their comprehension. The following article identifies attributes of passive and active readers, discusses the role of metacognition in reading, and provides pre-reading strategies and during-reading strategies that will help students' transition from passive reading to active reading.

AB  - Noting that effective teaching models that emphasize critical thinking in mathematics and science are used less often in early childhood classrooms than in those for older students, this book provides early childhood educators with an explanation of teaching models that promote 3- to 8-year-olds critical thinking, problem solving, decision making, and cooperative learning through the creative construction of mathematics and science concepts. Chapter 1 reviews how children acquire mathematics and science knowledge, discusses appropriate math and science concepts and science process skills for early childhood, emphasizes the value of critical thinking as children construct knowledge, and includes techniques to integrate mathematics and science concepts. Chapter 2 includes an  adapted Learning Cycle Lesson format called 5E (engagement, exploration, explanation, expansion, and evaluation), provides examples of math and science learning cycle lessons, and discusses the benefits of this lesson format. Chapter 3 discusses Bruner's emphasis on concept attainment through inductive reasoning. This chapter also provides examples of whole-group concept attainment activities, includes suggestions enabling educators to develop their own concept attainment activities, and discusses the benefits of incorporating concept attainment activities into early childhood mathematics and science curriculum. Chapter 4 introduces the Concept Mapping technique, discusses the format for implementing this technique with early childhood-age children, presents examples of concept mapping,  and discusses the benefits of this technique. Chapter 5 summarizes critical thinking models for early childhood-age children, emphasizing the overall benefits of the teaching/learning models and the need to incorporate critical thinking into the early childhood mathematics and science curriculum. Chapters 2 through 4 include sample activities. All but one of the chapters contain references. (KB)

AB  - This paper explores the effect of using concept maps as study tools on achievement in chemistry. Tenth grade students engaged in building concept maps as homework to investigate the correlation between their mastery of concept mapping skills and their achievement in chemistry, and gender differences in using concept mapping as a homework tool. This study provides some insight into the use of concept mapping as a homework tool and provides significant results concerning its different effects on different sex groups where females achieved higher scores than males on chemistry tests, especially on questions at the knowledge and comprehension levels. The results also show that concept mapping helped low achievers achieve higher in chemistry. Students exhibited positive attitudes  toward using concept maps in chemistry. (KHR)

AB  - Recently, the authors engaged in a collaborative inquiry with a sixth grade science class to explore mind mapping, a graphic organizer that can be used to generate ideas, take notes, develop concepts and ideas, and improve memory (Buzan 1979). With a very limited body of research available on how to best use mind maps in the classroom, the authors decided to explore ways mind mapping could be used for the teaching and learning of middle school science. This article reviews research about graphic organizers, describes the ways the authors incorporated mind mapping into a sixth grade science curriculum, and discusses what they learned by using mind mapping as both a teaching and learning strategy.

AB  - This study was conducted to compare effects of concept mapping and conceptual change texts instruction over traditional instruction on 10th grade students' understanding of acid and base concepts. 110 students from 6 classes of a chemistry course taught by the same teacher were enrolled in the study. There were four experimental group classes and two control group classes. Two experimental groups class were instructed with concept mapping instruction; and the other two experimental groups were taught with conceptual change texts instruction and the next two classes were assigned as control group students instructed with traditional instruction. All students were administered the Acids and Bases Concept pre-test and post-test. A two-way ANOVA was used for statistical analyses. The  results showed that concept mapping instruction and the conceptual change texts instruction caused a significantly better acquisition of scientific conceptions related to acids and bases than the traditional instruction. Also, there was no effect of gender difference on understanding of acid and base concepts. (Contains 37 references.) (Author/MM)

AB  - When developing curriculum materials for new contexts, designers feed forward work from similar projects. This customization process must attend to various influences to determine how features from previous efforts will be emphasized and combined. This paper discusses resources and ideas that influenced the design of the RiverWeb Water Quality Simulator (WQS), which has been used in biology and environmental science as well as in a special summer enrichment program emphasizing chemistry. Project staff investigated related materials, including various online notebook strategies and watershed modeling curricula from the University of Michigan. The paper describes how the WQS resulted from the combination of these ideas with the digital watershed concept developed at the National  Center for Supercomputing Applications. Teachers may customize materials to more closely match their circumstances. The customization process for a Web-based simulation dictates a flexible architecture providing direct teacher modification such as addition of notebook questions and reorganization of resource links. In the Maryland Virtual High School Core Models Project, teacher leaders spent countless hours helping teachers do this, developing together, a more robust conceptual and pedagogical framework for the topic. The paper describes the nature of teachers' customization, which often reflected class level and discipline and local environmental features. Appended are computer screen print outs of the following program elements: WQS Map Page; WQS Graph Page: Station 0 Shown; Question  Designated by "Location"; Question for Comparing Sediments within Stations 0 and 2; View of Question List by Teacher; and WQS Concept Map for Environmental Science.

AB  - This study examined what 16 female family and consumer sciences (FCS) preservice teachers learned given 1 instructional environment. Participants were enrolled in three FCS teaching methods and curriculum courses. A 2-hour lesson on classroom management using small group theory was selected. On the first day of class, participants completed questionnaires that examined their background knowledge. They constructed unprompted and prompted concept maps of their understanding of the lesson topic. Two weeks later, the instructor taught the lesson. Researchers made videotapes and field notes about the instructional environment. At the end of the lesson, candidates again constructed unprompted and prompted concept maps. Maps were scored and analyzed. Candidates completed questionnaires  about concepts they had learned and instructional features that helped them learn. They compared their maps and wrote about how their knowledge changed following the instruction. Four candidates completed stimulated recall sessions. Candidates completed a brief assessment 6 weeks later to measure their learning. Candidates' knowledge construction was greatly influenced by stories or cases about which they had much prior knowledge. Experiential learning and multiple opportunities for elaboration on the social plane were important influences on learning. The instructional approach allowed the instructor to access and address students' concerns or goals. (Contains 17 references.) (SM)

T1  - Process and Outcome Studies of Representational Guidance for Scientific Inquiry.

AB  - This paper introduces the concept of representational guidance for collaborative learning discourse and summarizes the results of two studies: a laboratory study investigating differences in discourse process and a classroom study investigating differences in products of the investigations. The laboratory study compared three representational tools for recording and reasoning about evidence during collaborative inquiry. Sixty students from introductory secondary school science classes participated. The tools were unconstrained text (a word processor), graphical evidence mapping, and a matrix or tabular representation. Participants were provided with hypertext-based materials pertinent to a problem in which multiple explanations were proposed for a disease. Analysis of discourse  transcripts was consistent with predictions concerning the amount of talk about evidential relations. The classroom study focused on the effects of representational tools and of assessment rubrics on learning to evaluate diverse sources of empirical evidence and coordinate these data with domain theories. Four high school science classes participated. The representational tools were graphical evidence maps and text. The assessment rubrics provided specific criteria for scientific inquiry, encouraging self-reflection and peer coaching. The results indicate that evidence mapping provides better support than prose, as evidenced by amount of information and quality of inferences recorded in classroom artifacts. The assessment rubrics improved the quality of work of students using the evidence  mapping tool but not those using prose. (Contains 26 references.) (Author/SLD)

AB  - The use of mind mapping (MM), a visual tool developed by T. Buzan (1983; 1996) to improve note-taking, foster creativity, organize thinking, and develop ideas and concepts, was studied in a sixth-grade classroom with 16 students as an instructional and learning tool. In MM, a central focus or graphic representation of the problem is placed in the center of the page, and key words, connected to the central focus with lines, are used to represent ideas. Students perceived MM as an entertaining and interesting approach and thought that MM enhanced their learning. Most students preferred individual MM; some preferred group MM. The teacher enjoyed using MM and thought that it fostered student motivation in learning science. Three appendixes contain a student-generated MM, a chart of  goals and activities for the unit studied, and the survey and interview questions used with students. (Contains 35 references.) (SLD)

AB  - This paper presents preliminary hypotheses about a common core of faculty beliefs about how their students learn to solve problems in their introductory courses. Using a process of structured interviews and a concept map based analysis, we find that faculty appear to believe that students learn problem solving primarily through a process of reflective introspection (educators call this process metacognition) while they practice solving problems and getting assistance from example problem solutions.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine one possible source of misconceptions that are held by students of genetics--the teachers. Is there evidence to suggest that prospective biology teachers might have misconceptions about genetics and related concepts? If prospective biology teachers have misconceptions in genetics, how do these misconceptions relate to common students' misconceptions in genetics? To address these questions a study was conducted at Pennsylvania State University in a secondary science methods course. Data were collected from six prospective biology teachers who had experience with concept mapping prior to this study. The teachers were given a list of concepts and were asked to construct a concept map using those concepts. Maps were analyzed and compared. A  major finding is that concept maps clearly demonstrate that prospective teachers do not have conceptual understanding of concepts and that they are suffering lack of organizational and hierarchial knowledge among these concepts. There is a need for research on teachers' alternative conceptions. Appended are a "Workshop on Concept Mapping with an Introduction to Technology Tools" and a comprehensive concept map.

T1  - ConMap: Investigating New Computer-Based Approaches to Assessing Conceptual Knowledge Structure in Physics.
PY  - 2000/01/01/
N1  - Accession Number: ED462269; Language: English; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Dissertation; Entry Date: 2002
AB  - There is a growing consensus among educational researchers that traditional problem-based assessments are not effective tools for diagnosing a student's knowledge state and for guiding pedagogical intervention, and that new tools grounded in the results of cognitive science research are needed. The ConMap ("Conceptual Mapping") project, described in this dissertation, proposed and investigated some novel methods for assessing the conceptual knowledge structure of physics students. A set of brief computer-administered tasks for eliciting students' conceptual associations was designed. The basic approach of the tasks was to elicit spontaneous term associations from subjects by presenting them with a prompt term, or problem, or topic area, and having them type a set of response  terms. Each response was recorded along with the time spent thinking of and typing it. Several studies were conducted in which data were collected on introductory physics students' performance on the tasks. A detailed statistical description of the data was compiled. Phenomenological characterization of the data (description and statistical summary of observed patterns) provided insight into the way students respond to the task and revealed some notable features to guide modeling efforts. Possible correlations were investigated, some among different aspects of the ConMap data, others between aspects of the data and students' in-course exam scores. Several correlations were found which suggest that the ConMap tasks can successfully reveal information about students' knowledge structuring  and level of expertise. Similarity was observed between data from one of the tasks and results from a traditional concept map task. Two rudimentary quantitative models for the temporal aspects of student performance on one of the tasks were constructed--one based on random probability distributions and the other on a detailed deterministic representation of conceptual knowledge structure. Both models were reasonably successful at approximating the statistical behavior of a typical student's data. (Contains 52 references.) (MM)

AB  - A study examined items selected by preservice teachers for inclusion in an assigned portfolio. Twenty-nine third-year and twenty-eight fourth-year preservice elementary school teachers in a science methods course were asked to complete portfolios that reflected course competencies. Seven items, on average, were selected by each cohort, with 76% of the third-year (winter semester) preservice teachers selecting a group concept map to illustrate the relationship between professional development and teaching standards. Fourth-year (fall semester) students also selected seven items, with lesson plans being the item most often selected. Selections from portfolio comments show the differing approaches of these students. Results show that the assignment of portfolio development allows  preservice science teachers flexibility in documenting their learning. Even when subjects selected the same artifact, the meaning could be quite different. (Contains 2 tables and 13 references.) (SLD)

AB  - A constructivistic learning process was used with primary and secondary students in Genoa, Italy, to approach the problem of the diffusion of the alloctonous algae Caulerpa taxifolia in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Because of the lack of a continuous research program in Italy, the media played a heavy role in the transfer of information to the public, and an incomplete report by media personnel often caused great confusion in readers. To reach a self-made opinion about the Caulerpa case, students discussed all general information they could find. They observed that the opposite information often reported by the media prevented people from understanding the ecological problem and participating in its solution, but the group declared the scientists "must" know the answers to  the problems produced by the exponential diffusion of the species. The learning process supported the disciplinary curriculum of the classes, allowing them to experience the scientific method and to construct knowledge. Discussion of evidence of differences arising from comparison of scientific reprints and the media promoted an awareness learning. Analysis of the concept map prepared by secondary students and the theater script of primary ones verified the positive impact of the process on students' knowledge. Some basic ecological concepts were well understood. (Contains 21 references.) (YLB)

AB  - In the fall of 1997, a senior level course was taught as an interdisciplinary class for learning the processes in food product development. The course implemented many new teaching methods and technologies. It was an effort between two departments: food science and agricultural economics. Students worked in teams with industry mentors who assisted in elaborating on some of the procedures involved in the development process of food products. It was intended to take this class beyond the walls of Penn State University in the fall of 1998 and include other locations. An opportunity arose to link up with students in a food marketing class in St. Joseph's University. This opportunity included finding ways to share resources and involving students with each other. Speakers were shared  and some collaborative work was done during the 1999 year using PictureTel. The classes were scheduled for the same time of day to facilitate cooperation. During the fall semester of 2000, it was decided to take the process a step further and truly integrate the teams for working on projects and assignments. Teams were formed to work together on the course project. There were three different versions of the course. One course was totally integrated. The second version shared the speakers and had some lectures on the off days. The last course was taught traditionally with lecture and few outside speakers or influences. All three used case studies to assist in the learning process. In all three cases, the students were asked to create concept maps and take a mini knowledge test to be used  in the evaluation process of understanding concepts before and after the course. This paper discusses aspects of the fully collaborative, partially collaborative, and traditional courses, as well as the evaluation study that looked at the differences in learning for the different teaching methods.

AB  - This paper examines how conceptions regarding the legitimate purposes and day-to-day course of science influence students' evaluations of science in the popular media. The students involved in this project attend a secondary all-girls school. Their concept of science focused on practical, life-enhancing goals pursued through the complex, time-consuming process of modeling nature. Students used this conception to critically evaluate popular accounts of science. Science and scientists congruent with this image were more admired and trusted than activities and individuals that were not. Their critical ability is thus limited by the limitations of their model of science. Teaching the process and dynamics of scientific activity may help students critically evaluate science. A  Web-based curriculum was used to provide students with notetaking capabilities and concept mapping functions. (Contains 12 references.) (Author/YDS)

AB  - This study investigated the following research questions: (1) Does the use of a shared, intranet environment improve learner problem-solving ability in science? (2) Does the use of a shared, intranet environment increase learner metacognitive reflection? and (3) Do gender differences emerge with the use of a shared, intranet science environment for problem-solving ability and metacognition? A quasi-experimental design randomly assigned 9th and 10th grade biology classes to traditional or shared intranet learning environments. Pilot-test World Wide Web-based distance education software created the simulated intranet learning environment and provided user movement tracking ability, while the visual learning software, Inspiration, was used to generate concept maps and measure  learner metacognitive reflection. A modified ecology curriculum provided contextualization and science content for the shared, intranet and traditional learning environments. This shared, intranet learning environment posed one model which science classrooms can use to create equal opportunity for both genders. Tracking learner movements within a Web-based, science environment has metacognitive as well as problem-solving implications for all learners. (AEF)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of two generative learning strategies, concept maps and manipulation of objects, and to determine if either works better with individual learners or in cooperative learning groups. A total of 80 sixth-grade students in science education were randomly assigned to group or individual conditions and to one of the two experimental treatments. Experimental treatments were changed between first and second post-test. Long-term retention was evaluated with a third and delayed post-test. Students starting with concept maps showed higher achievement on delayed post-test than students beginning with manipulation of objects. No difference was found between students working as individuals or cooperative student teams. Furthermore, a  significant interaction between generative learning strategy and grouping condition was revealed. Implications for sequencing generative learning strategies are discussed. (Author)

AB  - This study explores the impact of a researcher-developed World Wide Web database on a variety of tasks and talk in a science classroom. The study was part of an experienced teacher's action research project designed to increase student engagement in biology class. Lessons were videotaped approximately once a week throughout the entire school year, written materials were collected, and the teacher was interviewed at regular intervals. The teacher employed a wide variety of task designs applying strategies such as concept mapping, group investigation, games and tournaments, and models such as the learning cycle and Driver's 5-stage conceptual teaching model. The teacher-student interactions that evolved from whole-class discussions were found to differ in the ownership of  scientific talk. (Contains 10 references.) (Author/WRM)

AB  - A method to facilitate collaborative learning in complex learning environments was developed and evaluated. Sixteen college students of educational science were given the CoStructure-Tool, a task-specific computer-based tool developed on the basis of concept mapping techniques to support the processes of knowledge construction in collaborative learning. The tool includes concept cards for case information and cards for theoretical concepts, with a screen divided into empirical and theoretical planes. Sixteen other students collaborated without this support in a control condition. Students in both conditions had to work on complex cases in the domain of education. The use of the mapping tool had substantial effects on collaborative knowledge construction. Dyads in this group  produced more on-task contributions and used more theoretical concepts. Use of the mapping tool also facilitated transfer of prior knowledge, but no differences were found in the use of theoretical concepts provided in the learning environment. The CoStructure-Tool proved to be a method for facilitating cooperation that was effective in supporting specific processes and in improving the transfer of prior knowledge.

T1  - Structural Knowledge as a Pre-requisite to Valid Performance Assessment Scores.
PY  - 1999/01/01/
N1  - Accession Number: ED431018; Language: English; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Report; Publication Type: Conference Papers; Entry Date: 1999
AB  - Structural knowledge is a pre-requisite to valid performance assessment scores because structural knowledge leads to better transfer. Better transfer will cause consistency to occur between task performances for a given individual, and this consistency allows for less construct-irrelevant variance and more construct-relevant variance to be present in the scores. This means more valid scores. This paper provides empirical support for each link in this argument. Concept maps are used as representations of the structural knowledge taught in a Political Science I course. Students in that course (approximately 325 students) were assessed using an essay performance assessment. Those students in the concept-mapping condition are shown to write more consistent essays than those who do  not use a concept map while writing. That is, the amount of task-related variance is related to the immediacy of having constructed a concept map. Structural knowledge is, therefore, a pre-requisite to valid performance assessment. (Contains 1 figure, 5 tables, and 88 references.) (Author/SLD)

N1  - Accession Number: ED422378; Language: English; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Report; Publication Type: Conference Papers; Entry Date: 1999
AB  - A concept map is a graph in which the nodes represent concepts, the lines between the nodes represent relations, and the labels on the lines represent the nature of the relations. Concept maps have been used to assess students' knowledge structures, especially in science education. Two concept mapping techniques, constructing a map and filling in a map that has been started were compared to see if the mapping techniques can be considered equivalent, whether the fill-in-the-map techniques are sensitive to the nodes selected to be completed, and whether the fill-in-the-map scores are sensitive to the linking lines selected to be filled-in. Participants were 152 high school chemistry students in 7 classes taught by 2 teachers. On three occasions students constructed or filled in  maps as directed. The fill-in (skeleton) map scores were not sensitive to the sample of nodes or linking lines to be filled in. Fill-in-the-nodes and fill-in-the-lines are not equivalent forms of fill-in-the-map, but further research is needed to determine which of these forms provides more accurate information. Results suggest that both mapping techniques are tapping somewhat similar, but not identical, aspects of students' understanding. Construct-a-map scores more accurately reflect the differences across students' knowledge structures, and the relationship between scores from the multiple-choice test and both mapping techniques confirms that the mapping techniques are not equivalent.

AB  - This paper aims to demonstrate how listening to and discussing the stories inservice science supervisors tell about a novice science teacher provides an opportunity for student science teachers to construct practical knowledge about teaching. Three levels of practical knowledge of teaching are recognized: (1) rules of practice; (2) practical principles; and (3) images. During individual audiotaped interviews, inservice science supervisors were asked to "Tell me a story about a novice science teacher you've supervised." Thirty-two student teachers listened to the stories, discussed them, and then individually wrote what they came to know from the exercise. A list was made of all the student teachers' comments that embodied a rule, principle, or image. The various pieces of  practical knowledge that the student teachers constructed cohered around four themes: the complex nature of teaching; planning and implementing lessons; professional improvement and growth; and the character, personality, and style of a teacher. Contains 20 references. (DDR)

T1  - Learning of Basic Concepts in Informatics Using Collaborative Hypertext: Does Collaborative Hypertext Support Learning as a Whole?
PY  - 1998/01/01/

AB  - This study was conducted to determine whether or not collaborative hypertext affects learning outcomes in the learning of basic concepts in informatics. The researchers organized two university courses about the basics in informatics using collaborative hypertext and two courses without collaborative hypertext. Learning was analyzed, and this paper presents results utilizing the tests of structural knowledge emphasizing learning as a whole. The study found that collaborative hypertext does not improve cognitive learning outcomes in this context. This reflects the need for traditional uncomputerized learning methods at the start of learning informatics or the need to concentrate on improving the truthfulness of a collaborative hypertext-based learning environment. However, the  structural knowledge was learned better than single concepts in the groups using collaborative hypertext. Thus, it is concluded that collaborative hypertext supports learning as a whole compared with learning single facts. Topics discussed include: the nature of learning basic concepts, hypercomposition and collaborative hypertext, the study design, and results. One figure presents a simplified concept map concerning information systems development. (Author/DLS)

T1  - Preservice Secondary Science Teachers' Conceptions of the Nature of Science: By Investigating Their Concept Maps and Final Reflection Paper.

N1  - Accession Number: ED419678; Language: English; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Report; Publication Type: Conference Papers; Entry Date: 1998
AB  - This paper reports on the analysis of concept maps of the nature of science constructed by preservice secondary science teachers during a semester-long reflective process. During the 16-week fall semester of 1996, 17 students were enrolled in a 5-credit course. After analyzing all students' concept maps, students were classified as either good mappers or poor mappers. Two students were selected to investigate conceptual development and change from their initial concept maps to their final reflection paper. These case studies reveal some issues that need to be sorted out, including: (1) students did not revise their concept maps over the semester; (2) the issue of the value of science remained unsettled; (3) students focus more on the instability of scientific knowledge rather  than on its stability; and (4) few students integrate the scientific assumptions discussed in class into their concept maps or papers. These findings have the potential to inform understanding of how to prepare science teachers. Contains 19 references. (DDR)

AB  - This paper reports on the analyses of concept maps on the nature of science constructed by preservice secondary science teachers (N=17) during a semester-long reflective process. Analysis of their electronic journals also provides hierarchical evidence. The research questions explored in this study pertain to determining the views of preservice secondary science teachers about the nature of science, documenting their use of concept mapping and electronic journal writing in exploring concepts related to the nature of science, and finding the kinds of evidence that the preservice science teachers used to support their arguments in the electronic journal writing. Results suggest that students rely frequently on solving a problem for themselves rather than look for evidence from  research, theory, or authority. Also, students generally provide low levels of support for their ideas while carrying on their electronic discussions. Contains 19 references. (DDR)

AB  - This ERIC Digest discusses concept mapping, a technique for representing the structure of information visually. Concept mapping can be used to brainstorm, design complex structures, communicate complex ideas, aid learning by explicitly integrating new and old knowledge, and assess understanding or diagnose misunderstanding. Visual representation has several advantages: (1) visual symbols are quickly and easily recognized; (2) minimum use of text makes it easy to scan for a word, phrase, or general idea; and (3) visual representation allows for development of a holistic understanding that words alone cannot convey. A wide range of computer software for concept mapping is now available for most of the popular computers used in education. Computer support for concept mapping  facilitates ease of adaptation and manipulation, dynamic linking, conversion, communication, and storage. "Inspiration" is currently one of the most popular computer software programs for creating concept maps. (Contains 13 references.) (AEF)

AB  - A concept-map assessment consists of a task that elicits structured knowledge, a response format, and a scoring system. Variation in tasks, response formats, and scoring systems produce different mapping techniques that may elicit different knowledge representations, posing construct-interpretations challenges. This study examined two mapping techniques: (1) students generated the 10 concepts from chemistry to construct a map; and (2) the assessor provided a list of 10 concepts. Two concept-lists were randomly sampled from the domain to examine the effect of concept sampling on map scores. Forty high school students, two teachers, and one expert participated. Results indicate that: (1) the two mapping techniques were statistically equivalent; (2) students' concept-map scores  generalized across samples of concepts; (3) concept maps could be reliably scored, even though they involved complex judgments; and (4) multiple-choice test and concept maps measure somewhat different aspects of science knowledge. Appendixes contain a discussion of compiling the list of concepts, a list of concepts considered for the three conditions, a sample of instructions, and a matrix of the relations between pairs of concepts.

AB  - A study used concept mapping to identify, classify, and prioritize student outcomes for use in building a foundation for evaluating tech prep programs. The study involved 61 stakeholders from 3 stakeholder groups: 24 educators, 18 students, and 19 employers, who rated 98 student outcomes statements gleaned from educational literature on tech prep and school reform. Results showed the three stakeholder groups gave high priority to a wide array of student outcomes, which were clustered into a concept map showing nine clusters, ranked in the following order: (1) personal attributes, attitudes, and employability skills; (2) school-to-work transitions; (3) technology and quality management; (4) information use and decision making; (5) work and interpersonal relationships; (6)  educational attainment; (7) communications; (8) mathematics and science; and (9) democratic and participatory strategies. Educators and students gave higher priority than employers to educational attainment outcomes, whereas employers gave slightly higher priority to vocationally oriented outcomes. The study can be used as a model to investigate other stakeholder groups' attitudes toward tech prep outcomes. (Contains a list of 59 references, and two appendices: student outcomes by classification in the literature, and a comparison of mean rating and bridging values for outcomes statements by cluster and stakeholder group.)

AB  - This feasibility study explored the automated data collection, scoring, and reporting of children's complex problem-solving processes and performance in Web-based information-rich environments. Problem solving was studied using realistic problems in realistic contexts demanding multiple cognitive processes in the domain of environmental science. Sixty-nine middle school and high school students completed pretest and posttest concept maps, a relevant bookmarking measure, and a metacognitive survey. Process data was collected using computer trace data. During posttest map construction students had access to a simulated World Wide Web environment. The relevant bookmarks students used were web documents, specific universal resource locators, that helped students make at least one  meaningful link between two or more concepts. Students were trained in the computer-based concept mapping software and then were given 20 minutes to construct a closed concept map about environmental science. After a tutorial in the bookmark application and the simulated Web environment, students were instructed to search the simulated Web for 40 minutes to help them improve their maps. Data are not complete for all participants due to computer crashes and data log management problems. Student performance from pretest to posttest for concept mapping scores did improve, but more exploratory information seeking behavior did not predict higher scores. Extracting relevant information from the Web resulted in higher final concept mapping scores, but high scores on metacognition did not predict  high scores on the relevant bookmarks and final concept maps. There were no significant results for the use of feedback contributing to higher final concept mapping performance or a greater number of relevant bookmarks. (Contains 43 references.) (SLD)

AB  - In addition to presenting concepts that can help students understand and make decisions about energy issues, this guide provides guidance for teachers to incorporate energy education into their curricula. The guide is divided into two major sections: (1) the Energy Education Conceptual Framework and (2) the Suggested Scope and Sequence. The conceptual framework is not a curriculum in itself; rather, it is a skeleton that provides the foundation for a curriculum. The concepts were derived from energy-related frameworks designed by other educational organizations and taken from physical and environmental science texts. Additional concepts were developed to reflect issues specific to Wisconsin. Concepts within the framework are organized under four themes that are arranged to build  upon each other. Concepts within each theme are further organized into subthemes. Major themes include: (1) We Need Energy, which defines energy and describes how energy is transferred and converted from one form to another according to the laws of thermodynamics; (2) Developing Energy Resources, which addresses energy sources and how humans use energy to meet societal wants and needs through technology; (3) Effects of Energy Resource Development, which covers how using energy resources affects human societies and the environment; and (4) Managing Energy Resource Use, which identifies strategies to help resolve many of the issues presented in the third theme. The section on Scope and Sequence provides guidelines for when and to what extent the energy concepts could be integrated into  school curricula. This guide also contains a concept map, glossary, a 13-item resources and references list, and an appendix of educational objectives. (PVD)

AB  - The Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), collaborating with Policy Studies Associates and a panel of experts in mathematics and science education, has completed a study of states' curriculum frameworks development and standards-setting from 1994. The Council study analyzed the content and quality of state frameworks and standards documents and examined how states are working with local educators on implementation. This report describes the changing landscape of framework development and standards-setting in the United States and identifies emerging issues for practitioners and policy makers. The study was conducted with three kinds of data concerning the current situation of state standards and frameworks in mathematics and science. A concept mapping analysis of all  state curriculum frameworks and standards documents in mathematics and science was completed. In order to identify all current state documents, works in progress, and dissemination and implementation activities, interviews were held with state mathematics and science education specialists. With the aggregated information from these sources, a report that focuses on current and emerging policy issues pertaining to the implementation of standards-based reform in mathematics and science education was developed.

AB  - The consistent reports on gender inequity in science achievement have led to a search for more effective strategies for correcting the imbalance. This study is part of a search which sought to investigate whether or not the cooperative-concept mapping technique improves the science achievement of girls. A non-equivalent control group quasi-experimental design involving three intact groups was adopted. Three schools and 362 Junior Secondary School (JSS) II (equivalent to 8th grade) students in Nnewi Urban, Anambra State of Nigeria constituted the sample. The subjects in each of the three groups were tested before and after treatment which spanned 8 weeks. The Test of Integrated Science Achievement (TISA) was used for data collection. Results showed that the cooperative-concept  mapping strategy significantly improved the achievement of girls in the selected integrated science concepts. Contains 33 references. (Author/JRH)

T1  - The Five Families of Cognitive Learning: A Context in Which To Conduct Cognitive Demands Analyses of Innovative Technologies.

N1  - Accession Number: ED424234; Language: English; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Report; Publication Type: Conference Papers; Entry Date: 1999
AB  - A cognitive demands analysis of a learning technology, a term that includes the hardware and the computer software products that form learning environments, attempts to describe the types of cognitive learning expected of the individual by the technology. This paper explores the context of cognitive learning, suggesting five families of cognitive learning. These families are: (1) content understanding; (2) collaboration; (3) communication; (4) problem solving; and (5) metacognition. Three technologies are analyzed with reference to these types of learning. The first technology, Algebra Tutor, is an intelligent tutoring system to help students learn algebra skills. "Hands-On Universe" is an astronomical research environment for high school students. "Function Machines" is an  application for a visual programming language designed for mathematics and science education. Analyses of the types of learning expected for each of these technologies have resulted in the development of a suite of performance tasks (an integrated simulation) that includes individual and collaborative concept mapping tasks, a problem-solving search task, an explanation task, and a metacognitive questionnaire. This assessment environment is integrated across grade levels and within content areas to blend real-world tasks with a project-based scenario that captures many types of cognitive learning.

AB  - This paper is based on the belief that knowledge must be organized in order to be accessible from long term memory and this kind of organization requires connected understanding. It reports on the development and validity of the select-and-fill-in concept map format designed to measure middle school students' connected understanding of selected science concepts and processes. The validity concerns discussed are related to map assessment content, cognitive processes required to complete the map assessment tasks, technical quality, and relationships of map scores and patterns of map scores to those from other assessment measures. Phase I included development and field testing of a variety of possible mapping formats. Phase II involved the creation, field testing, and revision of  the most promising, the select-and-fill-in concept map, into its final form. In Phase III the format was tested with ethnically diverse middle school science students. Findings indicate that the select-and-fill-in concept map format can be used with ethnically diverse middle school students to measure their connected understanding of science. Contains 23 references. (Author/JRH)

AB  - The main author of this paper (J.W.) wrote the original as two separate essays for a Bachelor of Education unit at Northern Territory University (The Teaching of Science: EBE 483) for the second author (B.P.). This unit contains as a major component student/teacher research on children's ideas (misconceptions) in science. This paper seems very worthwhile to me (B.P.) as it deals with content (the solar cell) that I have not seen described elsewhere in the research. No listing of research in this area is apparent in recent bibliographies (Pfundt & Duit, 1994; Driver et al, 1995). It is also in keeping with current ideas in the Northern Territory on introducing technology into education at the primary level. The paper continues a series of papers on children's ideas in science that relate to the Northern Territory. (Isaacs, 1992; Palmer, 1993; Gavin 1994; Bonazinga, 1995). Appended are: (1) Concept maps.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of two different types of post-instruction concept interviews: one that did and one that did not embed a concept mapping process as means of eliciting students' post-instruction conceptual understandings about the nature of, source of, and problems caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The study also tried to determine any effect by the addition of the independent variable, student to expert Pathfinder Network Similarity Index (PFNSI) on the prediction of the criterion measure of accordance (ACCORD). The study also sought to elicit students' perceptions of the process instituted in the interviews to determine what they know. Data was collected from eighth grade physical science students and their teacher using  open-ended interviews. Findings indicate an interview that embedded a concept mapping process (compared to an interview that excluded this process) did not affect statistically significant changes in the externalization of students' conceptual understandings. Another finding was that PFNSI had predictive validity for performance in the interview on the measure of ACCORD and proved to be a reliable confirmatory measure of the degree to which students held an ideal post-instructional understanding.

AB  - Eight physical science textbooks were analyzed for coverage on acids, bases, and neutralization. At the level of the text, clarity and coherence of statements were investigated. The conceptual framework for this topic was represented in a concept map which was used as a coding tool for tracing concepts and links present in textbooks. Cognitive demands placed by the textbooks on the reader were considered. Results indicated that although textbooks are readable, they fail in making explicit connections to important, underlying themes such as chemical change and physical properties. Cognitive demands placed on the reader include concurrent spatial and proportional reasoning. Furthermore, results suggest that conceptual frameworks which the students are exposed to in textbooks might  be deficient not only in terms of content but also in terms of how content is weaved into a broader framework.

AB  - Concept maps have been used successfully in science and mathematics education in a variety of settings. This paper describes the application of the metacognitive tool, concept mapping, to the development of an integrated veterinary curriculum, to the development of case-based exercises for problem-based learning, and as a learning tool for students working individually or in small groups. Examples are drawn from courses developed for a new veterinary curriculum implemented in 1993. Special attention is paid to a course taught to 65 veterinary students in the spring of 1995 on fluid and electrolyte disorders. Concept maps were integral to the design and delivery of the course, and were included in the final examination. The use of concept maps to this extent was well received by  students. The vast majority claimed that the concept maps greatly facilitated their understanding of the relevant pathophysiologic mechanisms contributing to an acid/base disturbance or fluid disorder. Responses from the faculty involved with the course were also very positive. It is argued that concept maps can help make conceptual relationships explicit, identify errors and omissions, and reveal misconceptions in students' understanding.

AB  - A pilot study to investigate the use of concept mapping for assessment purposes was conducted during the spring of 1996. Thirteen teachers from a random sample of science teachers affiliated with the Iowa-Scope, Sequence, and Coordination Project and 12 other teachers affiliated with the project participated in the concept mapping study. Student concept maps were scored by the participating teachers using the "Expert Science Teaching Educational Evaluation Model (ESTEEM) Concept Mapping Scoring Rubric." Even with attempts to standardize implementation of the concept mapping procedures, teachers had a tendency to divert from the pre-established guidelines. Concept mapping can be used for a diverse set of topics and issues and can be used across grade levels. Even with the use of a  rubric, scoring concept maps is a subjective process. In addition to quantitative analyses of concept maps, qualitative inspection can provide evidence of misconceptions and growth in student understanding. Since concept maps are a personal construction of understanding, a concept map would seem to warrant a personal, in-depth look. Numerous variables such as skill level with concept mapping, concept difficulty, different classrooms, and scoring of the maps are factors that make interpretation of data problematic. An appendix presents a figure illustrating the use of concept maps in student assessment. (Contains one figure, one appendix figure, one table, and six references.) (Author/SLD)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether hemisphericity and learning type are related to concept mapping attributes of preservice and inservice teachers. In addition, differences in concept mapping by program (i.e., preservice elementary/middle school and secondary science teachers and inservice elementary/middle school teachers), learning type, and hemisphericity were investigated. Hemisphericity and learning type were measured by the Hemispheric Mode Indicator and 4MAT Learning Type Measure respectively. Concept maps were constructed by the teachers and scored on a seven attribute rubric. Statistically significant intercorrelations were found between hemisphericity and learning type as well as between the attributes within the concept maps. However, concept mapping  attributes did not correlate significantly with hemisphericity and learning type. The ANOVA (Analysis Of Variance) indicated that the inservice elementary/middle school teachers performed significantly better in concept mapping than the preservice elementary/middle school and secondary science teachers.

AB  - This document features the experiences of three science teachers who video and audiotaped classroom proceedings in order to go back over what was said in classroom events, to explore the intentions and ideas that were perhaps not fully understood at the time. Mary DiSchino, who teaches 3rd and 4th graders, teaches a science curriculum which she organizes around questions her students ask about the world. She tells the story of her students' investigation of one question, "Why do bees sting and why do they die afterwards?" Laura Sylvan has searched for ways to introduce "authentic" discussion into her 7th and 8th grade science classroom, discussion in which students are both respectful and genuinely engaged. She presents two discussions which she felt were particularly fruitful  and explores what the students were saying and what she learned about them from their talk. Chris Whitbeck, who teaches middle-school science, describes an investigation he did with four students from his class on how bicycles work; he explores the deeper view he gained on how the students thought about bicycles and on what experiences influenced their thinking.

AB  - This Dwight D. Eisenhower Mathematics and Science Education in-service project in northwest Indiana, based on a contextual constructivist perspective, sought to enhance science learning by improving science teaching in grades K-8. Elementary and middle school teachers from urban, suburban, and rural public and parochial schools attended a summer workshop in which they engaged in activity-based science learning; participated in exercises in cooperative planning, science concept enrichment, process skills development, and relevant computer applications; and discussed options for interdisciplinary science learning. After school began, the teachers attended assessment training workshops during which they developed pre- and post-test instruments for evaluating student science  learning. Lesson plans developed during the summer workshop were implemented during the school year, and assessment instruments were submitted, including journals, data record sheets, notebook entries, charting and graphing, laboratory techniques and reports, written tests and concept mapping, observations and oral exchange, and drawings and art projects. Nearly all teacher reported improved student attitudes and science learning among the 1,772 project students. Project results underscore the value of teacher-prepared multiple assessment measures for equitable and realistic evaluation of science learning. (NAV)

AB  - This study investigates student world views in an effort to provide information that will improve the learning environment of the science classroom. The research focuses on furthering knowledge of students as people in the context of investigating what students think about nature or the natural world. The objective of the descriptive case study is to come to a better understanding of the cognitive culture of 16 ninth graders from a semi-rural high school in the central desert region of Arizona. A modified naturalistic inquiry approach using a semi-structure interview technique was employed. A number of assertions are examined relating to variations in views of the natural world based on differing perspectives, gender, religion, integration of school science in everyday thinking,  science grade success, and environmental awareness. Implications for further research and instructional improvement are discussed. Results show that student ideas are often both rich and rational. Yet within the richness of student comments little pertained to science, and only one student's conceptualization of nature reasonably matched the naturalistic-mechanistic view of nature common to science education. An appendix provides concept maps and narrative transcripts. Contains 49 references. (LZ)

AB  - A new problem-based course in molecular biology, genetics, and cancer for first-year veterinary students was developed at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University (New York). The course was developed out of a desire to foster student-centered and lifelong learning and to integrate basic and clinical science knowledge despite a lack of established hierarchies or authoritative texts. The course was first offered in 1993 using problem-based methods and was organized around seven case scenarios intended to be investigated by 14 six-person groups each working with one faculty member. Though faculty were pleased with the course outcome, students expressed a need for greater clarity on course structure and difficulty locating resource material. Minor course design  changes were made and the second iteration of the course was better received by students. Student performance did not change but students' perception about what they learned and how it related to veterinary medicine was more positive. The improved student attitudes are attributed to a better "fit" between the implicit and explicit structure of the course. The importance of monitoring the quality of students' learning is discussed as is the role of concept maps for structuring and assessing understanding. (Contains 14 references.) (JB)

AB  - The cognitive revolution began in the 1950s as researchers began to move away from the study of knowledge acquisition and behaviorism to the study of information and the way it is processed. Four factors are discussed in chapter 1 as contributing to the increase in popularity of the "cognitive revolution" (increasing enthusiasm for the cognitive approach). This historical perspective on cognitive psychology includes an examination of cognition as a constructive process, structuralism, functionalism, the association approach to memory, Hermann Ebbinghaus, and measuring retention. Some basic characteristics of memory are also explained. Chapter 2 examines the processing of information. A discussion of the structure of memory includes sensory register, short-term ("working") memory,  and long-term memory. A section on mnemonics outlines strategies such as the methods of places, association, and keyword. The nature of forgetting and memory interference are also discussed. Chapter 3 examines representations of knowledge, including network models of long-term memory; procedural and metacognitive knowledge; the conditions of learning; concepts; prototypes; schemata; scripts; and goals and plans. Graphic representations of knowledge are explored in chapter 4. An introduction to concept mapping is offered, and hypermedia and hypertext are examined in depth. Chapter 5 discusses problem solving in terms of behaviorism, Gestaltism, information processing, solution paths. Methods of problem solving are highlighted: random search strategies, heuristic search strategies,  proximity search, means-end analysis, pattern matching, and domain-specific problem solving. Artificial intelligence and expert systems are covered in chapter 6. Chapter 7 explores the history of education and educational media. (Contains 153 references.) (MAS)

AB  - The research described in this paper investigates the use of portfolio assessment techniques in middle school science classrooms. It explores how alternative assessment frameworks, such as portfolios, can be used by the classroom teacher and the students as an indicator of students' conceptual understanding and to facilitate changes in science learning environments where learners' development is promoted in the domains of epistemic, cognitive, and social goals. Interviews using the SEPIA (Science Education through Portfolio Instruction and Assessment) Student Interview, were conducted with 29 sixth-grade students selected from classes of 6 teachers in 5 schools in the same urban school district. The purpose of the interview was to develop a profile of students' conceptual  understanding with respect to flotation and buoyancy; this understanding was assessed with respect to the three domains established within the conceptual framework of the lesson unit. Transcribed tapes were coded by use of concept maps which are an integral part of instruction. Results indicate that students' conceptual understanding of flotation and buoyancy in terms of operating forces was well established although relation to the underlying explanation in terms of water pressure and design features were underemphasized. A high percentage of students focused on vessel performance in water. Students' use of their portfolios during the interview suggest that certain portfolio items might be critical in bringing about effective instruction and assessment. Appendixes provide: The SEPIA  Student Interview and Storyboards; concept maps; samples of student work; and forecast portfolio item. (Contains 17 references.) (ND)

AB  - A longitudinal case study was conducted to explore changes in how beginning science teachers conceptualize science teaching. The current study explored the development of two of these teachers who were chosen because of their contrasting levels of expertise after their first semester of independent teaching. The research was designed to elicit the participants' personal beliefs about science teaching and science teachers. Three data collection methods, concept mapping, a repertory grid interview technique and stimulated recall interviews were used to allow triangulation. Data were collected as early as possible in the preservice year, at the end of that year and after one and three semesters of independent teaching. The initial stimulated recall interview for each participant  occurred during the first continuous 3-week teaching experience. Findings raised questions about possible implications for selection, preservice education, and induction of science teachers to enhance the quality of the contribution of new members of the profession. Appendixes show the frequencies of comments in different categories in each stimulated recall interview, the focused forms of each repertory grid, and concept maps drawn at each stage.

AB  - This paper reports on an integration of concept mapping for manipulating and structuring knowledge with multimedia presentation technology. The intelligent hypermedia system HAN (hypermedia activated network) is an authoring environment that generates small hypermedia tutorials online as they are required. A student query activates a portion of a semantic network representing the key concepts of a domain of a HAN module. The activated portion of the network and a simple model of the student are used by the system to construct a small mapped hypertext which can then be explored by the student. The HAN system combines hypermedia material for the authoring and tutorial interface provided by Apple's HyperCard with a core semantic network management system implemented in Logic  Programming Associates' MacProlog. These systems communicate via Apple's Apple Event interface. Following an evaluation of the use of this system to teach second-year students of architecture at University of Sheffield (England), the authoring and inference aspects of the system were substantially improved. The system is now being extended to demonstrate the support of some aspects of cognitive science and psychology. The HAN system integrates artificial intelligence and flexible learning techniques in a dual-platform experiment with hypertext and semantic network architectures. (AEF)

T1  - The Validity and Reliability of Concept Mapping as an Alternative Science Assessment when Item Response Theory Is Used for Scoring.
PY  - 1994/01/01/
N1  - Accession Number: ED370992; Language: English; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Report; Publication Type: Conference Papers; Entry Date: 1994
AB  - Problems of validity and reliability of concept mapping are addressed by using item-response theory (IRT) models for scoring. In this study, the overall structure of students' concept maps are defined by the number of links, the number of hierarchies, the number of cross-links, and the number of examples. The study was conducted with 92 students in four classes at a junior high school in Canada. Results show that IRT scoring of concept maps is generally valid and reliable. The correlation between IRT ability estimates and the total concept-mapping scores based on a scoring scheme proposed by J. D. Novak is significant, demonstrating that it is valid to score concept maps on the basis of structural characteristics defined by links, hierarchies, cross-links, and examples. The  advantage of IRT scoring is reliability. Some computer packages with concept-mapping facilities and IRT scoring are described. One figure and eight tables present study findings.

AB  - A number of strategies, informed by science education research, have been identified to assist the understanding and communication of difficult concepts in science. A teacher's craft lies in creating learning experiences that facilitate concept development and challenge misconceptions from which students actively build, modify, and extend their conceptual understanding. Concept mapping is accepted as one of several research and evaluation tools that are valid devices for assessing conceptual change. Concept mapping has also been identified by teachers and researchers as a tool for assisting teachers to organize their teaching strategies. Conceptual understanding is influenced by the prior knowledge brought by students to learning situations. Effective teaching entails recognizing  students' prior knowledge including any alternative frameworks and adopting teaching strategies to acknowledge those frameworks. Scientific facts, if learned in a meaningful, rather than rote, manner produce much in students' minds. Having identified their students' prior learning, educators are then faced with the challenge of creating learning experiences to facilitate meaningful learning and conceptual understanding. Meaningful communication of concepts can be taught through the use of contexts and case studies; discrepant events (when a mismatch exists between the preconceptions that students bring to a learning situation); analogies, metaphors, and similes; examples and non-examples; and multiple representations of verbal and nonverbal information. Four tables and two figures  illustrating aspects of the various teaching methods are included. (Contains 36 references.) (RS)

AB  - Assessment of student performance is emerging as a crucial ingredient in the recipe for ongoing improvement of school science. This digest focuses on assessment in the service of instruction, for helping students, teachers, and parents monitor learning. According to M. Jorgensen, performance-based assessment requires that the student demonstrate, or perform the actual behavior of interest. Other forms of alternative assessment include concept mapping, journal writing, scoring rubrics to monitor skill development, and the use of portfolios documenting student accomplishments. A first step in considering assessment methods is to become familiar with the wide range of student outcomes that are being endorsed by science teachers, scientists, and the National Research Council.  Drawbacks of performance assessments are noted: staff development resources are required, the assessments take more time than conventional methods, standardization is difficult, and the results may not be generalizable from one context to another.

AB  - This paper discusses the development of concept maps for an entire veterinary curriculum, for each of the planned courses, and for each of the case-based exercises in each course, drawing on current efforts at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University (Ithaca, New York) to develop an integrated curriculum for use in a problem-based format. Increased use of problem-based approaches to medical education has highlighted the challenges of curricular revision and interdisciplinary development. Venturing beyond disciplinary boundaries can be difficult, despite a desire to create interdisciplinary courses and adopt new ways of teaching. Concept mapping is an effective tool for developing an integrated curriculum. Examples are given of concept maps that represent an entire  veterinary curriculum, specific courses, and case-based exercises. It is argued that concept mapping is a valuable tool for curriculum development of any scope or discipline, but is particularly helpful for creating interdisciplinary courses and case-based exercises. Nine figures illustrate concept maps. (Author/SLD)

AB  - A year-long study in 1991 that aimed to develop self-assessment skills in one third-grade class in Australia is reported. The roles that the length and naturalistic features of the study played in the success of skill development are explored. The class contained 20 students, ages 8-9 years, present for the whole school year (four 11-week terms). Selecting a specific curriculum area made planning and post-teaching reflection more manageable for the teacher. Science and technology was chosen for teacher interest and its congruence with the research aims. A self-assessment questionnaire was developed early in the year, based on ideas that students had about the skills they needed in science and technology. Students were introduced to concept maps and learned to produce them.  Additional self-assessment was recorded in self-assessment graphs created by students. Specific self-assessment concepts and techniques introduced during each term are detailed. Students accepted the self-assessment tasks as teaching and learning strategies in their own right. Student awareness and use of skills in these class activities were substantially enhanced. The teacher's role changed as students became more proficient at self-assessment, until the teacher was functioning as a delegator, rather than as a dominating instructor. Nine figures illustrate student's concepts and list statements used in self-assessment questionnaires. (SLD)

AB  - To analyze a student's conceptual changes, analyzing transcriptions of writing and verbal statements may not provide enough information. In a study of 25 sixth graders learning about matter and molecules, concept mapping of students' stated ideas was used to analyze the kinds of organizational changes the students made to use new science information. Mapping student statements across time should provide insight into the ways they restructure knowledge. Methodology used and findings are reported for 2 of the 25 students as they studied matter and molecules. Interviews, student writings, transcripts of their remarks, and observations of classroom instruction were used to make the concept maps. Maps were constructed by placing each concept in a circle and connecting the circles as  concepts were mentioned. Comparing the maps over time reflected changes in student thinking. With the aid of instruction, students organized their information more usefully and their maps became more organized, with more hierarchical levels.

T1  - On Concept Maps as Potential "Authentic" Assessments in Science. Indirect Approaches to Knowledge Representation of High School Science.
PY  - 1993/01/01/
N1  - Accession Number: ED367691; Language: English; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Report; Entry Date: 1994
AB  - One potential approach to the authentic assessment of what students know and can do in science is concept mapping. A concept map is a graph consisting of nodes representing concepts and labeled lines denoting the relation between a pair of nodes (concepts). The external concept map constructed by the student is interpreted as representing important aspects of the organization of concepts in that student's memory (cognitive structure). This review of the literature found that concept mapping techniques varied widely, with no less than 128 possible variations identified. Methods for scoring maps varied almost as widely. The review leads to the conclusion that an integrative, working cognitive theory is needed to begin to limit this variation for assessment purposes and to serve as  a basis for psychometric studies of the reliability (generalizability) and construct validity of concept maps. Other issues arising from large-scale use of mapping techniques are explored, including the importance of students' familiarity with and skills in using concept maps and the possible negative impact of teachers teaching to the assessment, thus requiring students to memorize concept maps provided by textbooks or themselves. Ten figures and two tables present review findings. (Contains 41 references.) (Author/SLD)

T1  - The Constructivist Transformation of a Preservice Teacher's Views on Teaching Creationism and Evolution.
PY  - 1993/01/01/
N1  - Accession Number: ED361210; Language: English; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Report; Publication Type: Conference Papers; Entry Date: 1994
AB  - Students enter teacher education programs with pre-existing beliefs about the teacher's role, what constitutes effective teaching, teacher planning, and knowledge structures. This case study examines the changes in one preservice science teacher's attitude and beliefs towards the teaching of creationism as a result of her personal inquiry. The student was a female, 28-year-old nontraditional student, enrolled in the undergraduate introductory course of a 2-year secondary education course of study at an urban southwestern state university. Data was collected from a questionnaire, early microteaching lessons, concept maps of teaching, reflective papers, student learning journals, interviews, and a field paper of an in-depth personal inquiry into the teaching of creationism.  Findings indicated that as a result of her personal investigation, the student changed her beliefs about the teaching of the origin of life in the science classroom. The paper concludes that teacher educators can invite critical inquiry into attitudes and beliefs about teaching and prepare teachers with sound rationales for teaching, if their views about what to teach and how to teach are tested from a constructivist approach. Contains 17 references. (MDH)

AB  - This curriculum consists of a Teacher's Guide and a series of 12 instructional modules, that are centered around concepts important in the study of national resource science. The modules are designed to supplement textbooks with activities for students in primary and middle grades (K-8). The titles of the modules are: (1) Natural History of a Tree; (2) Soils and Plant Growth; (3) The Water Cycle; (4) Recipe for Tree Growth; (5) Tree Growth and the Environment; (6) Appreciation of Natural Beauty; (7) Forest Processes; (8) Growth of a Forest; (9) Interactions of Forest Plants and Animals; (10) Managing Our Forest Resources; (11) Natural Watersheds; (12) Managing Our Natural Resources. The materials are designed to address concerns with the environment and stewardship of the planet  via teaching of higher order thought processes, and fostering meaningful learning. The instructional sequence uses the learning cycle approach to teaching. For each module the three phases of the learning cycle are specified: exploration phase, wherein students explore new ideas with minimal expectation of specific accomplishment; the inventing an idea phase, during which the new idea or skill is formally introduced; and the expansion phase, which provides practice and transfer situations. The following information is provided for each module: background information, objectives, three learning phases, evaluation, glossary and figures for transparencies, student handouts and concept maps.

N1  - Accession Number: ED354144; Language: English; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Report; Publication Type: Conference Papers; Entry Date: 1993
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to update the review of science-related reading research conducted by Yore and Shymansky (1985) and to provide a current research foundation for a science reading research agenda. This review emphasizes the post-1985 literature and selected pre-1985 literature not included in the earlier summary. This summary addresses the interactive-constructive model of reading, the science reader, textbooks in science teaching, comprehension instruction, and future directions. The conclusions drawn from the review indicate that existing school programs do little to help students comprehend science text and that some comprehension strategies for expository text respond positively to explicit instruction. Much of the research reviewed disregarded the unique  attributes of science, scientific language, context, and conceptual change. A major shortcoming of current research is the definition and assessment of comprehension. Greater effort is required to measure knowledge constructions, meaningful learning, and implicit comprehension over a period of time. The use of think-alouds, structured interview protocols, concept maps, two-part objective questions, and performance tasks have potential application in science reading research.

AB  - This paper focuses on science anxiety in undergraduate education and then reviews current theories on how to reduce science anxiety. The exploration of the phenomenon of science anxiety points out that this response results not from a lack of self-confidence, but from a lack of a framework of prior knowledge to help order new knowledge; it also indicates that societal, educational and family attitudes convey habits of anxiety and that notions of science aptitude are inherited rather than learned. A discussion of methods to overcome science anxiety touches on relaxation techniques, concept mapping, the importance of prior science skill training, cognitive development from concrete to abstract reasoning, and student collaboration in curriculum development. The paper's central  section reviews extensive research on sex differences in science anxiety, focusing on high levels of female science anxiety and science avoidance. A discussion on motivating students describes barriers to motivation and methods for modifying instructional methods to engage students more effectively including a brief description of how to use computer programs to increase the number of ways the student can approach the material.

AB  - This curriculum guide is designed to help teachers in the middle grades facilitate student understanding of the social and environmental implications and limitations of technological development. The nine activities offer students opportunities to explore social issues arising from the science and technology of the production and management of solid waste. A teacher introduction presents the four components to this solid waste curriculum cited as generally recognized for exploring a science/technology/society (STS) issue: (1) the problem; (2) knowledge; (3) thought; and (4) action. Within this section the art of discussion, informed conversation, reflective conversation, and rules of etiquette for classroom discussions is presented. A section containing a review and teacher  exercise for how to analyze STS issues for points of view includes the concept of "circle of concern," cited as a valuable visual aid for stimulating students' thought and discussion beyond their own concerns. The appendices offer additional information on thought-promoting techniques, a reference list, order forms, and an evaluation form. (MCO)

AB  - An ethnographic study was conducted with the goal of comparing the botanical knowledge of nine sixth grade students with the botanical concepts developed in the elementary textbook series, Science, by Silver Burdett, 1985. The extent to which the child's conceptual framework resembles that of the scientist and the extent to which the textbook reflects the knowledge base and abilities of the child were determined. Each child's language, meanings, classifications, and interpretations of botanical phenomena were examined. The children participated in a series of six interviews and tasks. The children's names for plants and plant classification schemes were examined using domain analysis, componential analysis, and taxonomic analysis. Concept maps were made from both the children's  botanical concepts and those found in the textbook. The concept maps were used to examine the development of each concept. The data revealed that the children have a large body of knowledge about plants and that children's botanical language and meanings appeared to be learned from the lay culture rather than from the textbooks.

AB  - A study was designed to describe how middle school students select, link, and determine relationships between textual and visual information. Fourteen authoring groups were formed from both eighth-grade earth science classes of one veteran teacher in one school. Each group was challenged to produce an informative interactive laservideodisc project about "weather" for their classmates. Students used hypermedia on Macintosh computers with videodisc players and color monitors for authoring these lessons. Project topics included tornadoes, hurricanes, lightning, storms, clouds, rainbows, and floods. Laservideodisc authoring allows students to define and describe links between visual and textual information. "Authoring" groups used several strategies to complete their projects and  were able to produce branching "stacks" on selected weather topics. Student-authored stacks were recorded continuously. These HyperCard records were used to describe the student groups' processes of integrating new information and "authoring." Evidence from student self-reports, audiotape, observations, and products combined to describe a protocol used by students authoring groups with direct control of an intelligent laservideodisc system.

T1  - Preservice Biology Teachers' Subject Matter Structures and Their Relationship to the Act of Teaching.
PY  - 1991/01/01/
N1  - Accession Number: ED331720; Language: English; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Conference Papers; Publication Type: Report; Entry Date: 1991
AB  - Ten preservice biology teachers were followed through the final year of their preservice education to assess the content and stability of their knowledge structures of biology. A questionnaire asking the subjects to list the topics which make up biology and to diagram these topics in relation to one another was completed three times during the Fall Term. The questionnaire was completed again in the Spring Term during student teaching and was followed by an interview. Qualitative analysis of the data attempted to derive any evident patterns among and within the preservice teachers' stated subject matter structures. The data suggest that preservice teachers' knowledge structures of biology are extremely fragile and are influenced by the opportunity to think about teaching subject  matter. Teaching, and courses specifically related to science teaching, provided integrating themes for the perception of isolated biology topics created by college science coursework. These results suggest that courses in science education may be the natural and most effective location for initial reflection on the integrating themes of science, but that the translation of such understandings may not be realistic for the novice teacher who gives priority to planning and classroom management. Since many of the new reforms in science education depend on the incorporation of integrating themes, inservice programs may be critical to foster teachers' reflections on subject matter structure and its translation to science instruction.

AB  - This guide is one of a set of 10 science guides, each covering a separate grade in Manitoba, together covering kindergarten through grade 9. The guides have been designed to provide a framework for building scientific concepts and developing the learning of process skills. They replace an earlier set of guides dated 1979. Each guide is essentially the same through the first 16 pages, after which the core units vary appropriately for each academic level. Section 1, "Objectives of the Curriculum," includes the aims of the program and a discussion of the role of science in general education. Section 2, "The Learner," discusses the variety and nature of children, misconceptions in science, and girls in science. Section 3, "The Teaching Environment," includes program implementation,  computers in science, time allotment for the science program, and enrichment activities. Section 4, "Evaluation," discusses student evaluation and safety and provides sample evaluation techniques. Section 5, "Attitudes and Skills," contains subsections on attitudes and values, science/technology/society (STS), environmental education, sustainable development strategies, process development, and problem solving. Section 6, "Scope and Sequence," discusses process development, attitude development, a general program overview K-4, and concept maps for the grade covered. A suggested minimum materials list for the K-4 Science program is also included. The conceptual structures, objectives, activities, and references for the core units are provided. Three themes and units within those themes  which are carried through the K-4 program include: (1) environmental interdependency and interaction--living and non-living organisms (kindergarten); (2) matter and energy--properties of objects (kindergarten); and (3) earth, time and space--size, position, and time (kindergarten). A copy of a teacher response questionnaire for the K-9 science program of studies is appended. (KR)

T1  - Scoring Student-Generated Concept Maps in Introductory College Chemistry.

N1  - Accession Number: ED347055; Language: English; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Conference Papers; Publication Type: Report; Entry Date: 1992
AB  - This study presents a quantitative method for scoring concept maps generated by students learning introductory college chemistry. Concept maps measure the amount of chemical information the student possesses, reasoning ability in chemistry, and specific misconceptions about introductory and physical chemistry concepts. They provide a visualization of cognitive structure. When a student draws a concept map for chemical reactions, the result is a model of the student's conceptual framework for understanding the concepts and propositions of chemical change. Developing a valid method for scoring student concept maps will enable educators to evaluate student knowledge free of the bias and arbitrariness often associated with qualitative reviews. Concept maps may be evaluated  quantitatively by categories. The category score for propositional validity reflects student reasoning ability in chemistry. The score significantly correlates with formal reasoning ability in chemistry. The category score for hierarchical structure reflects the amount of chemical information possessed by a student. Students who possess large amounts of information about chemistry, position more vocabulary words within each hierarchical level than the student who demonstrates limited chemical knowledge. It is suggested that the greater a student's understanding of introductory chemistry concepts the more strands are employed in mapping concepts and propositions related to chemical reactions. Low strand count reflected specific misconceptions about Avogadro's Number, the mole concept, and  the Law of Conservation of Matter. (Author/MM)

AB  - One of the most important tasks that teachers undertake is to teach concepts. Without a good understanding of concepts, students have difficulty even understanding the basics. Several approaches to teaching thinking have been analyzed and research concludes that it is more effective to teach thinking in the context of a subject rather than as a separate specially designed course. Three models that affect learning and teach students how to think in a subject are outlined. These models are the Concept Attainment, Inquiry Training, and the Advanced Organizer Models of Teaching. Sample lesson are given using the Concept Attainment and Inquiry Training models to help readers understand how models can be employed in the visual arts. Concept maps have been shown to be highly effective  teaching tools, therefore, this technique is emphasized in the discussion of the Advanced Organizer model. Two examples of concept maps involving two different topics in the visual arts also are presented. (KM)

T1  - The Effect of Level of Information as Presented by Different Technologies on Students' Understanding of Acid, Base, and pH Concepts.

N1  - Accession Number: ED347062; Intended Audience: Researchers; Language: English; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Conference Papers; Publication Type: Report; Entry Date: 1992
AB  - Within high school chemistry the topic of acids, bases, and pH is particularly challenging because robust understanding of the topic depends heavily on the student possessing deep concepts of atoms, molecules, ions, and chemical reactions. Since knowledge is acquired and stored in a dynamic structure, it was investigated in this study how knowledge changed as a result of the student's exposure to a particular type of learning task. Two areas of interest were targeted: the change in the students' understanding of acids, bases, and pH over the course of the treatment and the type of thought processes in which the students engaged while performing the treatment tasks. These understandings and thought processes were followed as a function of three levels of information presented by  the technology: low level as represented by the use of chemical indicator solutions, intermediate level as represented by the use of a pH meter, and high level as represented by the use of a microcomputer-interfaced electronic pH probe. Reported in this paper are students' understandings prior to and after interacting with these technologies. Verbal data and drawings obtained in clinical interviews were used to construct concept maps and to analyze students' molecular concepts. Experts were also interviewed, and their concept maps were analyzed to identify critical nodes on their understanding of acids, bases, and pH. The concept maps and drawings were analyzed and two general conclusions reached: (1) students using microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) activities appeared to construct  more powerful and more meaningful chemical concepts; (2) the microcomputer group's high rates of both erroneous and acceptable links provide evidence that these students were positively engaged in restructuring their chemical knowledge. MBL appears to help students develop deeper understanding of acids, bases, and pH concepts, as indicated by the concept maps showing more detailed differentiation and integration.

T1  - The Natural World as Understood by Selected College Students: A World View Methodological Exploration.

N1  - Accession Number: ED344745; Language: English; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Report; Publication Type: Conference Papers; Entry Date: 1992
AB  - World view variations potentially interfere with science education, particularly when instruction proceeds unaware of the importance of fundamental epistemological structure of learning. The research reported here specifically addresses the cognitive culture of women college students with respect to conceptualizations of nature, a delimitation of world view. Equally important objectives were to develop further the logic of justification and to test the effectiveness of interpretive, ethnographic methods. The approach to cultural study taken in the current research involved the use of logico-structuralism, a world view model adapted from cultural anthropology. The subjects of the study were 20 college students enrolled in a science course. Data were collected via semistructured  ethnographic interviews. The structure came from projection devices used to encourage the participants to talk about the natural world. Three elicitation devices were employed to elicit conversation beyond what the photograph and initial question could accomplish alone. The analysis of interview transcripts followed a grounded theory format. This process led to inferences about students' fundamental views toward the natural world. Several students did not connect knowledge of the natural world with science. Many of the students had a strong aesthetic sense about the natural world. They preferentially understood nature in terms of beauty and design. These students had a strong sense that nature must be conserved. Finally, these students generally viewed the natural world as orderly. If the  science classroom is anything like that suggested by some research, then there is indeed a mismatch between many students' views of the natural world (e.g., aesthetic) and the view presented in science classrooms (e.g., materialistic). An explanation of elicitation devices, conceptualizations of nature codes, and concept maps and narratives of the respondents are appended. (40 references) (KR)

AB  - This study was designed to develop effective and time efficient assessment techniques for self-appraisal of science text and science reading and to assess middle grade students' metacognitive knowledge about science text and science reading. Standardized interviews, word associations, concept maps, and objective examinations were administered to grade 5 students. Preliminary results of the interviews reveal that grade 5 students have reasonable declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge about science text and science reading but much growth is needed for them to become efficient, successful science readers. These results identify metacognitive dimensions regarding science text and science reading that would be strengthened by explicit instructions designed to improve  students' knowledge of the use of science text. Reciprocal teaching was also identified as a promising instructional strategy that provided the support required to develop self-appraisal skills. A list of 64 references is included and structured interview protocols, structured tests for assessing self-appraisal of science reading and science text, a form for concept mapping, and a set of word associations are appended.

AB  - Concept maps provided a measure of subjects' cognitive structures before and after completion of an environmental education course. Concept maps were constructed from expressions taken from the issue "global climate." Expressions were assigned to one of three domains: science, technology or society. Maps were analyzed by constituent propositions, which were categorized by various characteristics including the domains of the expressions connected, the relationship expressed and the strength, determined by a protocol developed for this study. Significant differences were found in the frequencies of occurrence for various proposition characteristics and these were correlated with previous academic experiences. Some proposition characteristics were also correlated with the results of  a final examination. Comparison of concept maps prepared before and after an environmental education course showed some changes in proposition characteristics. A brief description of the course, the expressions used in the concept mapping activity, a description of "networking" symbols and a sample map, the protocol used to evaluate the concept maps, and the results of the statistical analysis are appended.

AB  - The goal of the Toledo, Ohio, Support Teacher Programs has been to improve the learning of math and science concepts at the junior high school level. This goal involves some basic changes in the way teachers interact with each other and with their students. The greatest changes have been in the movement away from the lecture-note-taking-test-taking cycle and in overcoming teaching isolation. The study of research materials dealing with misconceptions and conceptual understanding, especially the work of J. Nussbaum (1985) had a particularly strong impact and led the teachers to emphasize the exposure of misconceptions in their own classrooms. Because traditional approaches had not worked, the teachers realized that they needed to become better listeners; to accomplish this they  adopted the following techniques from the literature: (1) using better questioning methods, working on student and teacher listening skills, making the students do the work without supplying the "right" answer; (2) concept mapping to improve understanding; (3) cooperative learning; and (4) making students write to enhance sense-making. Benefits observed from the use of these techniques, each of which is described in detail, were the following: (1) students become actively engaged in constructing their own meaning; (2) positive interactions occur among students; (3) students display a positive attitude about science; (4) students take more responsibility for their own learning; (5) students feel free to question and probe in a nonthreatening atmosphere; (6) students feel free to take more  risks; (7) students self-esteem is enhanced; and (8) students active involvement results in fewer discipline problems. The program continues, and while progress is slow there seems little doubt that a teaching pattern where teachers talk less and listen more will greatlyy enhance student learning. (KR)

AB  - An investigation of Ontario high school students' understanding of acids and bases with quantitative and qualitative methods revealed misconceptions. A concept map, based on the objectives of the Chemistry Curriculum Guideline, generated multiple-choice items and interview questions. The multiple-choice test was administered to 34 grade 12 students who had completed the grade 11 advanced chemistry program. Eight of these students, from three levels of chemistry achievement (high, medium, and low), participated in 40-minute clinical interviews and follow-up interviews. Analyses of the quantitative and qualitative data revealed that the students held idiosyncratic conceptions of acids and bases which did not coincide with the concepts found in the curriculum guidelines or  prescribed texts. The students in this exploratory study retained their everyday concepts of acids and bases and grasped few of the scientific concepts. More instruction time may help students to develop understanding of scientific concepts such as ions and pH. This document includes an introduction, discussions of methods and analyses, cases and concept maps, findings and a list of 39 references. Appendices include a copy of the multiple choice test, and a copy of each of the interview tasks. (Author/CW)

AB  - Results of recent studies into the use of concept mapping heuristic seem to demonstrate that meaningful learning results through its use in science classrooms. This study sought to find out if the metacognitive strategy of concept mapping reduces anxiety and thereby enhances achievement in biology. A total of 51 senior secondary one (grade 10) students participated in this experiment. Two instruments--the Zuckerman Affective Adjective Checklist and a Biology Achievement Test--were used in pre- and posttest administrations to measure the treatment effect on anxiety and achievment, respectively. Findings support the stand that concept mapping is significantly more effective than traditional/expository strategy in enhancing learning in biology. It has, in addition, positively  affected students' anxiety towards the learning of biology. A tendency for concept mapping to significantly reduce anxiety towards biology more in males than in females was noticed. There are 29 references. (Author/YP)

AB  - The reliability, sensitivity, and criterion-related validity of concept comparison (CC) ratings and computer-derived multidimensional scaling (MDS) maps were studied as ways of assessing reading comprehension. Fifteen experts (2 district coordinators and 13 reading specialists/special education teachers) were included in this study. Reliability was studied by comparing CC ratings and maps produced independently by 5 teachers reading eight 250-word passages from elementary level science and social studies texts. For the 3 of the 8 passages that had sufficient interrater reliability, instrument validity was assessed with 104 reading disabled junior and senior high school students. A randomized control group design compared CC tasks completed before and after students read related  or unrelated passages. Students reading related passages produced post-reading CC scores significantly more closely related to teacher scores than did readers of unrelated passages. Student and expert CC scores were then correlated with student scores on: (1) vocabulary and reading comprehension sections from norm-referenced reading tests; and (2) maze tests, multiple-choice questions, and oral reading fluency performance, all based on the passages. These three measures were substantially related to post-reading CC scores, but not to pre-reading scores. Standardized test scores were not significantly related to pre-reading or post-reading CC scores. Reliability and validity results support further research on the use of CC tasks and MDS maps for assessing reading comprehension for older  disabled readers. Nine data tables, six figures, and three appendices providing study results are included. A 132-item list of references is provided. (Author/SLD)

AB  - In studying the earth's natural resources and the systems governing them, students need to understand the interrelationships of resources and ecosystems. This curriculum program for junior high school students investigates the environment as a whole. It is designed to supplement existing school curricula in science and social studies by presenting activities that draw from students the concepts of interdependence, change, adaptation, energy flow, and diversity. The curriculum guide contains eight units of study: (1) Air Resources; (2) Cultural Resources; (3) Energy Resources; (4) Forest Resources; (5) Recreation Resources; (6) Water Resources; (7) Wildlife Resources; and (8) an overview unit on how the curriculum integrates the management of these resources. Each unit consists of  an overview and a series of factsheets, a concept map, an activities matrix for factsheet references, students activities, a curriculum rationale, and a glossary of terms. A list of 121 additional Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) selected references, TVA publications, curricular and book resources, resource materials, and resource organizations is included. (MDH)

AB  - Many researchers believe that prior knowledge is the single most important variable influencing learning. Learning in the classroom is determined or affected positively or negatively, to some degree, by the knowledge people bring to the classroom. This study was designed to: (1) assess fifth- and eighth-grade Korean students' misconceptions of concepts related to photosynthesis; and (2) investigate change in students' concept understanding as it related to logical reasoning ability, textbook emphasis and background variables. Results showed that students in both groups had misconceptions of concepts related to photosynthesis--the meaning of making food, the use of light by plants, the functions of plant roots and leaves, photosynthetic products, and requirements of elements.  Reductions in misconceptions between grade 5 and grade 8 was on items regarding the use of light by plants, exchange of materials between organisms in a system, knowledge of glucose, protein, fat, and nitrogen, and the skill of reading a graph. Appendices include a concept map of photosynthesis, tests, the questionnaire used, variable labels, correlation matrices, and a comparative achievement analysis. (RT)

AB  - Interactive computer programs, developed at Indiana University's Learning Skills Center, were designed to model effective strategies for reading biology and psychology textbooks. For each subject area, computer programs and textbook passages were used to instruct and model for students how to identify key concepts, compare and contrast concepts, and graphically map relationships among key concepts. One hundred and eighty-four undergraduate students of matched ability from a major university and from a two-year community college were assigned to treatment and control groups to evaluate program effectiveness. Students who used the program significantly outperformed control group students, and learned strategies transferred to new and unmodeled textbook chapters. Data are presented  in tabular form. Appendixes include a copy of a paper presented at the 1987 National Reading Conference, "The Effectiveness of Interactive Computer Assisted Modeling in Teaching Study Strategies and Concept Mapping of College Textbook Material" (L. Mikulecky), and extensive excerpts from the students' and instructors' guides for the project. (Author/GL)

AB  - This paper describes a joint research project between science educators and computer science software engineers. A computer software system based on cognitive learning theory was designed that was intended to be relevant to teaching, learning, curriculum development, and research in science education. The generic prototype software system was designed to serve three purposes: (1) to aid instructors and students of science in the construction of a meaningful knowledge base in a science discipline by means of concept mapping; (2) to serve as an intelligent, individualized, and interactive tutor for learning the concepts and conceptual relationships in a specified knowledge domain; and (3) to generate a database for subsequent analysis of, and research on, student misconceptions and  how these might change through computer-based instruction. The database generated by the software program was designed to be used to guide subsequent construction, modification, or improvement of curricula. (TW)

AB  - The purpose of this document is to develop a usable science teaching guide based on the process skills methodology for the middle school life science teacher. It is intended to provide an efficient and effective tool for the interested teacher to use to develop the skills of the methodology. It could also be used as companion to the latest set of science and health competencies issued by the New Mexico State Department of Education, and as a supplement to life science textbooks. Part I, "Science in the Contemporary Classroom," presents a theoretical foundation for teaching science in a middle school classroom. Part II, "Life Science in the Las Cruces (New Mexico) Middle School Classroom," provides a model for incorporating process skills into teaching. Both parts are an effort to  further the use of the process skills approach in a middle school life science program, which will be achieved as teachers come to believe that the outcomes justify the effort. A summary is provided in the form of a concept map, developed to show the relationships between the key ideas. (TW)

AB  - This course of study is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of an elementary school science program. In addition to high individual pupil achievement at each grade level, this program is also designed to provide a broad and comprehensive continuum of experiences that lead toward the obtainment of the identified science goals. A strong hands-on component is emphasized in this program. In addition, single topic books are provided to encourage pupils to pursue further inquiries into topics that interest them. The intended result is a "do-read" sequence that enables pupils to have concrete experiences prior to extending their understanding of the content through the use of print materials. A unit format was selected to allow maximum flexibility in building, teaching, and  maintaining the elementary school science program. Each unit contributes to the educational outcome identified for the grade level and is the basis for further study at the next level. In this way, a scope and sequence is established and continuity in learning is promoted. Major themes for each grade level form the basis for this continuity. Many of the units incorporate activities from programs such as ESS, SCIIS, and SAVI/SELPH. Specific lesson plans, using the Elements of Instruction, were written by teams of classroom teachers to reduce planning time and teacher anxiety in teaching science. Section 1, "Foundations," includes K-12 learner outcome goals, content, processes and attitudes taught/developed, and a grade 1-6 outcome summary by domain. Section 2, "Science Instructional  Program," includes the themes, concept maps, and objectives for each grade level. Section 3, "Environmental Education," includes guidelines, objectives, and resources. Sections 4 and 5 cover supplies and ordering equipment. Section 6, "Science Instruction," includes science fairs, safety, and instructional strategies. Section 7, "Sample Lessons"; includes three lessons for grade 1 and two lessons for grade 4. (KR)

AB  - A study evaluated the effectiveness of a series of print materials and interactive computer-guided study programs designed to lead undergraduate students to apply basic textbook reading and concept mapping strategies to the study of science and social science textbooks. Following field testing with 25 learning skills students, 50 freshman biology students enrolled at Indiana University were divided into treatment and control groups. Both groups read two 7-10 page biology textbook selections. Treatment students scheduled three weekly one-hour appointments using the computer programs, which helped students identify key concepts, write summary statements comparing and contrasting concepts, and graphically map relationships among concepts. After each lesson students answered a  questionnaire on the usability of the lesson, and on completion of the last lesson, chapter examinations were given along with an open-ended questionnaire evaluating the program. One week after the chapter exam, treatment subjects read a new biology text and were given an exam on the new material. Control students were provided only with the text and completed the same examination taken by the treatment group. They also returned one week later to repeat the process with the new text. Findings showed that treatment students significantly outperformed control students for both texts in ability to link terms and map concept relationships. Questionnaire data indicated that computer instruction was viewed positively as a way to learn strategies for reading difficult material. (Two tables of  data are included, and 23 references are appended.) (MM)

AB  - Student knowledge in a subject area prior to and after instruction has traditionally been assessed by administering a pre- and post-test, usually multiple choice, though recent studies criticize the use of even the best-constructed multiple choice tests. This study assessed college freshmen's knowledge before and after a laboratory experience in molecular genetics, based on results from pre- and post-lab clinical interviews and multiple choice tests. The specific areas addressed by this research were: (1) students' misconceptions and missing concepts in molecular genetics as revealed by interviews; (2) changes in student comprehension and knowledge as a result of laboratory instruction as revealed by interviews; (3) student scores on both multiple choice tests and interview  tasks; and (4) discrepancies found between knowledge expressed on multiple choice tests versus interviews. Study results indicated that interviews were effective in revealing student misconceptions and missing concepts and that the amount of data generated by interviews was substantially greater than information gained from multiple choice test scores on student comprehension of concepts in molecular genetics. Concept maps are included and appendices contain the test instruments and interview transcripts of representative students. (ML)

AB  - In an effort to contribute information for science teachers and curriculum developers in Maine, this study generated base line data on 4th, 8th, and 11th grade students' knowledge of marine science and natural resources principles in relation to the Gulf of Maine. Five concept maps representing 15 major content principles were developed. Two hundred twenty-six students from 12 schools in Maine were interviewed on marine science, natural resources and decision-making concepts and principles. Student knowledge was then classified according to correct concepts, missing concepts and misconceptions. Similarities and differences between the three grade levels were analyzed and compared to results of the Maine Assessment of Educational Progress in Science. The results indicated that the  students in the sample did learn a few basic marine and natural resource concepts in the elementary grades, but that there was little further assimilation of new concepts or differentiation of existing concepts as students progressed through the grades. The results are discussed with regard to possible implications for future marine science curricula. (TW)

AB  - An analysis of science teacher's knowledge of specific biology and physics topics and the effects of this knowledge on their planning for instruction and on simulated teaching are discussed in this report. Six experienced secondary school teachers participated in the study. Each teacher's knowledge of a biology topic and a physics topic was assessed using summary free recall, concept-map line labeling, and sorting tasks. The knowledge varied on four dimensions: (1) knowledge of topic; (2) knowledge of other discipline concepts, principles, and topics; (3) knowledge of conceptual schemes; and (4) knowledge of approaches or ways of connecting the topic to other topics in the discipline. The study results suggested that prior teacher knowledge of subject matter contributed to the  transformation of the written curriculum into an enactive curriculum. Appendices include the physics and biology knowledge schemata. (ML)

AB  - This information sheet examines three areas: (1) what research tells about problem-solving in chemistry; (2) why students have such difficulty in solving chemistry problems; and (3) if there are some ways of teaching students to solve problems that are more effective than others. From several research studies on problem-solving in chemistry, it is clear that the major reason students are unable to solve problems is that they do not understand the concepts on which the problems are based. Based on this finding (as well as others), it is recommended that teachers use various procedures to help their students become more successful in solving problems. They include using analogies and schematic diagrams, wait time, and concept maps. (JN)

AB  - This paper analyzes the hardware and software features that would be desirable in a computer-based semantic network system for representing biology knowledge. It then describes in detail a prototype network of molecular biology knowledge that has been developed using Filevision software and a Macintosh computer. The prototype contains about 100 linked concept maps. Design principles are delineated. For example, the decision was made not to include direct links between members of a set such as "RNA" and "DNA." To move from one to the other in the network it is necessary to move up the hierarchy to "nucleic acids" and back down. This requirement is pedagogically attractive and reduces clutter. Many other such principles are required to assure consistency in map generation. Working  with information in the computer-based semantic network provides an experience heretofore unavailable. Project members find it is fun, and somewhat challenging even for creators of the database, to find paths from point X to point Y in the database. Moving through the net requires an integration of concepts that seems qualitatively different from that encountered in most other interactions with academic subject matter. (Author)

AB  - This eight-chapter book clearly presents a theory of how children learn and, therefore, how teachers and others can help children think about science as well as other topics. Its ideas and techniques may be adopted for preschoolers when objects are conceptually ordered, or for theoretical physicists when findings are conceptually organized. In addition, the book provides evidence that these propositions work, that children can learn how to learn. The eight chapters focus on: (1) the nature of learning about learning; (2) concept mapping for meaningful learning; (3) the Vee heuristic for understanding knowledge and knowledge production; (4) strategies for instructional planning; (5) strategies for using concept mapping and Vee diagramming for planning a total curriculum program as  well as specific instructional strategies; (6) the use of the Vee for evaluation; (7) the interview as an evaluation tool; and (8) improving educational research. Appendices include sample concept maps, sample Vee diagrams, and sample forms for using a child in a research project and for application for research privileges. (JN)

AB  - Student variables which influence attainment of ecological concepts and conceptual systems were investigated. Researcher-designed paper/pencil and free-sort categorization tests were administered to 256 Science Curriculum Improvement Study (SCIS) students in grades 4-6. Findings are: (1) grade and ability, not sex, influenced concept attainment and conceptual system; (2) sequence of concept development was not influenced by grade, ability, or sex; (3) sixth-grade students conceptualized life requirements, feeding relationships, food-mineral cycle, and community-environment interactions but not the higher-order classificatory concepts or oxygen-carbon dioxide cycle; (4) discipline experts, not elementary students, possessed conceptual systems based upon higher-order concepts; and  (5) concept attainment was promoted by a conceptual system similar to the discipline structure. Recommendations include continuing concrete activities, investigating effectiveness of SCIS and other elementary programs in developing higher-order classificatory concepts and the oxygen-carbon dioxide cycle, emphasizing development of conceptual systems, and investigating teachers' ability to effectively utilize concrete experiences and concept maps.

AB  - In a German study, students' descriptions of the processes in an electric circuit were related to the energy view as it is used in physics. (The representation of students' concepts describing the electric circuit is of importance because structured concepts may influence the perception and description of processes, the handling of electrical devices, and the assimilation of physical concepts.) It was shown that students generally do not distinguish between the circulating current and the unidirectional energy flow. Usually, students related current, bulb, and battery in a way that forms the students' so-called energy view. Several simple tasks were applied to isolate the correct information from information that is compatible with the student's energy view. The concept mapping  of results showed a dominant students' energy view before and after instruction. Better results were obtained when the different views were explicitly taught. These recommendations for teachers were made: to present information on single concepts as well as on integrating views, to isolate situations that run counter to the student's representation and to produce a conflict between it and prospective learning materials, and to develop the different aspects of a voltage concept.

AB  - This study describes efforts to apply principles of systematic knowledge representation (concept mapping and computer-based semantic networking techniques) to the domain of ecology. A set of 24 relationships and modifiers is presented that seem sufficient for describing all ecological relationships discussed in an introductory course. Many of these relationships are identical to those used in describing molecular biology. The relationships can be divided into these classes: analytical; spatial; temporal; process; connector; and modifier. Methods used in developing and testing these relationships are described, including use of materials in an undergraduate plant ecology course. A prototype version of a semantic network of ecology knowledge is also described. A student can move  through the network from concept to related concept via a relational pathway. In addition, at any time a user can "move up" to a definition frame for a concept or "move down" to an example frame for that concept. These additional features seem essential for adequately summarizing ecology knowledge. Their utility is not, however, limited to ecology since they could be added on to previously developed networks such as molecular biology. (Author/JN)

AB  - A small set of relationships has been identified which appears to be sufficient for describing all molecular and cellular reactions and structures discussed in an introductory biology course. A precise definition has been developed for each relationship. These 20 relationships are of four types: (1) analytical; (2) spatial; (3) temporal; and (4) process. Three different computer-based semantic network representations of molecular biology knowledge were developed. Two list-structure nets were useful in identifying problems in net design. The most successful of the three prototypes involved spatial representations (concept maps) for each concept, with the maps being linked together to form a network. Various styles of knowledge representation were tested with students enrolled in  introductory biology. The students were most enthusiastic about exercises in which partially completed concept maps were given to them and they had to fill in the missing pieces (concepts or relationships). The systematic analysis of relationships between concepts reveals relationships not explicitly perceived before, even by experts. It is believed that these representational techniques will be useful in facilitating student learning. (Author/JN)

AB  - This report explains an evaluative study of the conceptual and affective development of students associated with the Floating Lab Program, an experiential field project sponsored by the University of New Hampshire and the Maine Sea Grant Program. The field program involved an opportunity for students to have hands-on experiences aboard a 65-foot vessel outfitted with various kinds of oceanographic sampling equipment. Students and teachers operate equipment, collect samples, and record data. An assessment of this experience was made with 20 eighth grade students. Modified clinical interviews that incorporated concept mapping and concept propositional analysis were administered pre- and post-trip. Results indicated that students interviewed exhibited an increase in marine science  concepts and values toward coastal zone resources. The report includes a number of knowledge and value claims and recommendations for teachers, program developers and researchers. (ML)

AB  - Science Curriculum Improvement Study (SCIS) students in grades 4-6 were used to investigate ecological concept formation. Researcher-designed, multiple-choice and free-sort tasks were administered. Statistics utilized included analysis of variance, Spearman correlation, multiple regression, frequency distributions, and latent partition analysis. Findings show that: (1) grade and ability, not sex, influenced concept attainment and similarity of conceptual system to discipline structure; (2) sequence of concept attainment was not influenced by grade, ability, or sex; (3) concept attainment was promoted by a conceptual system similar to the discipline structure; (4) sixth-graders recognized life requirements, interactions via food, mineral, gas exchange, and community groups, but  not attributes of higher-order concepts (producer, consumer, decomposer, environmental factors); (5) discipline experts, not students, related examples to higher-order concepts. Recommendations for grades K-6 curriculum are to promote conceptual systems similar to discipline structure, to base concept maps upon lower-order concepts or attributes, to eliminate higher-order concepts, and to emphasize interactions of plants, animals, decayers, non-living materials, feeding relationships, and life requirements.

AB  - Concept mapping, a technique based on David Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning, involves the organization of concepts into an hierarchical arrangement. Suggestions for incorporating this learning strategy into the biology classroom are presented and discussed. Steps in concept mapping include: (1) identifying important concepts in the study materials; (2) ranking concepts from the most general to most specific; and (3) arranging concepts on a piece of paper and defining connections between related concepts. A concept map for animals is developed from a textbook paragraph. Three student-designed maps (dealing with photosynthesis, cells, and organic compounds) and a form for quick scoring are included in an appendix. Also included are forms for assessing student-developed  concept maps and a list of definitions for the word "concept." (DH)

AB  - This publication contains a selection of science education research papers, beginning with an overview of trends in science education cognitive developmental research and theory in the United Kingdom. Papers that follow focus on developments in studies of thinking and reasoning, including work on concept mapping and conceptual change. Closely associated are papers focusing on teaching and learning, including studies on teachers, students, or both teachers and students, relating to verbal and non-verbal classroom communication; effect of teacher background on performance; differences in problem-solving performances; effects of instruction on understanding; and computer simulation as a means to aid concept development. Additional papers are representative of work on attitudes and  perceptions. These include use of commonality analysis in analyzing teachers' attitudes and practice toward primary science, medical school students' perceptions of science, study of scientific attitudes of science educators who study scientific attitudes, students' attitudes toward conservation of environment and environmental issues, and others. The final paper uses an analysis of earlier science textbooks to identify a trend away from seeing "nature" as a symbol of performance, such that observed complexities and changes in the meaning of the symbol can be more readily accepted.

AB  - Based upon Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning, this study focused on the use of concept maps (diagrams that portray relationships among concepts in a given area of study) to help students identify logical relationships between a new concept and concepts already known. Relationships of a learner's prior knowledge and cognitive development to (1) the ability to construct concept maps and (2) the knowledge of environmental concepts as a result of using self-constructed concept maps were investigated. A secondary purpose was to compare three versions of concept mapping. Students (N=114) taking an introductory natural resources course at The Ohio State University were divided into high and low prior knowledge groups based upon pretest results. Within each group, learners were  randomly assigned to one of three concept mapping groups: (1) hierarchical-propositional; (2) hierarchical; and (3) propositional. Each student constructed three assigned maps of environmental concepts during the course and completed a posttest on these concepts and an attitude instrument at the end of the course. Findings indicate that prior knowledge, cognitive development, and reasoning ability showed little relationship to students' concept mapping performance. For two groups, prior knowledge explained more variability in posttest scores than did cognitive development. (Author/DC)

AB  - Reported is a study of the relationship between degree of concept relatedness of an instructional sequence and a person's locus of control orientation. Locus of control orientation for the 541 high school biology students involved in the study was evaluated as measured by the adult Nowicki-Strickland scale. The experimental instructional treatment stressed conceptual relationships through conceptual cues and concept mapping exercises, while the control treatment did not. Dependent variables measured were scores on a meaningful learning posttest and on a six-week retention test. Two-way analyses of covariance by treatment and by locus of control resulted in a significant treatment-locus of control interaction effect for retention test scores. Subjects with an external locus of  control orientation who were exposed to the experimental treatment outperformed the control group. However, students with an internal locus of control orientation retained the same amount of information regardless of treatment group. (Author/WB)

PY  - 1981/01/01/
N1  - Accession Number: ED200437; Language: English; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Report; Entry Date: 1981
AB  - Reported is a research project which investigated whether junior high students in the Ithaca, New York, area can acquire and use the "concept mapping" and "Gowin's 'V' mapping" strategies to facilitate meaningful learning. Concept mapping involves the identification, hierarchical organization, and graphic depiction of relationships among concepts in a body of study material. These procedures are consistent with Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning. The second learning strategy involves recognizing that all knowledge in the sciences is constructed by using records and record transforming procedures which are guided by the concepts, principles and theories that people employ. Gowin's "V" is a heuristic device that students use to graphically illustrate the interplay between the  methodological and conceptual elements of each episode of knowledge-making, such as a laboratory investigation. Although many project activities centered on implementation of the two learning strategies, the positive cognitive and affective data lend support to the effectiveness of this "learning how to learn" project. Included in the appendix are the teacher's handbook and samples of student-constructed concept maps and "V" maps. (Author/WB)

AB  - This handbook was prepared for use in any classroom to aid the student in understanding how to become a better learner and how to learn meaningfully. This program is based on Ausubel's cognitive learning theory which places emphasis on the differences between meaningful learning and rote learning. To acquire knowledge meaningfully means that the learner must incorporate new knowledge into concepts the learner already has. The program is designed to extend, modify and elaborate these concepts, partly through providing instruction in new relationships among concepts that the student already has, and partly by providing new relevant concepts about learning. Included are: (1) the learning process, (2) the nature of knowledge, and (3) how to extract meaning from materials studied.  Also included are instructions on how to make concept maps and the use of Gowins Knowledge "V". (Author/DS)

AB  - Described is how teachers can use the Concept Structuring Analysis Technique (ConSAT) as a diagnostic, learning, and assessment task in teaching science. In essence, ConSAT assists students in organizing concepts on paper so that they may link what they already know to what they have to learn. The technique thus applies the philosophical notion of discipline structure and the psychological notion of knowledge structure to science instruction. In addition to illustrating ConSAT's use in teacher-student interactions and in assessment, the application of ConSAT to instruction in reading science texts and in answering science problems is discussed.

AB  - A model of human information processing is summarized and discussed in terms of the implications of the model and its associated technologies for curriculum research and development. Description of the model focuses on its input and output systems and its memory systems, i.e., long-term memory (LTM). Semantic networks are described as a representation of LTM, particularly the work of Lindsay, Norman, and Rumelhart at San Diego. Curricular implications discussed include analysis of disciplinary knowledge and the use of concept maps to represent that knowledge, cognitive objectives expressing the changes intended in a student's cognitive structures or processes, curriculum organization decisions, content analysis, and finally, evaluation of student learning (particularly what is  involved in answering a typical classroom or test question). Conclusions regarding the potential and actualized contributions of cognitive science for curriculum research and development are then discussed. (Author/VT)

AB  - Flow-diagrams, algorithms, decision logic tables, and concept maps are presented in detail as methods for teaching practical procedures, problem solving, and basic concepts in microbial genetics. It is suggested that the flexible use of these methods should lead to an improved understanding of microbial genetics. (Author/MA)

T1  - Children's Concepts of Natural Phenomena: Use of a Cognitive Mapping Approach to Describe These Concepts.
PY  - 1975/01/01/
N1  - Accession Number: ED106117; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Conference Papers; Entry Date: 1975
AB  - Reported is a study based on the summary findings of a series of studies which indicated that many children who receive organized instruction designed around the few major concepts of science do, in fact, use scientific models to explain their observations of natural phenomena. The instruction that children in the study received was delivered by means of an audiotutorial (A-T) science program, the design and planning of which were based in part on the educational psychology of David Ausubel. Background information about the Audio-Tutorial Elementary Science Project (ATESP) is presented. A carrel set-up picture for one A-T science lesson is presented and described. The method of inquiry chosen included the use of Piaget's revised clinical method for interviewing and is described  in detail. Concept maps are presented, serving as guides for interviews dealing with the various concepts. Data are presented for 95 children who were present for all of the four interviews conducted as part of the program. Conclusions drawn project positive results. (Author/EB)
